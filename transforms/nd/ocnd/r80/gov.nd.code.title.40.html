        When a municipality has the power to contract but there is a defect in the manner of exercising that power, the municipality can be held liable for the reasonable value of benefits received and retained; where city was acting within its powers to enter into a labor agreement with firefighters but the city did not comply with the statutory procedural requirements necessary to form a contract with a municipality, city’s liability to firefighters was limited to the reasonable value of services rendered.

    Removal of building when taxes and special assessments or share of bonded indebtedness are due — Lien — Penalty.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No person may remove a building from any lot or tract of land in any municipality, unless it is assessed as personalty or exempt from taxation, until after the taxes and special assessments then due have been paid, nor until the owner shall have paid into the sinking fund for the retirement of any bonded indebtedness of the municipality an amount equal to the just share of the tax which would then be required against the property in the municipality to pay the principal outstanding, less amount in sinking funds, of the bonded indebtedness of the municipality. The phrase “taxes and special assessments then due” means all taxes and special assessments that have been levied plus a pro rata estimated tax for the current assessment year. For property classified as residential, “special assessments then due” means the sum of the installments of special assessments certified to the county auditor for extension on the tax list plus the pro rata installment of the special assessment to be certified in the current assessment year. If the building is removed without the payment of the taxes and special assessments and pro rata share of bonded indebtedness, the taxes, special assessments, and pro rata share of bonded indebtedness shall be a lien on the building notwithstanding its removal as well as upon the lot, lots, tract, or tracts of land from which the building was removed. This section does not apply where a building is removed to permit the erection or installation of improvements equal or greater in value than the building removed. Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

      Beginning with the 1996 biennial municipal elections, and every four years thereafter, all cities in North Dakota, regardless of their form of government, must put on the ballot the question of whether the minutes of its governing body shall be published in its official newspaper. If voters approve publication, the governing body shall, within seven days after each of its meetings, give its official newspaper, for publication, the complete minutes, or a complete summary showing the substantive actions taken at the meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Roll call votes must be published, but may be indicated as “unanimous” when appropriate. A list of the individual checks written by the city and approved by the governing body, showing the payee and the amount of each check, must be published. However, employee salary checks need not be published if the governing body elects to publish an annual salary schedule for each employee. When applicable, these minutes may be labeled as being published subject to the governing body’s review and revision. The minutes shall continue to be published until disapproved at a succeeding quadrennial election.

An advisory study committee is encouraged to prepare a comprehensive program for the performance of local government functions and the furnishing of local government services within the jurisdiction of the governing body or cooperating governing bodies that established the committee. In its study, the committee may consider:

      The board of county commissioners shall make a written record of its findings on each of the assertions contained in the petition and shall provide any interested person with a copy of those findings. If the board is satisfied that the petition should be approved, it shall make an order fixing the time and the places within the boundaries of the proposed municipality at which an election may be held to determine the question of incorporation as requested in the petition. If the territory described in the petition is located in more than one county, the board shall, after consultation with the board of the other county involved, designate a separate election place in each county in which any part of the territory described in the petition is situated. The board shall name the persons to act as judges of the election in each such election place.

     <p>
      If the officers of a township and of a municipality which has been organized from territory situated therein cannot agree upon the valuation of any real estate, or of any indivisible property which is held jointly, or upon the just apportionment of the joint indebtedness, the officers of the township or municipality, upon five days’ notice of the time and place, may apply to the director of the office of administrative hearings for arbitration of such differences. Thereupon, the director shall appoint three residents of the county, not residents or taxpayers of the municipality or township involved, to act as arbitrators. After being duly sworn to perform the duties imposed upon them, the arbitrators shall view and appraise the property and fix the valuation thereof for the purpose of making the division. If the property to be divided is personal property and no satisfactory arrangement can be made otherwise, it must be sold at public auction to the highest bidder, and the municipality and township may bid at the sale. The township and municipality involved in the arbitration shall share equally in the costs and expenses of the arbitration. The director of the office of administrative hearings shall request payment from the township and municipality and the township and municipality shall pay to the office of administrative hearings both the costs and expenses of the arbitration proceedings and the cost of the services provided by the arbitrators and the director of the office of administrative hearings.

      Any city which shall have operated for more than six years since the adoption of the city council system of government or since the last election at which the question of changing from the council system was rejected by a vote of the qualified electors, may change its organization thereunder and adopt the city commission form of government. The proceeding to change shall be initiated by a petition asking for such change signed by not less than forty percent of the qualified electors of the city, as determined by the total number of qualified electors voting at the preceding general election. The signatures to such petition need not be appended to a single paper, but one of the signers upon each paper shall make oath before an officer competent to administer oaths that each signature appearing upon such paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Each petition, in addition to the names of the signers, shall contain the name, address, and age of each petitioner, and the length of the petitioner’s residence in the city. Any petitioner shall be permitted to withdraw that petitioner’s name from a petition within five days after the petition is filed.

    Change from or to commission system of government — Petition required.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any city that has operated for more than six years under or since changing from the city commission system of government may change its governmental organization and adopt the city council form of government or the modern council form of government or revert to the city commission form of government. The proceeding to change or revert shall be initiated either by a resolution by the governing body or by a petition asking for such change signed by not less than twenty-five percent of the qualified electors of the city. In no event, however, shall the petition contain less than thirty signatures. In any city having six or more municipal election precincts, not more than twenty percent of the petitioners may reside in any single precinct. For purposes of this section, the term “qualified electors of the city” means the total number of qualified electors voting for the office of the chief executive officer of the city at the preceding city election. The signatures to such petition need not be appended to a single paper, but one of the signers upon each paper shall make oath before an officer competent to administer oaths that each signature appearing upon such paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be and that such person purports to be not less than eighteen years of age and a resident of the city. Each petition, in addition to the names of the signers, shall contain the name of the street upon and the number of the house in which each petitioner resides. Any petitioner shall be permitted to withdraw that petitioner’s name from a petition within five days after the petition is filed. If the proceeding to change from or revert to a commission system of government is initiated by petition, the question may not be placed on the ballot more often than every four years.

        Supreme court will not overturn discretionary act by local commission for failure to publish notice and hold a public hearing in accordance with the published notice when that issue was never raised before the commission, which, therefore, was not given an opportunity to correct the error, if any, before rendering a final decision. An issue not raised in an initial proceeding ordinarily may not be raised on appeal. Lynch v. Williston City Comm'n, 460 N.W.2d 136, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        If the municipality has concurrent jurisdiction with the state to punish an offense, an ordinance punishing the offense is valid, even though there may be a statute under which the offender may also be punished, and a conviction under the one jurisdiction is not a bar to a conviction under the other.

      Whenever it becomes necessary for the general welfare, public health, fire protection, or public safety to order an owner or occupant of property to do certain work provided for by ordinance, and such owner or occupant refuses to conduct or comply with such order, the work may be done by the municipality and the owner or occupant of such property billed for the same by the municipality, or whenever a municipality for the general welfare, public health, fire protection, or public safety establishes by ordinance and maintains and operates a garbage and rubbish collection and removal system, the cost of such service may be charged to the owner or occupant of the property served.

        The regulation of the use and sale of alcohol by a municipality is limited to imposing a penalty equal to a class B misdemeanor. City of Fargo v. Little Brown Jug, 468 N.W.2d 392, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        In order to harmonize the statutes granting and limiting the power of a municipality with N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05, and to avoid an implicit repeal of that power to regulate the use and sale of alcoholic beverages, the prohibition in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 against a municipal ordinance superseding state law, does not prevent a municipality from enacting an ordinance with a penalty which differs from the penalty which could be imposed under similar state law when the city has enacted an ordinance authorizing imposition of up to the maximum penalty the city may impose under state law, and the enactment is in an area of law in which the city is authorized to engage in regulation through the enactment of an ordinance.

        A provision of the Fargo Municipal Code that regulated the same offense as N.D.C.C. § 5-02-06, but provided that a violation constituted a class B misdemeanor carrying a penalty of a fine not to exceed $500, or imprisonment not to exceed 30 days, or both, did not supersede the state statute in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05, although it provided a lesser penalty than that mandated by the state statute. N.D.C.C. § 40-05-01(29) granted municipalities the power to regulate the use and licensure of alcoholic beverages while N.D.C.C. § 40-05-06 limited their ability to impose a penalty greater than a class B misdemeanor; the penalty of a municipal ordinance could differ from the penalty imposed by the state law in those situations in which the municipality authorized imposition of up to the maximum allowable municipal penalty that was lesser than the state law penalty for an equivalent statute.

      <li id="t40c40-05s40-05-24ol11">
       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, before granting a property tax incentive on any parcel of property that is anticipated to receive a property tax incentive for more than five years, the governing body of a city shall send the chairman of each county commission and the president of each school district affected by the property tax incentive a letter, by certified mail, which provides notice of the terms of the proposed property tax incentive.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-05s40-05-24ol12">
       Within thirty days from receipt of the letter, each affected county and school district shall notify the city, in writing, whether the county or school district elects to participate in granting the tax incentive on the county or school district portion of tax levied on the property. The notification from a county or school district electing not to participate must include a letter explaining any reason for which the entity elected not to participate and whether the county or school district is willing to negotiate the terms of the property tax incentive with the city.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-05s40-05-24ol13">
       If the city does not receive a response from an affected county or school district within thirty days of delivery of the letter, the county and school district must be treated as participating in the property tax incentive.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-05s40-05-24ol14">
       The term “negotiation” as used in this section means the governing body of an affected county or school district may negotiate the terms of participating in the tax incentive, including the duration of the tax incentive and the taxable value selected for the base year for purposes of computing tax increments.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-05s40-05-24ol15">
       If an agreement is reached through negotiation under this section, the property tax incentive must be applied in accordance with the agreement.

       Property subject to a development agreement entered pursuant to section 40-58-20.1 before August 1, 2017, and all amendments to the development agreement, is not subject to the requirements under this section.

     <p>
      Within sixty days after proceedings have been initiated for a home rule charter, the governing body of the city shall appoint a charter commission, composed of at least five members, to frame the charter, unless a petition proposing a charter pursuant to section 40-05.1-02 prescribes the composition of the commission or the manner by which the composition of the commission is to be determined. The chairman of the charter commission shall be designated by the governing body and shall be a charter commission member. Compensation and expenses of commission members shall be as determined by the governing body. The governing body may furnish the charter commission with office space, clerical help, legal and other assistance, and supplies, and may appropriate and pay for same out of its general funds. The charter commission shall hold at least one public hearing on the proposed charter, and may use other suitable means to disseminate information, receive suggestions and comments, and encourage public discussion of the proposed charter. The commission shall prepare and submit the charter within one year after appointment, unless the governing body allows additional time for submission of the charter. The proposed charter shall then be published once in the city’s official newspaper as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-01s40-01-09" target="_self">40-01-09.</a></cite> However, cities with a population of one thousand or less may, in lieu of publishing the charter in a newspaper, distribute copies of the charter door-to-door and have them posted and available at prominent locations in the city. In the event a city does not publish the charter in a newspaper, it must still publish a notice of the election.

One copy of the charter ratified and approved must be filed with the secretary of state and one with the auditor of the city to remain as a part of its permanent records.

        N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 precluded the City of Fargo, North Dakota, a home rule city, from imposing fees for noncriminal traffic offenses that exceeded the limits set forth for equivalent violations in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-06, because N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 clearly and unambiguously precludes a home rule city from superseding criminal or noncriminal offenses defined by State law, when a penalty that exceeds the limits delineated by equivalent State law supersedes State law; the word “offense” rather than the word “crimes” is used in the text of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05, and an “offense” under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 includes noncriminal, as well as criminal offenses.

        Imposition of a fine for violation of municipal ordinances was reversed and remanded for entry of an order vacating the decision because the Fargo Administrative Enforcement Board had no statutory authority to adjudicate the owner’s alleged violations of the municipal ordinances and its decision was void, when there was no authority for the creation of an administrative system for adjudication of alleged violations of ordinances or regulations enacted by the municipality as an alternative to municipal court and the responsibilities granted to the Board conflicted with N.D.C.C. § 40-18-01(1).

        The supersession provision in this section has limited and qualified application and does not provide that any and every ordinance a city may pass supersedes any state law in conflict therewith; supersession provision applies only to those powers set out in N.D.C.C. § 40-05.1-06, provided they are also included in the charter and implemented by ordinance.

        To permit a conclusion that an ordinance supersedes a state law, providing the charter and implementing ordinance requirements have been met, it is not only essential that the power given to the city by the legislature is clearly expressed or necessarily implied from the grant but also that it conflicts with the laws generally applicable to cities.

      <li id="t40c40-05.1s40-05.1-06ol14">
       To levy and collect an infrastructure fee. The fee must replace a general special assessment on all property for payment of infrastructure maintenance costs through a utility bill issued by a municipality.

        District court did not err in granting the city summary judgment on the rental house owner's claim that it did not have authority to charge a re-inspection fee where the International Property Maintenance Code (IPMC) provided for fees to carry out inspection responsibilities, the city had adopted the IPMC by reference, N.D.C.C. § 40-05.1-06(2) and Fargo, N.D., Municipal Code § 31.0102 authorized such fees, and the owner had not shown that the city's use of an inspector and need to be reimbursed the costs related to re-inspections was unreasonable.

        N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 precluded the City of Fargo, North Dakota, a home rule city, from imposing fees for noncriminal traffic offenses that exceeded the limits set forth for equivalent violations in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-06, because N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 clearly and unambiguously precludes a home rule city from superseding criminal or noncriminal offenses defined by State law, when a penalty that exceeds the limits delineated by equivalent State law supersedes State law; the word “offense” rather than the word “crimes” is used in the text of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05, and an “offense” under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 includes noncriminal, as well as criminal offenses.

        City’s power to provide compensation for its employees was not governed by N.D.C.C. § 40-05-01(69) because the city was a home rule city and had availed itself of the power to regulate employee compensation and supersede state law under N.D.C.C. § 40-05.1-06 by implementing its home rule charter compensation provision by ordinance; section 40-05-01(69) provided that a municipality had the power to consolidate existing pension plans, which the city did when it repealed the prior ordinances providing separate pension plans and enacted a new ordinance for a combined employee pension plan.

       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 40-05.1-06 authorized home rule cities to provide compensation for their employees, pension plans were compensation, and the city’s home rule charter and implementing ordinance met the requirements; the city had the authority to combine the police and city employee pension plans under its home rule charter, and the city’s ordinances relating to the pension plan superseded conflicting state law.

Amendments may be proposed by the governing body of the city or by petition of the number of electors provided in section 40-05.1-02 and submitted to the voters at the same election. The voters may at their option accept or reject any or all of the amendments by a majority vote of qualified electors voting on the question at the election. A proposal to repeal a home rule charter that has been adopted must likewise be submitted to the electors of the city as set forth in this section. One copy of a ratified amendment or a repeal of a home rule charter must be filed with the secretary of state and one with the city auditor. Upon proper filing of the amendment or repeal, the courts shall take judicial notice of the amendment or repeal.

    Term of office of council members — Staggered terms provided for in cities where other than ten council members elected.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Council members shall hold office for four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. Terms of council members must be arranged so that one-half of the council members in any city, as nearly as practicable, are elected in any one election. When a city first adopts the council form of government or changes the number of council members, or when a city that has adopted the commission system of government returns to the city council form of government as provided by section 40-04-08, the alternation of the terms of the council members must be perfected as follows: of the council members elected in each ward, the one receiving the greater number of votes shall serve until the fourth Tuesday in June following the second succeeding biennial election and the one receiving the lesser number of votes shall serve until the fourth Tuesday in June following the biennial election succeeding the council member’s election; if the city is not divided into wards, the one-half of the council members elected in the entire city receiving the greater number of votes shall serve until the fourth Tuesday in June following the second succeeding biennial election and the one-half of the council members elected in the entire city receiving the lesser number of votes shall serve until the fourth Tuesday in June following the biennial election succeeding their election. Whenever, for any reason, vacancies exist on the council which require an unexpired term to be filled by election, the unexpired term must be designated on the ballot separate from any other regular term or terms that may also appear on the ballot. Candidates seeking nomination to an unexpired term are required to indicate whether or not they are seeking a regular term of office or an unexpired term of office on their nominating petitions as set forth in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-21s40-21-07" target="_self">40-21-07.</a></cite>

Upon petition of five percent of the qualified electors of the ward, as determined by the total number of votes cast in that ward in the last city general election, the council shall call a special election to fill a vacancy occurring more than six months before the next city election, if the petition has been submitted within fifteen days and before four p.m. of the fifteenth day of the date of the vacancy or of the vacancy being filled by appointment. If the petition is mailed, it must be in the possession of the council or its representative before four p.m. on the fifteenth day after the vacancy occurs or after the vacancy was filled by appointment.

      If a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor, the city council may call a special city election to fill such vacancy for the unexpired term or may, after fifteen days from the date of such vacancy, elect one of its members to act as mayor. The member so elected shall possess all the rights and powers of the mayor until the next election and until a mayor is elected and qualified. Upon petition of five percent of the qualified electors, as determined by the total number of votes cast in the city in the last city general election, the council shall call a special election to fill a vacancy occurring more than six months prior to the next city election, provided such petition is submitted within fifteen days of the date of such vacancy. During the interim between the date when a vacancy occurs in the office of mayor and election and qualification of a successor, the president of the city council shall be the acting mayor.

        This section, requiring the mayor to report his reasons for removal to the city council, was not enacted for the benefit of the officer removed; rather, it is for the benefit of the city council, so that the members thereof might be apprised of the events occurring in city government.

       <p>
        A city maintenance person did not meet the criteria to be classified as an officer; therefore, the mayor was without lawful authority to terminate the city maintenance person’s employment without council approval because such authority was not expressly or impliedly conferred upon the mayor by this section, which grants power to remove officers, but not employees of the city.

    Election to determine question of retention of city manager plan — Procedure thereafter.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At any time after the city manager plan has been in force in any city for a period of five years or more, the governing body of the city may submit at any regular election the question of whether or not such plan shall be retained. If a petition signed by forty percent or more of the qualified electors of the city, as shown by the votes cast for the executive officer at the preceding city election, requesting the submission of such question is filed with the city auditor, the governing body shall submit such proposal to the qualified electors of the city at an election to be held within ninety days after the filing of such petition. The signatures to such petition need not be appended to a single paper, but each single paper so used shall clearly state the purpose of the petition at the top of the paper, and each signature shall have been placed thereon not more than ninety days prior to the date on which the petition is filed in the office of the city auditor. Upon each paper one of the qualified electors signing such petition shall, under oath before an officer competent to administer oaths, swear that that person witnessed the signing of each signature appearing on such paper and that each signature appearing upon such paper is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Each petition, in addition to the names of the signers, shall contain the name of the street and the number of the house in which each petitioner resides, the length of the petitioner’s residence in the state of North Dakota and in the city, and the date on which the petitioner signed the petition. Any petitioner shall be permitted to withdraw the petitioner’s name from a petition at any time prior to action by the governing body calling the election as provided herein. Such question shall not be submitted more than once in every five years. If a majority of the votes cast on the question at the election shall be against retaining the city manager plan, the city shall revert to the plan in force previous to the adoption of the city manager plan, and the provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to such city except after another compliance with its terms. The governing body shall fix the date, not less than three months nor more than six months after an election at which the majority vote on the question is against the retention of the city manager plan, when such plan shall cease to be operative in the municipality.

     <p>
      An ordinance or resolution adopted by the city council of a city operating under the council form of government is not enacted until the ordinance or resolution is approved by the mayor or passed over the mayor’s veto. An ordinance or resolution passed by the governing body of a city operating under the council form of government must be deposited in the office of the city auditor for the approval of the mayor. If the mayor approves the ordinance or resolution, the mayor shall sign the ordinance or resolution. An ordinance or resolution not approved by the mayor must be returned by the mayor with the mayor’s objections in writing to the next regular or special meeting of the council occurring not less than five days after the passage of the ordinance or resolution. The veto may extend to an entire ordinance or resolution or to any one or more items or appropriations contained in any ordinance or resolution making an appropriation. If a veto extends to only a part of an ordinance or resolution, the residue takes effect. If the mayor fails to return any ordinance or resolution with the mayor’s objections within the time specified in this section, the mayor is deemed to have approved the ordinance or resolution. Any veto of an ordinance or resolution may be overridden by the city council, if two-thirds of its members pass a motion to override the veto. Upon such action, the ordinance or resolution is effective notwithstanding the veto. The vote to pass an ordinance or resolution over the mayor’s veto must be taken by yeas and nays and entered in the journal.

The bond must be in an amount fixed by the governing body of the city. The bond of the auditor must be set by resolution of the governing body of the city at a regular meeting in June of each year in an amount at least equal to twenty-five percent of the average amount of money that has been subject to the auditor’s control during the preceding fiscal year, as determined by the total of the daily balances of the auditor for the calendar year divided by the figure three hundred or the sum of two hundred fifty thousand dollars whichever is least. All official bonds must be approved by the executive officer of the city and filed in the office of the city auditor. The bonds must conform to the law applicable to the bonds of state officers and employees except that no personal surety may be accepted on any bond. A city may not pay the premium on any bond except a bond written in the state bonding fund or a bond procured to replace a bond canceled by the state bonding fund. The governing body at any time may require new and additional bonds of any officer.

        The institution of second proceedings by a board of city commissioners to remove a city assessor after the district court declared the first proceedings null and void on certiorari does not deprive the commissioners of the right to have the validity of the first removal proceedings determined on appeal to the supreme court. State ex rel. Ness v. Board of City Comm'rs, 63 N.D. 33, 245 N.W. 887, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1932).

        Where a city official has been removed by the board of city commissioners, the only question that can be considered on certiorari is the question of the board’s jurisdiction. State ex rel.

    Municipal judge may enforce orders and judgments and punish for contempt.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipal judge may enforce due obedience to the court’s orders and judgments. The judge may fine or imprison for contempt committed in the judge’s presence while holding court, as well as for contempt of process issued, and of orders made by the judge. When an act or omission constituting a contempt in a municipal court is not committed in the presence of the municipal judge, an affidavit alleging the facts may be filed and a warrant of arrest thereupon may issue on which the person accused may be arrested and brought before the municipal judge immediately. The person must be given a reasonable opportunity to employ counsel and defend against the alleged contempt. After hearing the allegations and proofs, the municipal judge may discharge the person or adjudge the person guilty and may punish by fine or imprisonment or both. The fine in any case may not be more than one thousand five hundred dollars and the imprisonment may not be more than thirty days.

       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Dakota held that post-conviction relief under N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1 was not available in municipal courts in North Dakota, because municipal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction under N.D.C.C. § 40-18-14; whereas, the district courts have general jurisdiction under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.27.html#t27c27-05s27-05-06" target="_blank">27-05-06.</a></cite> Jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for post-conviction relief was designed to be vested in courts of general jurisdiction.

      An appeal may be taken to the district court from a judgment of conviction or order deferring imposition of sentence in a municipal court in accordance with the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure. An appeal is perfected by notice of appeal. A perfected appeal to the district court transfers the action to such district court for trial anew. On all appeals from a determination in a municipal court, the district court shall take judicial notice of all of the ordinances of the city. No filing fee may be required in district court for the filing of an appeal from a judgment of conviction for the violation of a municipal ordinance. Expenses necessary for the adequate defense of a needy person in an appeal to district court from a judgment of conviction for the violation of a municipal ordinance, as approved by the presiding district judge, must be paid by the city wherein the alleged offense took place.

        Evidence of a failure to stop in the presence of police vehicle emergency lights and siren supports by a preponderance of the evidence the finding that the failure to stop was an endeavor to avoid arrest for purposes of N.D.C.C. 40-20-05(2).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the observation and stop of defendant’s vehicle occurred outside his geographical jurisdiction as the Casselton Chief of Police, the chief was vested with jurisdiction under section 44-08-20(3) by a highway patrolman’s request for assistance in stopping the suspect’s vehicle. State v. Graven, 530 N.W.2d 328, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution of defendant for driving under the influence, the district court erred in denying defendant’s suppression motion, where the record lacked sufficient competent evidence to establish a police officer stopped defendant’s vehicle within the officer’s geographical jurisdiction. There was no evidence that the officer was in hot pursuit of the vehicle driven by defendant as that term was defined by N.D.C.C. § 40-20-05(2), nor was there evidence that the officer was assisting other law enforcement officers at the time he stopped the vehicle.
   State v. Demars, 2007 ND 145, 738 N.W.2d 486, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient competent evidence supported the district court's finding that hot pursuit permitted a University of North Dakota police officer to extend his capacity and authority to stop and arrest defendant. State v. Wilkie, 2017 ND 142, 895 N.W.2d 742, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        The whole subject of creating election districts and locating the polling places where the residents of the district may vote is with the legislature, and it may lawfully delegate this power to local authorities.

        The good-faith intent of a voter to make a place his home for all purposes is an essential element entering into the determination of the question of residence. Nelson v. Gass, 27 N.D. 357, 146 N.W. 537, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1914).

        The place of one’s residence for the purpose of voting is where he has his established home, the place where he is habitually present and to which he intends to return when he departs. Nelson v. Gass, 27 N.D. 357, 146 N.W. 537, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1914).

      A candidate for any public office in an incorporated city may be nominated by filing with the city auditor, before four p.m. on the sixty-fourth day before the holding of the election, a petition signed by not less than ten percent of the number of qualified electors who voted for that office in the last city election. A candidate shall also file a statement of interests as required by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16.1c16.1-09s16.1-09-02" target="_blank">16.1-09-02.</a></cite> If multiple candidates were elected to the office at the preceding city election at which the office was voted upon, the number of signatures must equal at least ten percent of the total votes cast for all candidates divided by the number of candidates that were to be elected to that office at that election. Qualified electors who sign a petition must reside within the ward or precinct in and for which that officer is to be elected, if the election is by wards, or within the corporate limits of the city, if the officer is elected at large. In cities operating under the commission system of government the required petition may be signed by the qualified electors at large residing within the city. If a petition is mailed, it must be in the possession of the city auditor before four p.m. on the sixty-fourth day before the holding of the election. However, no more than three hundred signatures may be required and the signatures may be on separate sheets of paper. Petitions must meet the specifications of nominating petitions pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16.1c16.1-11s16.1-11-16" target="_blank">16.1-11-16.</a></cite> If a city election is not combined with a state or county election according to section 40-21-02, a candidate may be nominated by filing the required petition with the city auditor before four p.m. on the sixty-fourth day before the holding of the election. A candidate may withdraw the candidate’s nominating petition at any time before the applicable deadlines for filing nominating petitions provided for in this section. Nominating petitions required by this section may not be circulated or signed prior to January first preceding the election. Any signatures to a nominating petition obtained before that date may not be counted. A nominating petition for a special election may not be circulated or signed more than thirty days before the time when a petition for a special election must be filed. A candidate for city council may run for either the office of mayor or council member but not both in the same election. A candidate for the city commission may run for either the office of city commissioner or the office of president of the board of city commissioners but not both in the same election. A candidate may run for only one office in a city at any given election.

    Election districts in council cities — Division and consolidation by ordinance — Ballots to be kept separate by wards.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each city operating under the council form of government in which council members are elected at large constitutes an election district or voting precinct, and in all other cities each ward constitutes an election district or voting precinct. Whenever the number of electors in any two or more contiguous wards does not exceed one hundred as determined by the number of votes cast at the last city election, the council, by ordinance, may consolidate those two or more wards into one precinct for voting purposes. In any city containing less than four hundred electors as determined by the number of votes cast at the last city election, the council, by ordinance, may consolidate all the wards of the city into one precinct for voting purposes. An ordinance dividing or consolidating wards must be passed and takes effect before the time of giving notice of the election. Wards and precincts established under this section constitute election districts for all state, county, and city elections. In city elections, separate ballot boxes and pollbooks must be provided and kept for each precinct. The terms “wards”, “precincts”, and “election districts” have the same meaning except where two or more wards are consolidated into one precinct for voting purposes or where one ward is divided into more than one precinct for voting purposes. This section does not prohibit the use of one building as the election polling place for more than one ward or the installation of electronic voting systems from separate wards in one building.

        It is within the power of the assembly of a state to create special taxing districts, and to charge the cost of a local improvement to the property in such districts, either according to valuation or to superficial area or frontage.

        The fact that an assessment was spread uniformly over a large area is not conclusive that it was arbitrarily made or that there was no attempt to distribute the burden in proportion to the benefits. Minneapolis, St. Paul &amp; Sault Ste. Marie Ry. v. City of Minot, 51 N.D. 313, 199 N.W. 875, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that the burden of the cost of a public improvement is divided between various properties in proportion to the front footage is not in itself proof of an arbitrary assessment or one made regardless of benefits.

        Improvements may benefit property although the full fruition of such benefit is postponed or the present use of the property is of such character as not to be materially affected by such improvements.

       <p>
        It was error to conclude N.D.C.C. § 40-22-15 gave a property owner no right to protest a city's creation of an improvement district because (1) the district included street repairs, utilities and other items not included in the description of a water or sewer improvement under N.D.C.C. § 40-22-01(1), and (2) it was unknown if the other repairs were incidental to water and sewer repairs, so it could not be concluded with certainty that the property owner's complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

    Restoration of property damaged in flood control or during a declared disaster or emergency — Special assessments for costs.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When any city has constructed any temporary emergency flood control protection devices or works to protect property located within a portion of a city from flood damage or expended funds for the protection of the city from flood or other peril under chapter 37-17.1 or otherwise, the city may maintain and remove material used in the construction of the temporary emergency flood control protection devices or works and the repair damages to land, buildings, or personal property caused by the operation of its equipment upon the property while in the process of installing or removing the temporary emergency flood protection systems. The city may create by resolution of its governing board a special assessment district encompassing the protected area. Special assessments against the property within the district must be imposed to cover the costs incurred by the city in constructing and maintaining the emergency flood protection devices or works and in removing the material used and in repairing the damages caused by the operation of equipment while installing or removing the temporary emergency flood protection systems. The amount to be assessed must be established by a resolution adopted by the governing board. Special assessments against any property in the district must be determined and made in the same manner as is provided for improvements by special assessments to the extent consistent herewith, and the certification and collection, including lien provisions, applicable to other special assessments are applicable hereto. Provided, however, that the provisions of sections 40-22-15, 40-22-17, and 40-22-18, relating to a resolution of necessity and protests against special assessments, sections 40-22-10, 40-22-11, and 40-22-29, relating to engineers’ reports, plans, and estimates, and section 40-22-19, relating to contract proposals, do not apply to special assessment districts created under this section.

        Special assessment commission determined that the improvements benefited the owner’s properties in the amount assessed to them under the city’s policy, and the assessments did not exceed the benefits; the city did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably in determining the benefits and assessments to the owner’s properties. Despite the city’s difficulty in explaining the determination of benefits, the assessments satisfied the statute. Holter v.

         Liability of City for Damages.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In constructing a sewer system, a city acts in its governmental capacity and the taking or damaging of private property occasioned thereby is a taking or damaging for public use and, where the right to take is acquired by contract, the right of the property owner to damages is satisfied by the contract and a later purchaser of the property has no right to damages arising from overflow of the sewer. Hamilton v. Bismarck, 71 N.D. 321, 300 N.W. 631, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        By casting its sewage into a river without proper and sufficient treatment over a long period of time, a city violates its duty and cannot rely on its immunity to protect it from responding in damages. Messer v. Dickinson, 71 N.D. 568, 3 N.W.2d 241, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 92</cite> (N.D. 1942); Kinnischtzke v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although a city has the legislative authority to empty its sewage into a river, that authority is limited by the duty resting upon the city to exercise its authority in a reasonable manner and to take all reasonable precautions against damaging private property. Messer v. Dickinson, 71 N.D. 568, 3 N.W.2d 241, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 92</cite> (N.D. 1942); Conlon v. City of Dickinson, 72 N.D. 190, 5 N.W.2d 411, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

     <p>
      When it is necessary to conduct the sewage of a municipality beyond the municipal limits or to acquire a supply of water beyond such limits and to construct mains or aqueducts to conduct such water to the municipal limits, the governing body, by grant, purchase, or condemnation proceedings, may acquire private property over which to construct the sewer, or upon and over which to establish facilities for obtaining and storing such water supply and aqueducts or mains for conducting the same to the corporate limits. Public property may likewise be acquired for such purposes by grant or purchase from the government or public corporation owning the same. The cost of acquiring such property and of building such sewer or other facilities upon or over the property may be included in the cost of construction or acquisition of a municipal waterworks or sewerage system and in the special assessments levied therefor, or the entirety of such a project may be completed as an improvement to an existing waterworks or sewage system and special assessments may be levied therefor in accordance with the provisions of this title.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever property required to make any improvement authorized by this chapter is to be taken by condemnation proceedings, the court, upon request by resolution of the governing body of the municipality making such improvement, shall call a special term of court for the trial of the proceedings and may summon a jury for the trial whenever necessary. The proceedings shall be instituted and prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 32-15, except that when the interest sought to be acquired is a right of way for the opening, laying out, widening, or enlargement of any street, highway, avenue, boulevard, or alley in the municipality, or for the laying of any main, pipe, ditch, canal, aqueduct, or flume for conducting water, storm water, or sewage, whether within or without the municipality, the municipality may make an offer to purchase the right of way and may deposit the amount of the offer with the clerk of the district court of the county wherein the right of way is located, and may thereupon take possession of the right of way forthwith. The offer shall be made by resolution of the governing body of the municipality, a copy of which shall be attached to the complaint filed with said clerk of court in accordance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-15s32-15-18" target="_blank">32-15-18.</a></cite> The clerk shall immediately notify the owner or owners of the land wherein the right of way is located of the deposit, by causing a notice to be appended to the summons when served and published in said proceedings as provided in the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure, stating the amount deposited or agreed in the resolution to be deposited. The owner may thereupon appeal to the court by filing an answer to the complaint in the manner provided in the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure, and may have a jury trial, unless a jury be waived, to determine the damages. However, upon due proof of the service of said notice and summons and upon deposit of the aggregate sum agreed in said resolution, the court may without further notice make and enter an order determining the municipality to be entitled to take immediate possession of the right of way. If under laws of the United States proceedings for the acquisition of any right of way are required to be instituted in or removed to a federal court, the proceedings may be taken in that court in the same manner and with the same effect as provided in this section and the clerk of the district court of the county in which the right of way is located shall perform any and all of the duties set forth in this section, if directed to do so by the federal court. The proceedings shall be determined as speedily as practicable. An appeal from a judgment in the condemnation proceedings shall be taken within sixty days after the entry of the judgment, and the appeal shall be given preference by the supreme court over all other civil cases except election contests. No final judgment in the condemnation proceedings awarding damages to property used by a municipality for street, sewer, or other purposes shall be vacated or set aside if the municipality shall pay to the defendant, or shall pay into court for the defendant, in cash, the amount so awarded. The municipality may levy special assessments to pay all or any part of the judgment and at the time of the next annual tax levy may levy a general tax for the payment of the part of the judgment as is not to be paid by special assessment. For the purpose of providing funds for the payment of the judgment, or for the deposit of the amount offered for purchase of a right of way as provided above, the municipality may issue warrants on the fund of the improvement district as provided in section 40-24-19, in anticipation of the levy and collection of special assessments and of any taxes or revenues to be appropriated to the fund in accordance with the provisions of this title. The warrants may be issued upon the commencement of the condemnation proceedings or at any time thereafter. Upon the failure of the municipality to make payment in accordance with this section, the judgment in the condemnation proceedings may be vacated.

     <p>
      Any municipality in this state, through its governing body, may enter into an agreement with any state agency, the board of county commissioners, or water resource board of the county in which the municipality is located, or a joint water resource board which jurisdiction includes the municipality, or any federal agency, or any combination thereof, for the improvement of streets, sewers, water mains, flood control projects, or of any of such facilities, under the terms of which the contract for such work is to be let by the state agency, the board of county commissioners, water resource board, joint water resource board, the federal agency, or any combination thereof, and for this purpose may create a special improvement district or districts. No such agreement may be entered into until and unless the governing body certifies that it has obtained authority in accordance with this section to issue improvement warrants to finance the amount that the municipality will be obligated to pay thereunder, over and above the amount of any bonds which have been voted and any other funds which are on hand and properly available for such purpose. If any portion of the cost is to be paid by the levy of special assessments, the governing body shall by resolution declare the necessity of the improvement, setting forth its general nature, the approximate amount or fraction of the cost which the municipality will be obligated to pay under the agreement, and the fact that this amount, or such lesser amount as the governing body may specify, is proposed to be paid by the levy of special assessments upon property determined to be benefited by the improvement. Any portion of the cost for which the municipality is obligated and which is not assessed upon benefited property or paid from other funds may be agreed to be paid by general taxation of all the taxable property in the municipality, if approval for the incurring of such debt is obtained and provision for the payment thereof is made in accordance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-24s40-24-10" target="_self">40-24-10.</a></cite> The resolution of necessity must be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in the official newspaper of the municipality and protests may be filed and their sufficiency to bar the improvement must be determined in accordance with sections 40-22-16 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-22s40-22-18" target="_self">40-22-18.</a></cite> However, if under the terms of the resolution of necessity the portion of the cost of the project to be assessed upon benefited property does not exceed twenty-five percent of the total cost to be paid by the state agency, county, water resource board, joint water resource board, federal agency, and municipality, written protests by the owners of seventy-five percent of the property liable to be assessed for the improvement shall be required to bar further proceedings with reference thereto. At any time after the period for filing protests has expired and the protests filed, if any, have been heard and determined to be insufficient, the governing body may issue warrants on the fund of the improvement in the total amount for which the municipality is obligated under the agreement, and may cause to be certified to the special assessment commission that portion of the cost to be borne by the property owners within the district, and the assessment of such amount may be made and such warrants may be issued as in other cases provided for in chapters 40-23 and 40-24.

     <p>
      For the purpose of making an improvement project of one of the types specified in section 40-22-01 and defraying the cost thereof by special assessments, a municipality may create water districts, sewer districts, water and sewer districts, street improvement districts, boulevard improvement districts, flood protection districts, and parking districts, and may extend any such district when necessary. The appropriate special improvement district may be created by ordinance or resolution. The district shall be designated by a name appropriate to the type of improvement for the making of which it is created, and by a number distinguishing it from other improvement districts. Nothing herein, however, shall prevent a municipality from making and financing any improvement and levying special assessments therefor under any alternate procedure set forth in this title.

        In creation of special assessment district to provide funds for highway overpass, inclusion of property which was to be “specially benefited” from overpass did not create an arbitrary classification and neither unreasonably nor invidiously discriminated against those property owners included in the district; exclusion of property in urban renewal area adjacent to proposed overpass did not invalidate special assessment district.

        Before a public improvement which is to be paid for by special assessments may be undertaken, an improvement district must be created as a jurisdictional prerequisite. Merchants Nat'l Bank v.

        The statutes granting cities the power to widen, pave, and otherwise improve streets and avenues are mandatory and not merely directory.

      Any improvement district created by a municipality may embrace two or more separate property areas. Each improvement district shall be of such size and form as to include all properties which in the judgment of the governing body, after consultation with the engineer planning the improvement, will be benefited by the construction of the improvement project which is proposed to be made in or for such district, or by any portion or portions of such project. A single district may be created for an improvement of the type specified in any one of the subsections of section 40-22-01, notwithstanding any lack of uniformity among the types, items, or quantities of work and materials to be used at particular locations throughout the district. The jurisdiction of a municipality to make, finance, and assess the cost of any improvement project shall not be impaired by any lack of commonness, unity, or singleness of the location, purpose, or character of the improvement, or by the fact that any one or more of the properties included in the district is subsequently determined not to be benefited by the improvement, or by a particular portion thereof, and is not assessed therefor. There may be omitted from a water or sewer district, in the discretion of the governing body, properties within the corporate limits which are benefited by the improvement therein but do not abut upon a water or sewer main, without prejudice to the right and power of the municipality subsequently to assess such properties to the extent and in the manner permitted by law. The governing body may by resolution enlarge an improvement district in which an improvement is proposed or under construction upon receipt of a petition therefor signed by the owners of three-fourths of the area to be added to the district.

        Notice by publication of resolution of necessity for establishment of parking improvement district did not deprive property owners of constitutional rights. Fisher v. Minot, 188 N.W.2d 745, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Publication of resolution declaring necessity for formation of special assessment district for parking improvement, was sufficient under due process clause; personal service on property owners within district was not necessary since all property affected was within two blocks of the improvement and owners had actual knowledge of the proposed improvement. Patterson v. Bismarck, 212 N.W.2d 374, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1973).

        Because the landowners did not commence their action to invalidate assessments on the grounds that the city had not complied with the notice requirements of N.D.C.C. § 40-22-15 when creating an improvement district within 30 days of the adoption of the resolution awarding the sale of warrants, N.D.C.C. § 40-22-43 barred the action unless the proceedings violated a constitutional limitation or restriction.

       <p>
        The foundation of the power to lay a special assessment for a local improvement of any character, including the improvement of a city street, is the benefit which the object of the assessment confers on the owner of the abutting property, or the owners of property in the assessment district, which is different from the general benefit which the owners enjoy in common with other inhabitants or citizens of the municipal corporation.

       <p>
        It was error to conclude N.D.C.C. § 40-22-15 gave a property owner no right to protest a city's creation of an improvement district because (1) the district included street repairs, utilities and other items not included in the description of a water or sewer improvement under N.D.C.C. § 40-22-01(1), and (2) it was unknown if the other repairs were incidental to water and sewer repairs, so it could not be concluded with certainty that the property owner's complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

    Sewer or water improvements and parking lots in municipalities may be paid for by service charges.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipality constructing a sewer or water improvement or a parking lot under the special assessment method may resolve in the resolution or ordinance required by section 40-22-08 in the case of a sewer or water improvement, or in the resolution required by section 40-22-15 in the case of a parking lot, that a portion of the cost of the improvement shall be raised by service charges for the use of the improvement, and of the utility or parking system of which it forms a part. If the municipality so resolves, it may determine, in its resolutions, ordinances, and other proceedings relating to the levying of special assessments and the issuing of warrants to pay the cost of such improvement, that a specified portion or all of such cost shall be assessed specially against any property specially benefited and may cause to be assessed only the portion so determined. In such event the entire remainder of such cost, including interest as well as principal of any warrants issued, over and above the amount of special assessments actually collected and received from time to time in the fund of the improvement district, plus any general taxes pledged in accordance with section 40-24-10 and similarly collected and received, shall be paid from the net revenues derived from said service charges; provided, that nothing herein shall affect the power and duty of the governing body to levy a tax for the payment of a deficiency in the improvement district fund at the times and under the conditions set forth in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-26s40-26-08" target="_self">40-26-08.</a></cite> All of the applicable provisions of this title relating to special assessments shall be applicable to such improvements except as to the portion of the cost thereof resolved or ordained to be paid by service charges. The governing body of the municipality shall provide for the establishment, imposition, and collection of service charges for the services furnished by such improvement and the utility or parking system of which it forms a part, and in connection therewith it shall have all the rights and powers respecting such service charges as it would have with respect to like matters if such improvement were made in accordance with chapter 40-35. The net revenues derived from the imposition and collection of such service charges, or such portion thereof as shall be determined by the governing body in said resolutions and ordinances, shall be paid into the appropriate improvement district funds created pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-24s40-24-18" target="_self">40-24-18.</a></cite> Such revenues when collected shall be used and applied in the same manner as moneys paid into such funds from the collection of special assessments. In its resolutions and ordinances, the governing body of any municipality issuing warrants to finance any such improvement may establish an assessment reserve in the fund of the improvement district, to which it may appropriate net revenues of the utility or system from time to time received in excess of amounts required, with special assessments and taxes then on hand, to meet the principal and interest next due on such warrants. Prior to November first of any year, the governing body may by resolution determine the proportion which the amount then on hand in said assessment reserve, and irrevocably appropriated to the payment of said warrant, bears to the aggregate amount of the installment of the special assessments and taxes levied for the improvement which is payable in the following year, including interest thereon, and the governing body may direct the county auditor to reduce, by not more than a proportionate amount, the total of such installment and interest which would otherwise be placed upon the tax list of the municipality for the current year, against each lot and tract of land assessed or taxed for the improvement. If such installment of the special assessment on any property has been prepaid, the governing body may direct the city auditor to refund, out of the assessment reserve, to the owner of the property at the time of such refund as indicated in the records of the recorder of the county, a sum not exceeding a similar proportion of the principal amount of such installment, excluding interest.

        Where property owners failed to file written protests to action of city board of commissioners in creating an improvement district, they were bound thereby and the board’s action creating such district was conclusive. Reed v. Langdon, 78 N.D. 991, 54 N.W.2d 148, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1952).

        When plaintiff companies failed to protest the creation of a special improvement district, they were unable to challenge the failure to include other nearby properties in the district; the companies’ action was properly dismissed against the city after the city’s assessment of funds against the companies for a street improvement project.

       <p>
        It was error to conclude N.D.C.C. § 40-22-15 gave a property owner no right to protest a city's creation of an improvement district because (1) the district included street repairs, utilities and other items not included in the description of a water or sewer improvement under N.D.C.C. § 40-22-01(1), and (2) it was unknown if the other repairs were incidental to water and sewer repairs, so it could not be concluded with certainty that the property owner's complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

      If the governing body finds the protests to contain the names of the owners of a majority of the area of the property included within the improvement district, the protests shall be a bar against proceeding with any special assessment for the improvement project. However, the protests do not bar proceeding with the improvement project described in the plans and specifications if the governing body funds the project with funds other than special assessments. If the governing body finds the protests to contain the names of the owners of a majority of any separate property area included within the district, the protests shall be a bar against proceeding with special assessments to be assessed in whole or in part upon property within the area, but shall not bar against proceeding with the improvement project or assessing the cost thereof against other areas within the district, unless the protests represent a majority of the area of the entire district. If the protests represent a majority of the area of the entire district, the protests bar any special assessment for the improvement project. Property owned by a political subdivision is not included when determining whether the protests contain the names of the owners of a majority of the area included within the improvement district or a separate property area unless the political subdivision filed a protest.

        The certificate of the city engineer that work has been completed is essential before the city can levy assessments against individual property for the payment of the cost of the improvement. Baker v. Lamoure, 21 N.D. 140, 129 N.W. 464, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 1910).

        Where contract for municipal improvements specifically provided that the project engineer would supervise the work and would see that such work was done according to the contract provisions, the certificate of the engineer approving the work and the manner of performance and the action of the city in accepting such certificate of approval were conclusive on the parties in the absence of fraud, collusion, or such gross mistake as would imply bad faith on the part of the engineer.

     <p>
      If the contractor to whom a contract is let properly performs the work therein designated, the governing body, at least once in each calendar month during the continuance of such contract work, shall meet, receive, and consider estimates furnished by the agent, engineer, or architect acting for the municipality or if not so furnished, then by the contractor, and shall allow such estimates in an amount of the estimated value of the labor and material furnished upon such contract, and of the material then upon the ground for use in such contract, subject to retentions equal to ten percent of each estimate presented until such time as the project is fifty percent completed, with no further retainage on estimates during the continuance of the contract. The governing body may, however, upon completion of ninety-five percent of the contract according to the estimates, pay to the contractor ninety-five percent of the amount retained from previous estimates. Any amount retained after ninety-five percent completion of the contract shall be paid to the contractor in such amounts and at such times as are approved by the municipality, upon estimates by its agent, engineer, or architect or the contractor, with final payment of all moneys due to the contractor to be made immediately following completion and acceptance of the project. The governing body, immediately after considering and allowing any such estimate, shall certify and forward the same to the city auditor or other official having the power to draw warrants, who forthwith shall draw a warrant upon the proper fund and transmit the same promptly to the contractor entitled thereto. In case the governing body shall fail or neglect to receive and allow such estimate or certify any estimate or final payment upon completion and acceptance or the proper officer required to issue such warrant shall fail or neglect to issue a warrant as provided herein, for a period of more than thirty days from the date of such estimate or completion date, then said estimate or final payment, together with any retainage properly payable, shall draw interest from its date at the rate per annum of two percentage points below the Bank of North Dakota prime interest rate as set thirty days from the date of such estimate or completion date until the issuance of a proper warrant therefor. Such interest shall be computed and added to the face of said estimate, final payment, or retainage by the officer required to issue such warrant, shall be included in the warrant when drawn, and shall be charged to the fund from which payment for the improvement is to be made. On the amounts of estimates retained, as provided herein, the governing board, authorized committee, or public body in charge of such work may invest or deposit the retained amounts in any financial association or institution in North Dakota earning interest or dividends for the benefit of the contractor. Any amounts so invested or deposited shall remain in the name of the governing board, authorized committee, or public body in charge of such work until final payment of all money due to the contractor is to be made. Further, no contractor shall use such account in any manner whatsoever until released and received by the contractor upon completion of the contract.

      The provisions of this chapter relating to water mains and waterworks apply only to municipalities that own or contemplate owning a system of waterworks and water mains. In case of the purchase of a waterworks system or of a sewage treatment or disposal plant or of a system of sewers, either by eminent domain proceedings subject to chapter 32-15, or otherwise, a municipality may create improvement districts, direct the preparation of plans and specifications, adopt a resolution declaring the purchase of such facilities necessary, and take all other proceedings prescribed by this chapter which would be taken in case of the construction of such facilities by the municipality itself for the purpose of defraying the cost thereof by special assessment of the property benefited thereby. The property benefited may be specially assessed for the purchase of such facilities, either separately or as a part of a new system, the same as if said facilities were constructed entirely anew.

    Discontinuance of municipal parking lots.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of a municipality may, if it deems it in the best interests of the municipality, discontinue the operation of a municipal parking lot when there exists a higher and better use for the property. If any portion of the cost of such parking lot has been paid for by special assessment, the governing body shall, prior to making any determination to discontinue, hold a public hearing concerning the continuance or discontinuance of such parking lot. The governing body shall cause to be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in the official newspaper of the municipality a notice of the time when and the place where the governing body will meet to conduct the hearing required by this section. If the governing body, after public hearing, determines that the parking lot may be put to a higher and better use, the governing body is hereby authorized to take the necessary steps to effectuate that use. For this purpose, the governing body is authorized to, but not limited to, enter into and complete negotiations for the sale of the parking lot in question.

      Whenever any portion of the cost of a parking lot which is to be discontinued has been paid for by special assessment, the useful life of the parking lot shall be determined by the governing body. If the period of time determined to be the useful life of the parking lot has not completely elapsed, the governing body of the municipality shall direct the cancellation of uncollected installments of special assessments previously levied for the same improvement, and the refund of installments paid, plus interest calculated at four and one-half percent per annum on the refunded prepaid installments, from the general fund of the municipality to the extent determined by it to be necessary to make the original assessments and the subsequent assessments bear as nearly as possible the same relation to the total benefits derived from the improvement by the respective properties assessed.

     <p>
      For an improvement project under section 40-22.1-01 and defraying the costs of the project by special assessments, a municipality may create and alter a business improvement district by ordinance or resolution. The governing body of the municipality shall designate the district by an appropriate name and by a number distinguishing it from other improvement districts. A municipality may make and finance any improvement and levy special assessments for the improvement under any alternate procedure in this title. If the proposal for creation of an improvement project under this chapter is made by any person, group, or entity that is not an officer, board, or agency of the municipality, the person, group, or entity shall file a bond or other sufficient security, payable to the municipality, to defray all costs incurred if the improvement project is later barred under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-22.1s40-22.1-08" target="_self">40-22.1-08.</a></cite> The bond or other sufficient security must be filed with the city auditor prior to the initiation of any further proceedings under this chapter. The governing body of the municipality shall determine the amount and form of the bond or other sufficient security.

     <p>
      Any business improvement district created by a municipality may embrace two or more separate property areas. A business improvement district must include all properties which in the judgment of the governing body, after consultation with the city auditor or city auditor’s designee planning the improvement, will be benefited by the creation of all or a portion of the business improvement project. A district may be created without uniformity among the types, items, or quantities of work and materials to be used at particular locations throughout the district. The jurisdiction of a municipality to make, finance, and assess the cost of any improvement project may not be impaired by any lack of commonness, unity, or singleness of the location, purpose, or character of the improvement, or by the fact that any one or more of the properties included in the district is subsequently determined not to be benefited by the improvement, or by a particular portion of the improvement. Upon receipt of a petition signed by the owners of three-fourths of the area to be added to a business improvement district in which an improvement is proposed or created, the governing body may enlarge the district. Any district created under this chapter shall include only property devoted, in whole or in part, to commercial or business use.

        A special assessment commission is in essence a legislative tribunal created by legislative authority for the purpose of (1) determining the benefits accruing to the several tracts of land in an improvement district by reason of the construction of an improvement and (2) assessing the costs and expenses thereof against each tract in proportion to the benefit received.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The foundation of the power to lay a special assessment for a local improvement of any character, including the improvement of a city street, is the benefit which the object of the assessment confers on the owner of the abutting property, or the owners of property in the assessment district, which is different from the general benefit which the owners enjoy in common with other inhabitants or citizens of the municipal corporation. Murphy v. Bismarck, 109 N.W.2d 635, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1961).

      At any time after the contract and bond for any work for which a special assessment is required have been executed and approved by the governing body of the municipality and the total cost of such work shall have been estimated as nearly as practicable, the governing body may direct assessments to be levied for the payment of all or any part of such cost, and the city auditor shall notify the chairman of the special assessment commission and shall certify to the chairman the items of the total cost thereof so far as the same have been ascertained. The chairman immediately shall call a meeting of the commission, which shall proceed as expeditiously as possible to make and return the special assessment as provided in this chapter. The total cost of the improvement which may be certified to the assessment commission shall include the estimated construction cost under the terms of the contract, a reasonable allowance as determined by the governing body for cost of extra work which may be authorized under the plans and specifications, engineering, fiscal agent’s and attorney’s fees for any services in connection with the authorization and financing of the improvement, cost of publication of required notices and printing of improvement warrants, and all expenses incurred in the making of the improvement and levy of assessments therefor. If any error is made in estimating the cost, the governing body may direct a supplemental assessment to be made as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-26s40-26-02" target="_self">40-26-02.</a></cite>

        “Construction interest” is a proper part of the expense of improvement within the terms of the statute. It is that sum estimated for the payment of interest on special assessment warrants sold to defray the cost of an improvement from the time of sale until special assessments become due and payable and begin to draw interest.

The governing body, by resolution adopted at any time before or after the work has been commenced, may specify what part of the improvements shall constitute a separate section or work unit, and upon completion of the work in one or more of such separate sections or work units, the special assessments may be made in the same manner and with the same force and effect as if all of the work in the entire improvement district had been completed. Failure for any reason to complete the work in any remaining separate section or work unit included within such improvement district shall not affect the validity of the special assessments made or the special assessment warrants issued for the work completed.

    Determination of special assessments by commission — Political subdivisions not exempt.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the commission makes any special assessment, the commission shall determine the particular lots and parcels of land which, in the opinion of the commission, will be especially benefited by the construction of the work for which the assessment is to be made. The commission shall determine the amount in which each of the lots and parcels of land will be especially benefited by the construction of the work for which such special assessment is to be made, and shall assess against each of such lots and parcels of land such sum, not exceeding the benefits, as is necessary to pay its just proportion of the total cost of such work, or of the part thereof which is to be paid by special assessment, including all expenses incurred in making such assessment and publishing necessary notices with reference thereto and the per diem of the commission. However, as an alternative to the procedure provided in this section, the special assessment commission may, in its discretion, determine and allocate the cost of special assessments in accordance with the method provided for in chapter 40-23.1. Property owned by a nonprofit entity and used exclusively as a cemetery is exempt from collection of special assessments for benefits conferred under this title and the city in which such property is located shall provide for the payment of special assessments, installments, and interest against such property by the levy of taxes according to law or by payment from other funds available to the city which are derived from sources other than special assessments. Benefited property belonging to counties, cities, school districts, park districts, and townships is not exempt from such assessment, and such public corporations whose property is so assessed shall provide for the payment of such assessments, installments thereof and interest thereon, by the levy of taxes according to law. Nothing in this section may be deemed to amend other provisions of law with reference to the levy of assessments on property sold for delinquent taxes.

        Special Assessment Commission did not abuse its discretion in choosing the method of assessment, the Special Assessment Commission determined the benefit to each property from the improvements and the method used for determining the special assessments was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.

        Special assessment commission determined that the improvements benefited the owner’s properties in the amount assessed to them under the city’s policy, and the assessments did not exceed the benefits; the city did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably in determining the benefits and assessments to the owner’s properties. Despite the city’s difficulty in explaining the determination of benefits, the assessments satisfied the statute. Holter v.

        District court properly dismissed an owner’s appeal of a board of city commissioners’ decision to specially assess her property for street improvements because the assessments to the owner’s properties satisfied the statutory requirements since the city assessed properties benefited by the street improvements on the basis of linear feet, and, while the findings by the special assessment commission on the amount of the benefit might be somewhat conclusory, the amount of the benefit was determined to be less than the total cost and was determined to be a just proportion of the total cost based on the city’s formula. 2020 ND 202, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        When a special assessment commission made an assessment against a property for a special flood-improvement district, the commission did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably because, even though the property’s owner could plan to continue farming the property, the property would benefit from the improvement district, and the special benefit received would not be exceeded by the assessment.

       <p>
        The commission properly exercised its authority and discretion in choosing to employ a “water use” method of assessment for improvements to the sewer system and the “water use” method was a fair, just, and equitable method of determining benefits, where there was a direct relationship between water use and the size of the improvement facilities. Although it may have been a somewhat novel method of assessing benefits, it appeared undeniable that water use did have a direct relationship to the size and capacity of sewerage facilities needed.

        Although evidence that the landowners had in fact received the benefits attributed to them was not overwhelming, where the water improvement enhanced fire protection and facilitated moderate commercial and residential growth, the city had received requests to develop some of the landowners’ property, and the old water system retarded city growth, these facts, combined with the presumption that assessments are valid, supported assessments on undeveloped property at approximately 43 percent of the rate of developed property, and the taxing authorities did not act arbitrarily, oppressively or unreasonably.

      Any property that was outside the corporate limits of the municipality at the time of contracting for an improvement, which is benefited by the improvement and is subsequently annexed to the municipality, may be assessed for the improvement subject to the same conditions and by the same procedure as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-23s40-23-18" target="_self">40-23-18.</a></cite> The property that is benefited may also be assessed for any improvement, within or outside the corporate limits, which is determined by the governing body and the special assessment commission to benefit property that was outside the corporate limits at the time of contracting for the improvement, whether or not an improvement district was previously created for the improvement. For this purpose, the governing body may create one or more improvement districts comprising all or part of the annexed territory. The governing body may provide for the levy of special assessments upon such property in the manner provided in this title, but may dispense with the requirements of this title as to the adoption of a resolution of necessity and the advertisement and award of a contract for the improvement. Assessment proceedings under this section are valid notwithstanding any failure of the previous proceedings to comply with the provisions of law regarding improvements to be financed by special assessments. The governing body may use a reasonable depreciation schedule for the improvement in determining the amount of any special assessment subsequently levied under this section.

     <p>
      For any improvement consisting of acquiring or leasing of property and easements and construction of parking lots, ramps, garages, and other facilities for motor vehicles, whether constructed pursuant to chapter 40-22, 40-60, or 40-61 or other law authorizing a municipality to acquire facilities used and usable in connection with the parking and storing of motor vehicles, the governing body of the municipality, on or before October first in any year, may cancel all installments of special assessments theretofore levied for such facilities which are due and payable in the following year and all subsequent years, and may levy a new assessment for such facility in accordance with the law authorizing the initial levy of special assessments therefor, except that the amount to be newly assessed shall not exceed the total principal amount of the installments of assessments so canceled. The new assessment shall follow the same district lines as the original assessment district, and the same method of assessment shall be used as was used in the original assessment. If the new assessment causes any prepaid payment to be refunded, the refund plus four and one-half percent interest per annum on the refunded prepaid payment shall be paid to the person, corporation, or limited liability company who prepaid the original assessment. In determining the special benefit and levying the new assessment against any lot or parcel, the previous determination of special benefit in any previous proceeding shall not be binding upon the assessment commission or governing body, but the new assessment levied on any lot or parcel, together with the principal amount of the installments of special assessments previously paid or to be paid in the current year for that lot or parcel with respect to that facility to be assessed, if any, shall not exceed the total special benefit to the lot or parcel from the facility for which the assessment is levied. In levying new assessments pursuant to this authority, an assessment commission and governing body of a municipality may take into account any changes in conditions affecting the benefits derived and to be derived from the improvement for which the assessments were initially levied against the respective properties assessed. Provided, however, that in canceling any special assessments previously levied and in levying new special assessments, a municipality cannot violate any covenants or agreements which it has made with holders of any obligations issued by the municipality to finance the acquisition of that improvement.

     <p>
      If the costs of an improvement determined and assessed under section 40-23-07 or 40-23.1-04 exceed the costs of the work as contained in the engineer’s estimate under section 40-22-10 by seventy percent or more, the governing body of the city shall secure an audit of all costs included in the assessment for the project, prepared in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The audit report must include a separate statement of the engineer’s estimate of the cost of the work, the actual cost of the work, the cost of extra work, engineering fees, fiscal agent’s fees, attorney’s fees, publication costs, warrant printing costs, interest costs, and each separate item of expense incurred in making the improvement and levying the assessment for the improvement. The city shall make a copy of the audit report available without charge to any person who requests a copy. The audit report is not required if the costs of an improvement exceed the costs of the work as contained in the engineer’s estimate by seventy percent or more because of a petition to enlarge the district under section 40-22-09 or a request for additional work within the district by the owners of a majority of the area of the property in the district. Audit and copying expenses under this section must be paid by the city and may not be paid from special assessment funds.

       Plain language evidenced a legislative intent that the engineer’s report and resolution of necessity contained an estimate of the cost of the project and that the final cost and amount to be assessed could exceed the amounts listed in the resolution of necessity and engineer’s report; the landowner did not claim the city failed to comply with N.D.C.C. §§ 40-22-29 or 40-23-24, and the total amount of the special assessments did not improperly exceed the amounts estimated in the resolution of necessity and engineer’s report.

        An urban renewal condemnation proceeding is a compulsory sale wherein the landowner is the involuntary vendor and the condemning agency is the vendee; hence, this section applies to such a proceeding so that the urban renewal agency is liable for unpaid special assessments on the condemned property.

     <p>
      Any municipality, at the option of its governing body, may provide for the payment by general taxation of all the taxable property in the municipality of not more than one-fifth of the cost of any improvement financed by the levying of special assessments other than the opening and widening of streets or the laying of sewer or water connections from the main to the curb line. Any amount which the municipality shall determine to pay by general assessment shall be considered as a part of the debt of the municipality and shall not be valid unless such amount is within the constitutional debt limit of such municipality. Any incorporated city, by a two-thirds vote of the qualified voters thereof voting upon the question at a general or special election, may increase its limit of indebtedness three percent on the assessed valuation of taxable property in such city beyond five percent of the valuation thereof, and by a majority vote, in like manner, may increase its limit of indebtedness four percent of such valuation without regard to the existing indebtedness of such city for the purpose of constructing or purchasing waterworks for furnishing a supply of water to the inhabitants of such city, or for the purpose of constructing sewers; provided, that such increase or increases must be duly voted before the levy of any general taxes exceeding the existing debt limit may be made to pay part of the cost of any such improvement. In making any contract with reference to any special improvement, the governing body may take into consideration such portion of the cost of the improvement as will be paid by general assessment and may make appropriations and levy taxes and assessments therefor in annual installments extending over the same period of time as is provided in the special assessments for such improvement. The appropriation may be made at such time as occasion may require and shall be included in the municipality’s first annual tax levy thereafter. The appropriation and levy, whether it is made as a part of the regular annual appropriation ordinance or otherwise, shall state the specific improvement for which the assessment is made and the tax levied, the amount thereof, and the district in which the improvement is made. The amount of such assessment and the moneys collected thereon shall become a part of the district fund upon which the warrants issued in payment for the improvement are to be drawn.

      The municipality, at any time after making a contract for the construction of any improvement to be financed in whole or in part by assessments, under authority of any chapter of this title, or prior thereto but after the period for filing protests against the making of such improvement has expired and the protests filed, if any, have been heard and determined to be insufficient, and in anticipation of the levy and collection of such assessments and of any taxes or revenues derived from service charges pledged to pay for such improvement, may issue warrants or improvement bonds on the fund created for such improvement. The municipality is responsible to the holders of the warrants or improvement bonds for the proper advertisement and award of a contract or contracts or provision by other means for the completion of the improvement; for the acquisition of all land, easements, licenses, and permits required for such completion; and for the valid and final levy of special assessments upon all properties within the improvement district to be benefited by the improvement, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the total cost of the improvement as finally ascertained, less the portions thereof, if any, determined to be paid from taxes, service charges, and any other source. The issuance of the warrants or improvement bonds constitutes a representation and covenant binding upon the municipality that the aggregate benefits to be derived from the making of the improvement by the properties to be assessed therefor are not less than the aggregate amount of the special assessments so required to be levied. The warrants or improvement bonds shall be issued and shall mature in such amounts as in the judgment of the governing body will be provided for, at or before the maturity dates specified, by the taxes and assessments to be levied and spread and the revenues pledged therefor. In lieu of issuing definitive warrants or improvement bonds on any such fund, the governing body may by resolution authorize the issuance and sale of temporary warrants or temporary improvement bonds maturing in not to exceed three years from the date of issue of the first such warrant or temporary improvement bonds, to be repaid with interest from the proceeds of definitive warrants or improvement bonds maturing as hereinabove required, which the governing body shall issue and sell at or before the maturing date of said temporary warrants or temporary improvement bonds, in the amount required, with moneys theretofore received in such fund, to pay the total cost of the improvement and all temporary warrants or temporary improvement bonds theretofore issued on the fund, with interest then accrued thereon. The warrants or temporary improvement bonds must bear interest at a rate or rates and must be sold at a price, not less than ninety-eight percent of par, resulting in an average net interest cost not to exceed twelve percent per annum payable annually or semiannually, except that there is no interest rate ceiling on an issue sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The definitive warrants or improvement bonds may bear interest at a rate or rates higher or lower than those borne by the temporary warrants or temporary improvement bonds, as determined by the governing body in effecting the sale thereof. In the sale of temporary warrants or temporary improvement bonds, the municipality may by resolution of the governing body agree to issue to the holder or holders thereof definitive warrants or improvement bonds upon specified terms as to interest, maturity, redemption provisions, and all other pertinent details, in the event that the municipality is unable to sell definitive warrants or improvement bonds to others upon more favorable terms. Coupons representing the interest for each year or lesser period may be attached to the warrants, whether definitive or temporary, or improvement bonds or temporary improvement bonds. All such warrants or bonds shall be negotiable within the meaning of and for all the purposes specified in title 41, and, to the same extent as general obligation bonds of the issuing municipality, are valid investments of the funds of any guardian, trustee, and other fiduciary of any kind or nature, any bank or other financial institution, any charitable, educational, or eleemosynary institution, and any public corporation or official, municipality, school district, or other political subdivision, including bond sinking funds, special improvement funds, municipal utility funds, and funds of the state of North Dakota and its instrumentalities and agencies.

    Courts to review levy and apportionment of special assessments — De novo review for agricultural property assessments.

     <p>
      The courts shall review the levy and apportionment of the special assessments in all actions and proceedings involving the validity or apportionment of any special assessment for local or special improvements. If an action challenges the determination of benefits and special assessments imposed for agricultural property, the decision of the special assessment commission regarding agricultural property is not entitled to deference by the court and the court shall consider the determination of benefits and special assessments imposed for agricultural property de novo. An appeal taken under this section must be in accordance with the procedure provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-34s28-34-01" target="_blank">28-34-01.</a></cite>

        Although prior to adoption of this section in 1919, owners of property affected by special assessment were precluded on question of benefits by action of special assessment commission as reviewed by city council or commission and were entitled to no relief from that determination unless there existed one of usual grounds of equitable interference; adoption of this chapter broadens scope of review so that when action is timely brought to set aside determination of special benefits of special assessment commission, court is now required to review determination to see if it is true and just, and if it is not, to make true and just determination, providing determination of special assessment commission has been appealed to governing body and has been acted upon by it. Foss Methodist Church v. Wahpeton, 157 N.W.2d 347, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though a trial de novo was demanded on appeal from determination of special assessment commission, court’s review was limited to determination whether the commission was within its jurisdiction, was not mistaken as to applicable law, and did not act arbitrarily, oppressively, or unreasonably, and to determination whether there was substantial evidence to support or justify the determination. Soo Line R.R. v. City of Wilton, 172 N.W.2d 74, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in substituting its judgment for that of special assessment commission where commission did not act arbitrarily, oppressively, or unreasonably and where there was substantial evidence to support and justify its determination. United Pub. Sch. Dist. v. Burlington, 196 N.W.2d 65, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not the province of the court to substitute its judgment for that of the commission making the assessment, but merely to determine whether the commission was within its jurisdiction, was not mistaken as to the applicable law, and did not act arbitrarily, oppressively, or unreasonably, and to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support or justify the determination. Cloverdale Foods Co. v. Mandan, 364 N.W.2d 56, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 260</cite> (N.D. 1985).

      The court shall determine the true and just amount which any property attempted to be specially assessed for a special improvement should pay to make the same uniform with other special assessments for the same purpose, whenever any action or proceeding shall be commenced and maintained before the court to prevent or restrain the collection of any special assessment or part thereof made or levied by the officers of any municipality for any purpose authorized by law, if such assessment shall be held to be void by reason of noncompliance with any provision of the laws of this state. Unless the action challenges the determination of benefits and special assessments imposed for agricultural property, the amount of the assessment as the same appears on the assessment list shall be prima facie evidence of the true and just amount, and judgment must be rendered and given therefor against the party liable for such special assessment without regard to the proceedings had for the levy thereof. The judgment shall be a lien upon the property upon which a special assessment shall have been levied, of the same force and effect as the lien of a special assessment, and the lien of such special judgment shall be enforced by the court in such action. No action for said purposes shall be maintained unless it is commenced within six months after the special assessment is approved.

     <p>
      Whenever all special assessments and all utility revenues and taxes, if any, appropriated and theretofore collected for a special improvement, made under authority of any law authorizing the payment of the cost thereof in whole or in part from special assessments, are insufficient to pay principal or interest then due on the special improvement warrants issued against such improvement, the governing body shall levy a tax upon all of the taxable property in the municipality for the payment of such deficiency. If at any time a deficiency is likely to occur within one year in such special improvement fund for the payment of principal and interest due on such warrants, the governing body, in its discretion, may levy a general tax upon all the taxable property in the municipality for the payment of such deficiency. This section applies to any deficiency in a special improvement fund, including a sewer and water connections assessment fund under chapter 40-28, sidewalk special fund under chapter 40-29, curbing special fund under chapter 40-31, and boulevard special fund under chapter 40-32. In case a balance remains unexpended in a special improvement fund after the payment of all warrants drawn thereon with interest, it shall be paid over or transferred to the general fund of the municipality.

     <p>
      A special fund or special funds shall be created in accordance with this section for the payment of refunding special assessment warrants or bonds. Such special fund may be created as a single consolidated fund for warrants or bonds issued to refund special assessment warrants or bonds of more than one district, or a separate special fund may be created for warrants or bonds issued to refund special assessment warrants or bonds of each district. In either case, the refunded warrants or bonds shall not be canceled but shall be retained by the municipality as an asset of the fund from which the refunding warrants or bonds are payable. The special fund or funds from which the refunded warrants or bonds are payable shall be continued, and payments therefrom shall be made on the warrants or bonds drawn thereon, in the same manner as though none of such warrants or bonds had been refunded. All payments made on the principal and on the interest of refunded warrants or bonds shall be credited to the fund from which the appropriate refunding warrants or bonds are payable and shall be applied in payment of the principal and on the interest on the refunding warrants or bonds in the manner prescribed by the resolution authorizing the issuance of such refunding warrants or bonds. To the extent refunding warrants or bonds are issued to refund the principal or interest, or both, of warrants or bonds, due or to become due within one year, for which a deficiency exists or is likely to exist in the fund or funds against which such outstanding warrants or bonds are drawn due to nonpayment or anticipated nonpayment of special assessments, any payments of such delinquent special assessments and such amounts of accrued interest and penalty thereon as necessary shall be set aside for the payment or redemption of the refunding warrants or bonds issued to fund such delinquencies.

    Refunding callable funding bonds or refunding warrants — Terms and conditions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any municipality may refund, according to the procedure set forth in this chapter, any funding bonds issued under this chapter which are callable prior to maturity or which shall be surrendered voluntarily for refunding, by the issuance of bonds upon the same terms and conditions except as to interest, whenever by so doing a saving in interest can be effected. Any municipality having valid outstanding refunding special improvement warrants or bonds issued pursuant to this chapter, which are due, or to become due within one year, in whole or in part as to principal or interest or both or which are redeemable either at the option of the municipality or with the consent of the warrantholders or bondholders, may issue new refunding special improvement bonds to refund such outstanding warrants or bonds, if there is not sufficient money in the fund or funds against which such outstanding refunding warrants or bonds are drawn to pay the principal or interest or both or if a deficiency is likely to occur in the fund or funds within one year for payment of principal or interest thereon. Such new bonds may be issued for the purpose of extending the maturities of the outstanding refunding warrants or bonds, or reducing the debt service thereon, or equalizing the general tax which the municipality may be, or may become, obligated to levy to discharge deficiencies in the fund or funds against which they are drawn. Such new bonds shall be issued according to the procedure set forth in this chapter for the issuance of the original refunding special improvement warrants or bonds. If refunding improvement bonds are issued and sold six months or more before the earliest date on which all outstanding refunding improvement warrants or bonds of the issue to be refunded thereby mature or are prepayable in accordance with their terms, the proceeds of the new bonds, including any premium and accrued interest, shall be deposited in escrow with a suitable bank or trust company, having its principal place of business within or without the state, and shall be invested in such amount and in securities maturing on such dates and bearing interest at such rates as shall be required to provide funds sufficient to pay when due the interest to accrue on each warrant or bond refunded to its maturity or, if it is prepayable and called for redemption, to an earlier prior date upon which it may be called for redemption, and to pay and redeem the principal amount of each such warrant or bond at maturity or, if prepayable and called for redemption, at the earlier redemption date, and any premium required for redemption on such date, or in the case of a crossover refunding, must be invested in securities irrevocably appropriated to the payment of principal and interest on the refunding improvement bonds until the date the proceeds are applied to the payment or redemption of the bonds or warrants to be refunded. The governing body’s resolution authorizing the new bonds shall irrevocably appropriate for these purposes the escrow fund and all investments thereof, which shall be held in safekeeping by the escrow agent, and all income therefrom, and may provide for the call for redemption of all prepayable bonds in accordance with their terms. The securities to be purchased with the escrow fund shall be limited to general obligations of the United States, securities whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the United States, and securities issued by the following United States government agencies: banks for cooperatives, federal home loan banks, federal intermediate credit banks, federal land banks, and the federal national mortgage association. Such securities shall be purchased simultaneously with the delivery of the new bonds. Moneys on hand in the refunding improvement bond fund maintained for the payment of the outstanding bonds, and not immediately needed for the payment of interest or principal due, or other legally available funds of the municipality may likewise be deposited in the escrow fund and invested in the same manner as the proceeds of the new bonds, to the extent consistent with the provisions of resolutions authorizing the outstanding bonds.

    Notice to construct, rebuild, or repair sidewalks.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, if the governing body deems it necessary to construct, rebuild, or repair any sidewalk in the municipality, it shall notify each owner of record at the last address shown in the recorder or the county treasurer or occupant of any lot or parcel of land that would be benefited by the sidewalk to construct, rebuild, or repair the same at the owner’s own expense and subject to the approval of the street commissioner or city engineer, within the time designated in the notice. The notice must be directed in the manner hereinbefore provided to the owner of record or occupant and must set forth what work is to be done, the character of the same as specified in the ordinance, and the time within which the owner is required to do the work. The work must be done to the satisfaction of the street commissioner or city engineer. The notice may be general as to the owner of record or occupant but must be specific as to the description of the lot or parcel of ground to be benefited by the sidewalk that is to be built or repaired. The street commissioner or city engineer shall serve such notice by certified mail or delivering a copy thereof to the occupant or owner of record of each lot or parcel of occupied land described in the notice, or as to the occupant by leaving a copy thereof at the dwelling house upon such lot or parcel of land with some person over the age of fourteen years residing therein. If any lot or parcel of land is not occupied and service by mail is deemed impractical, the commissioner or city engineer may serve the notice by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place therein or immediately in front thereof. If such sidewalk is not repaired within the time fixed in such notice, the street commissioner or city engineer, as soon as practicable, shall repair the same and certify the cost thereof, with the person’s return of service of the notice, to the city auditor, and the cost of such repairs must be paid out of the sidewalk special fund.

      Whenever the governing body of any city shall deem it necessary to install, construct, alter, or extend, upon any of the streets of the city, a special system or special systems of streetlighting, such governing body may direct the city engineer or such other person as shall be designated, by motion or resolution, to prepare plans and specifications for such work and to make an estimate of the probable cost. Such plans, specifications, and estimates shall be approved by resolution of the governing body and filed in the office of the city auditor. The city auditor thereupon shall publish in the official newspaper of the city once each week for three successive weeks a notice stating that such plans, specifications, and estimates have been approved and filed in the city auditor’s office and are open to public inspection. If the owners of a majority of the property abutting on any street or streets where such lighting system is to be installed shall not protest against the lighting system or improvement within ten days after the last publication of such notice, the majority of such owners shall be deemed to have consented thereto, and the city may proceed to provide for the construction of the improvement and to assess the cost thereof, or such part thereof as the governing body shall deem proper, against the abutting property in the manner and with the notice and according to the forms and procedure provided in this title for the construction and assessment of street paving.

     <p>
      Whenever in the judgment of the street commissioner the necessary repairs on curbing will not exceed in cost the sum of ten dollars for each twenty-five feet [7.62 meters] in front of land belonging to the same owner, the commissioner shall notify the city auditor thereof, and the city auditor forthwith shall prepare a written notice, which may be general as to the owners of the lots or parcels of land but which shall describe specifically the lots or parcels of land adjacent to which the curbing is ordered repaired, requiring such owners to repair such curbing to the satisfaction of the street commissioner within a time to be fixed in such notice. The street commissioner shall serve such notice by delivering a copy thereof to the occupant or owner of each parcel of occupied land or by leaving a copy thereof at the dwelling house upon such lot or parcel with some person over the age of fourteen years residing therein. If any lot or parcel of land is not occupied, the commissioner shall serve the notice by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place thereon or immediately in front thereof. If such curbing is not repaired within the time fixed in the notice, the street commissioner, as soon as practicable, shall repair the same and certify the cost thereof, with the street commissioner’s return of service of the notice, to the city auditor, and the cost of such repairs shall be paid out of the curbing special fund.

      For purposes of subsection 5, the term “lease” includes any lease, sublease, purchase agreement, lease-purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement, leaseback agreement, or other contract, agreement, instrument, or arrangement pursuant to which any rights, interests, or other property are transferred to, by, or from any party to, by, or from one or more parties, and any related documents entered or to be entered, including any operating agreement, service agreement, indemnity agreement, participation agreement, loan agreement, or payment undertaking agreement. A lease obligation of a municipality under subsection 5 may not exceed a term of ninety-nine years. A lease obligation of a municipality under subsection 5 does not constitute an indebtedness of the municipality or a pledge of the full faith and credit or unlimited taxing resources of the municipality. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a municipality may solicit and accept one or more proposals for a lease transaction, including the arrangement thereof, under subsection 5. The municipality, by resolution of its governing body upon a majority vote of the members of the governing body, may accept a proposal that it determines to be in the public interest. A lease under subsection 5, and any related documents entered or to be entered, may be authorized by resolution of the governing body of the municipality.

      No municipal officers may purchase, erect, substantially enlarge, improve, or extend an existing plant, or lease from others any plant, system, or line provided for in section 40-33-01, unless the proposition has been submitted by a resolution of the governing body to the qualified electors of the city at a biennial or special election called, held, and conducted upon the notice and in the manner specified by this title for the election of the governing body of the city, and has been approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon.

The special assessments levied shall be payable in equal annual installments extending over a period of not more than twenty years and shall bear interest at an annual rate of not more than one and one-half percentage points above the average net annual interest rate on any warrants for the payment of which they are pledged on the total amount of the assessments remaining unpaid.

       No contract to furnish water to out-of-town property owner existed where no effort was made to comply with statutory requirement that contract be executed by executive officer and city auditor; municipal officers could not ignore such requirements and create an implied contract by their conduct, their acquiescence in extending such service giving, at best, the water users a license which city could not arbitrarily terminate, but which could be terminated for good cause.

      Any city may create a board to be known as a “municipal steam heating authority”. Such board shall be a body corporate, constituting a public benefit corporation, and its existence shall commence upon the appointment of the members as herein provided. It shall consist of a chairman and four other members, who shall be appointed by the governing body of the city. Three members of the board shall be property owners within the benefited areas and two members shall be appointed at large. Of the members first appointed, one shall be appointed for a period of one year, one for a period of two years, one for a period of three years, one for a period of four years, and one for a period of five years. At the expiration of such terms, the terms of office of their successors shall be five years. Each member shall continue to serve until the appointment and qualification of the member’s successor. Vacancies in such board occurring otherwise than by the expiration of a term shall be filled for the unexpired term. The members of the board shall choose from their number a chairman and a vice chairman. The governing body of the city may remove any member of the board for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or misconduct in office, giving that member a copy of the charges against that member and an opportunity of being heard in person, or by counsel, in that member’s defense upon not less than ten days’ notice. The members of the board shall be entitled to no compensation for their services but shall be entitled to reimbursement for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties. The powers of the authority shall be vested in and exercised by a majority of the members of the board then in office. Such board may delegate to one or more of its members or to its officers, agents, and employees such powers and duties as it may deem proper. Such board and the corporate existence of the authority shall continue until all its liabilities have been met and until the existence of the authority is terminated by official action of the governing body of the city. Upon its ceasing to exist, all its rights and properties shall pass to the city.

An authority shall have power, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, to contract with the holders of any of its notes as to the custody, collection, securing, investment, and payment of any moneys of the authority, or any moneys held in trust or otherwise for the payment of notes or in any way to secure notes, and to carry out any such contract notwithstanding that such contract may be inconsistent with the previous provisions of this section. Moneys held in trust or otherwise for the payment of notes or in any way to secure notes and deposits of such moneys may be acquired in the same manner as moneys of the authority, and all banks and trust companies are authorized to give such security for such deposits.

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 40-33.1-08, an authority may provide by such trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the notes and the revenues of the project or projects to the trustee under such trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as it may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out such trust indenture may be treated as a part of the cost of maintenance, operation, and repairs of the project or projects.

    Findings and purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means for North Dakota cities which operate a utility under law for the local distribution of electric energy to secure, by individual or joint action among themselves or by contract with other public or private entities within or outside the state, an adequate, economical, and reliable supply of energy. To accomplish this purpose it is necessary for cities to have the authority, by agreement between two or more of their number, to create a separate municipal corporation with the power and authority to finance and acquire facilities for the generation or transmission of electric energy or interests in those facilities or rights to part or all of the capacity thereof. It is determined that an adequate, economical, and reliable supply of electric energy is essential to the orderly growth and prosperity of communities, and a shortage of electrical energy is inimical to the safety, health, welfare, and prosperity of residents of the state and to the sound growth and development of its communities. Such a shortage exists and is expected to continue and increase because of the difficulty in the operation of municipal generating plants, of achieving economies of size, limiting environmental impacts, and providing for peak loads. Accordingly, it is determined that the exercise of the authority granted herein will benefit the people of the state and serve a valid public purpose in improving and otherwise promoting their health, welfare, and prosperity.

       Where city is given express authority to furnish water outside of city under certain circumstances, it has, by implication, power to furnish sewer service to such areas outside of city; since furnishing of sewer service within city grants only license to users, power to furnish such service to users outside city is no greater; where license to out-of-city users was granted in interest of national defense, any action of city revoking such license after defense project had been completed would not be arbitrary or unreasonable.

    Methods of defraying cost of sewage or garbage disposal improvements or lease.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The total cost of a sewage or garbage disposal system, or any portion thereof, may be defrayed by the following alternative methods:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t40c40-34s40-34-02ol11">
       Out of the general current tax revenues on hand and appropriated for that purpose.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-34s40-34-02ol12">
       Out of the proceeds of the sale of general liability bonds issued in accordance with the procedure and subject to the conditions and limitations prescribed by chapter 21-03, as far as the same are applicable.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-34s40-34-02ol13">
       Partly out of general current tax revenues on hand and appropriated for that purpose and the residue out of the proceeds of the sale of general liability bonds as provided in subsection 2, as the governing body of the municipality shall determine by a majority vote.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-34s40-34-02ol14">
       Partly from moneys secured by the issuance of mortgage bonds secured by the net revenues of the improvement or system and by a mortgage or deed of trust upon the improvement or system issued by the municipality. Bonds issued under this subsection shall not exceed sixty percent of the cost of the improvement, and the remaining forty percent of such cost shall be defrayed as provided in subsection 1, 2, or 3.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-34s40-34-02ol15">
       From moneys secured by the issuance and sale of first mortgage bonds secured by the assets and property of the improvement or system in like manner as provided in subsection 4, except that such bonds may be issued for the total cost of the improvement upon compliance with this subsection. Bonds issued under this subsection shall be secured by a pledge of the net revenues of the improvement or system to be set apart as an interest and sinking fund to pay the principal and interest of such first mortgage bonds as they mature. If the method provided in this subsection is utilized by any municipality to defray the cost of a sewage disposal system, it, by a resolution of its governing body, shall create the district, provide for and approve the plans and specifications and estimates of the cost, and adopt and publish the resolution declaring the work necessary to be done in accordance with the requirements of chapter 40-22 as far as the same may be applicable. If the owners of property liable to be imposed with the sewage disposal service charges as provided in this subsection shall file with the city auditor, within thirty days after the first publication of the resolution, a written protest against the improvement, the governing body at its next meeting after the expiration of the time for filing protests against the improvement shall hear and determine the sufficiency of the protests. After the hearing has been had, the governing body, if it finds the protests to contain the signatures of the owners of a majority of the property liable to be charged, shall not proceed further with the improvement. If the protests are found insufficient or invalid, the governing body of the municipality may cause the improvement to be made, contract therefor, and defray the cost thereof in the manner provided in this subsection.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A municipality may pay the cost of leasing any sewage systems and all related real and personal property for the collection, treatment, purification, and disposal in a sanitary manner of sewage from the state, or any agency or institution of the state under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-34s40-34-01" target="_self">40-34-01.</a></cite>2, solely from revenues to be derived by the municipality from the ownership, sale, lease, disposition, and operation of the sewage systems; the funds or any other amounts invested by the municipality pursuant to section 21-06-07, or invested on the municipality’s behalf by the state, or any agency of the state, in conformity with policies of the industrial commission, including investment in a guaranteed investment contract and any earnings thereon, to the extent pledged therefor; and funds, if any, appropriated annually by the governing body of the municipality or received from federal or state sources.

The bonds shall be sold for not less than ninety-eight percent of par and shall bear interest at a rate or rates resulting in an average annual net interest cost of not more than twelve percent per annum on those issues which are sold at private sale. There is no interest rate ceiling on those issues sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. No bonds shall be issued, however, except upon the affirmative vote of three-fifths or more of the members of the governing body of the issuing municipality, and the form, recitals, maturities, rate of interest, and whether the bonds shall be payable annually or semiannually, shall be determined by the same vote. A municipality is authorized to execute and deliver any mortgage or deed of trust contemplated under this chapter.

       Municipal bonds issued for construction of a sewage disposal plant and payable from rental for use of a sewer system were not a “general liability” of the municipality, requiring a vote of electors, though the deficiency in the rental fund, to meet the last maturing bonds, was to be made up by a tax levy.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a default occurs in the payment of the principal or interest of any bonds secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the improvement and such default continues for a period of not less than six months, an action may be commenced in the district court of the county in which such improvement or some part thereof is located, by the holder or holders of not less than one-half of the outstanding past-due bonds or by the legal holder of the deed of trust, when authorized by a like number of bondholders, for the purpose of foreclosing the mortgage or deed of trust securing such bonds. In such action, the court may enter a decree providing for the management and operation of such improvement by a court receiver and for the sale of the property secured by such mortgage or trust deed and for the application of the net revenues arising from the operation of such plant upon the secured debt during the period of redemption, which shall be one year from and after the date of the sale thereof. If there is no redemption from such sale within the time herein provided, a sheriff’s deed shall issue to the holder of the certificate of sale. The procedure subsequent to the entry of a foreclosure decree shall be, as far as applicable, that provided in title 32 for the sale of real property under special execution.

      Notwithstanding any other law, any municipality of the state, either individually or jointly by agreement, may enter agreements to lease to the state, or any agency or institution of the state, or to any person for such compensation and upon such terms and conditions as the parties under such agreement may stipulate, all or part of, or an undivided or other interest in, its sewage system and all related real and personal property for the collection, treatment, purification, and disposal in a sanitary manner of sewage. In addition, any municipality of the state, either individually or jointly by agreement, may enter agreements to lease from the state, or any agency or institution of the state, or from any person all or part of, or an undivided or other interest in, its sewage system and all related real and personal property for the collection, treatment, purification, and disposal in a sanitary manner of sewage for such compensation and upon such terms and conditions as the parties under such agreement may stipulate. Such agreements must be authorized by resolution of the governing body of a municipality upon a majority vote of the members of the governing body. For the purposes of this section, such agreements include any lease, sublease, purchase agreement, lease-purchase agreement, installment purchase agreement, leaseback agreement, or other contract, agreement, instrument, or arrangement pursuant to which any rights, interests, or other property are transferred to, by, or from any party to, by, or from one or more parties, and any related documents entered or to be entered, including any operating agreement, service agreement, indemnity agreement, participation agreement, loan agreement, or payment undertaking agreement. A lease obligation under this section may not exceed a term of ninety-nine years. A lease obligation under this section does not constitute an indebtedness of the municipality or a pledge of the full faith and credit or unlimited taxing resources of the municipality. Notwithstanding any other law, a municipality may solicit and accept one or more proposals for a lease transaction, including the arrangement thereof, under this section. The municipality may, by resolution of the governing body upon a majority vote of the members of the governing body, accept a proposal that it determines to be in the public interest.

      Refunding bonds may be sold or exchanged in installments at different times, or an entire issue or series may be sold or exchanged at one time. Any issue or series of refunding bonds may be exchanged in part or sold in part in installments at different times or at one time, and such bonds may be sold or exchanged at any time on, before, or after the maturity of any of the outstanding notes, bonds, certificates, or other obligations to be refinanced thereby.

      <li id="t40c40-36s40-36-13ol11">
       Exchange any refunding bonds, such bonds may be exchanged privately for, and in payment and discharge of, any of the outstanding notes, bonds, or other obligations of the municipality issued to finance or to aid in financing the acquisition, construction, improvement, or refinancing of an enterprise. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for a like or a greater principal amount of such notes, bonds, or other obligations of the municipality. The principal amount of the refunding bonds, however, may exceed the principal amount of outstanding notes, bonds, or other obligations for which they are exchanged only to the extent necessary or advisable, in the discretion of the governing body, to fund interest in arrears or about to become due. The holder or holders of such outstanding notes, bonds, or other obligations need not pay accrued interest on the refunding bonds to be delivered in exchange therefor if, and to the same extent that, interest is due or accrued and unpaid on such outstanding notes, bonds, or other obligations to be surrendered.
      </li>

The governing body’s resolution authorizing the refunding bonds shall irrevocably appropriate for these purposes the escrow fund and all investments thereof, which shall be held in safekeeping by the escrow agent, and all income therefrom, and may provide for the call for redemption of all prepayable bonds in accordance with their terms. The securities to be purchased with the escrow fund shall be limited to general obligations of the United States, securities whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the United States, and securities issued by the following United States government agencies: banks for cooperatives, federal home loan banks, federal intermediate credit banks, federal land banks, and the federal national mortgage association. Such securities shall be purchased simultaneously with the delivery of the refunding bonds. Moneys on hand in the sinking fund maintained for the payment of the outstanding bonds, and not immediately needed for the payment of interest or principal due, or other legally available funds of the municipality may likewise be deposited in the escrow fund and invested in the same manner as the proceeds of the new bonds, to the extent consistent with the provisions of resolutions authorizing the outstanding bonds.

      If it is necessary to take private property in order to open, lay out, widen, or enlarge any street or alley in any incorporated municipality, it shall be done by purchase or, subject to chapter 32-15, by the exercise of the right of eminent domain.

        Assessment of Damages.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In assessing damages for the taking of land for the widening of a street it is proper to assess the damages according to frontage, irrespective of whether the property is improved or not. City of Bismarck v. Casey, 77 N.D. 295, 43 N.W.2d 372, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The determination of value is not a matter of formulas or artificial rules, but of sound judgment and discretion based upon a consideration of all of the relevant facts in a particular case. City of Bismarck v. Casey, 77 N.D. 295, 43 N.W.2d 372, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Future speculative value on the theory that adjoining landowners would be forced or compelled to buy a right-of-way for ingress and egress to their property is an improper element to be taken into consideration in fixing the reasonable market value of land in a condemnation proceeding. City of Bismarck v. Casey, 77 N.D. 295, 43 N.W.2d 372, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 1950).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The preliminary budget must include a detailed breakdown of the estimated revenues and appropriations requested for the ensuing year for the general fund, each special revenue fund, and each debt service fund of the municipality. The revenue and expenditure items for the preceding year and estimates of the revenue and expenditures for the current year must be included for each fund to assist in determining the estimated revenues and appropriation requested for the ensuing year. The budget must also include any transfers in or out and the beginning and ending fund balance for each of the funds. The budget must be prepared on the same basis of accounting used by the municipality for its annual financial reports.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount paid for salaries may be shown as a single line item expenditure in each fund. There must be on file with the governing body and open to public inspection a detailed statement showing the names of all persons receiving salaries, the annual amount paid to each person, and the fund charged.
     </p>
     <p>
      While preparing the budget, municipal officials may include an expenditure item for equipment replacement, the amount of which may not exceed the total of the anticipated reasonable costs of depreciation for the ensuing year, based on current costs, of all equipment owned by the municipality. The expenditure for equipment replacement must be placed in a separate special revenue fund. No expenditure may be paid from the equipment replacement fund except for equipment purchases to replace equipment that is worn out, damaged, or obsolete. The term “equipment” does not include structures or building fixtures.
     </p>
     <p>
      While preparing the budget, municipal officials may include an expenditure item for a building reserve fund, the amount of which may not exceed the total of the anticipated reasonable costs of depreciation for the ensuing year, based on the original costs of all buildings and structures owned by the city. The expenditure for building reserve must be placed in a separate capital projects fund. No expenditures may be paid from the building reserve fund except for the purchase, construction, or remodeling of buildings or structures that are obsolete, substandard, or generally unfit for public use.

     <p>
      After completing the final budget on or before October seventh, the governing body shall proceed to make the annual tax levy in an amount sufficient to meet the expenses for the ensuing year as determined at the budget meeting. In determining the amount required to be levied, the governing body first shall ascertain its net current resources by adding the estimated revenue for the ensuing year other than property taxes, any transfers in, and the estimated fund balance at the end of the current year. Then the governing body shall ascertain its appropriation and reserve by adding the final appropriation for the ensuing year, any transfers out, and the cash reserve. The net current resources must be deducted from the appropriation and reserve and the balance shall be considered the amount that is required to be raised by taxation during the ensuing year. The determination of the amount of the levy that can be collected within the ensuing year must be made by the governing body based upon the past experience of the district. The levy as finally adopted must be approved by a majority vote of the members of the governing body and noted in the proceedings of the governing body. The amount levied is subject to the limitations as prescribed by the laws of this state and is subject to the further limitation that the amount may not exceed the levy requested by the municipality. The levy adopted must appropriate in specific amounts the money necessary to meet the expenses and liabilities of the municipality.

        Where city charter gave mayor a veto power as to resolutions and ordinances passed by city council, failure of mayor to approve tax levy resulted in its invalidity. O'Neil v. Tyler, 3 N.D. 47, 53 N.W. 434, 1892 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 9</cite> (N.D. 1892).

        City levies must be based upon the annual appropriation bill, and failure of the record to show the individual vote of councilmen does not render the levy void in its entirety. Douglas v. Fargo, 13 N.D. 467, 101 N.W. 919, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1904).

      After the county auditor has available the data showing the total taxable valuation of a municipality, the auditor shall calculate the necessary tax rates to produce the sums called for in the final budget. If the auditor finds that any amount or amounts called for in the levy cannot be produced by a tax rate within the limitation prescribed by the laws of this state, the auditor shall reduce the amount so that it can be produced by a tax rate within legal limitations. The auditor shall extend the levy, including the levy for judgments against the municipality, upon the tax lists of the county for the current year against each description of real property and all personal property within the municipality in the same manner and with the same effect as other taxes are extended. The county auditor shall notify the governing body of the municipality at once of any reductions made in the levy.

If the municipality has not reached its debt limit, the governing body, by the vote required to take moneys from a designated fund, may order its executive officer and financial committee to borrow an amount sufficient to meet the emergency. Any amount so borrowed must be for a time not to extend beyond the close of the fiscal year, and such amount and the interest thereon must be a part of the next budget. The resolution authorizing any emergency expenditure must recite the facts showing the existence of an emergency of the kind specified in this section.

The governing body may enter into contracts with persons, associations, corporations, or limited liability companies for the furnishing of water for fire protection to the municipality, and in case such contract extends over a term of years, it shall be unnecessary that a previous appropriation shall have been made except to cover the amounts payable under the contract for the first year thereof. Such a contract shall not be made for a longer period than twenty years.

      At the end of the fiscal year, the balance to the credit of each annual appropriation becomes a part of the general unappropriated balance in the municipal treasury, except that the unused balance to the credit of the equipment replacement fund provided for in section 40-40-05 does not become a part of the general unappropriated balance in the municipal treasury, but no special appropriation lapses until the work for which it was made has been completed, the bills paid, and the accounts closed. The governing body of a city may elect, at the end of the fiscal year, to carry over the unencumbered cash balance in the general fund or other budgeted funds and designate the balances for subsequent years.

      This chapter shall enable, authorize, and empower the governing body of any city having the requisite number of inhabitants to adopt a civil service system adapted to the size and requirements of the city. Such system, if deemed advisable by such body, may consist merely in the setting up of minimum employment qualifications for full-time members of the city’s paid fire and police departments and the heads thereof with provisions prohibiting their suspension, removal, or discharge, or the suspension, removal, or discharge of any other appointive employee or official except upon adequate reason and cause shown upon hearing and thereon after reasonable notice to the person or persons sought to be suspended, removed, or discharged. If deemed advisable by the governing body, the civil service system may consist of a comprehensive system covering all paid fire and police department full-time employees and the heads of these two departments and other appointive full-time employees and officials, other than common laborers and employees who have not been in the continuous employment of the city for a period of more than one year, as in the discretion of the governing body of the city may be for the best interests of the public, such employees, and the service to be rendered to the city.

The board may also invest all or part of such surplus funds in other investments by selecting a funding agent or agents and establish an investment agreement contract regarding such surplus funds. The contract shall authorize the funding agent or agents to hold and invest such funds for the board and such funds shall be placed for investment only with a firm or firms whose primary endeavor is money management, and only after a trust agreement or contract has been executed. The board of trustees may pay the fees and charges of said funding agent or agents from any surplus remaining in the police pension fund in excess of the moneys realized from any tax levy. The board of trustees may use a portion of the surplus left in the police pension fund in excess of moneys realized from any tax levy to pay the cost of actuarial studies of said pension system.

If any member shall have served twenty years in the department but shall not have reached the age of sixty years, the person shall be entitled to retirement, but no pension shall be paid while the person lives until the person reaches the age of sixty years, except as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-45s40-45-11" target="_self">40-45-11.</a></cite> Any member who has served one hundred eighty months but less than two hundred forty months, has contributed voluntarily to the police pension fund, and who voluntarily and while in good standing as a member has left employment of such city, shall be entitled to elect retirement instead of refund at a pension equal to the proportion of a full pension which the total number of months employed by the city bears to two hundred forty months, but no pension shall be paid while the person lives until the person reaches the age of sixty years. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, upon the approval of the governing body of the municipality, and at the discretion of the board of trustees if it shall find that the actuarial soundness of the fund would not be materially impaired, any member otherwise qualifying in accordance with the provisions of this section may retire if the person has reached the age of fifty-five years.

      If the governing body of the city shall determine by a two-thirds vote as provided in section 40-46-23 that the employees’ pension or police pension plan be discontinued, the plan shall be discontinued in such city and the governing body shall proceed to liquidate the pension fund created under such plan. Liquidation shall be accomplished by returning to each employee still in the employ of the city ten days after the date of the adoption of the resolution, provided for in section 40-46-23, the entire amount which has been deducted from the employee’s salary as an assessment or membership fee and then by payment of pension claims theretofore allowed in the same amounts as are then in effect until the death or disqualification of the pension claimant, and thereafter continuing such payments as would have accrued to survivors of such pension claimant under the local pension provisions if the plan had been continued. If the fund is insufficient to return the amount to which each employee is entitled as provided herein and to pay such claims in full, the governing body shall make an annual tax levy, which shall be in addition to any other tax levies authorized by law, in an amount sufficient to assure the payment in full of the pension claims theretofore allowed. If the fund exceeds the amount required to satisfy such returns and such claims, such excess shall be placed in the general fund of the city.

     <p>
      For the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community, the governing body of any city may, subject to the provisions of chapter 54-21.3, regulate and restrict the height, number of stories, and the size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts, and other open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade, industry, residence, or other purposes. The regulations may provide that a board of adjustment may determine and vary the application of the regulations in harmony with the regulations’ general purpose and intent and in accordance with general or specific rules contained in the regulations. The governing body of a city may establish institutional controls that address environmental concerns with the department of environmental quality as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.23.1.html#t23.1c23.1-10s23.1-10-16" target="_blank">23.1-10-16.</a></cite>

        District court properly enjoined landowners from parking heavy construction equipment on the premises pursuant to former Minot, N.D. Zoning Ordinance No. 2223 as the City could validly consider aesthetics under its authority to zone for the purpose of promoting the general welfare of the community under N.D.C.C. § 40-47-01; the zoning ordinance gave adequate warning of the proscribed conduct, and the district court’s finding that the landowners did not have a permissible “home occupation” under the zoning ordinance was not clearly erroneous.

        Where city gave property owner a conditional-use permit after a review process initiated by owner and during which owner disclosed his intent to use and rent automatic weapons in his commercial firing range, owner made substantial expenditures which he would not have made but for the city’s approval of the conditional-use permit, and city subsequently altered the permit by amending the ordinance regulating commercial firing ranges, and did not support that alteration by making a record of changed circumstances or the existence of a public hazard unknown and not considered during the original permit process, the record supported the trial court’s conclusion that the city was estopped from denying damages to owner in these unique circumstances.

A hearing may not be held until after at least two weeks’ written notice has been given to the governing bodies of the cities involved in the dispute. At the hearing, the governor’s appointee who mediated the meetings under subsection 6 shall provide information to the administrative law judge on the dispute between the cities involved and any proposed resolutions or recommendations made by a majority of the committee members. Any resident of, or person owning property in, a city involved in the dispute or the unincorporated territory that is the subject of the proposed extraterritorial zoning, a representative of such a resident or property owner, and any representative of a city involved, may appear at the hearing and present evidence on any matter to be determined by the administrative law judge. A decision by the administrative law judge is binding upon all the cities involved in the dispute and remains effective until the governing bodies of the cities agree to a change in the zoning authority of the cities. The governing body of a city may request a review of a decision of an administrative law judge due to changed circumstances at any time ten years after the decision has become final.

In addition to the members appointed by the city, the zoning commission shall include at least one person residing outside of the corporate limits of a city having a population of less than five thousand, two persons residing outside the corporate limits of a city having a population of five thousand or more, but less than twenty-five thousand, or three persons residing outside the corporate limits of a city having a population of twenty-five thousand or more if zoning authority is exercised pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-47s40-47-01" target="_self">40-47-01.</a></cite>1. Such persons shall be appointed by the board or boards of county commissioners of the county or counties within which such zoning authority is to be exercised and shall reside within the territorial limits of the zoning regulation authority exercised by the city, if such persons are available and will serve on the zoning commission. Of the members of the commission appointed by a board or boards of county commissioners pursuant to this section, the first member appointed shall hold office for five years, the second member appointed shall hold office for three years, and the third member appointed shall hold office for one year. Thereafter, the members shall be appointed for terms of five years. Such commission shall make a preliminary report and hold public hearings thereon before submitting its final report.

        In reviewing a decision of the city’s governing body, the trial court must be guided by the separation of power principles; judicial review of a nonjudicial governing body is limited to determining whether that body’s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable.

        Subsection (2) affords an expanded review by certiorari, beyond the question of jurisdiction, to include a determination of whether there is evidence to support the decision of the city’s governing body; the district court committed reversible error by limiting its review in city zoning ordinance violation case to a determination of whether the city acted within its jurisdiction. The court was obligated to conduct a broader scope of review. City of Fargo v. Ness, 529 N.W.2d 572, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 41</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       If two or more cities have boundaries at a distance where there is an overlap of extraterritorial subdivision regulation authority under this section, the governing bodies of the cities may enter into an agreement regarding the extraterritorial subdivision regulation authority of each city. The agreement must be for a specific term and is binding upon the cities unless the governing bodies of the cities agree to amend or rescind the agreement or unless determined otherwise by an administrative law judge in accordance with this chapter. If a dispute arises concerning the extraterritorial subdivision regulation authority of a city, and the governing bodies of the cities involved fail to resolve the dispute, the dispute must be submitted to a committee for mediation. The committee must be comprised of one member appointed by the governor, one member of the governing body of each city, and one member of the planning commission of each city who resides outside the corporate city limits.

A hearing may not be held until after at least two weeks’ written notice has been given to the governing bodies of the cities involved in the dispute. At the hearing, the governor’s appointee who mediated the meetings under subsection 2 shall provide information to the administrative law judge on the dispute between the cities involved and any proposed resolutions or recommendations made by a majority of the committee members. Any resident of, or person owning property in, a city involved in the dispute or the unincorporated territory that is the subject of the proposed subdivision regulation, a representative of such a resident or property owner, and any representative of a city involved, may appear at the hearing and present evidence on any matter to be determined by the administrative law judge. A decision by the administrative law judge is binding upon all the cities involved in the dispute and remains effective until the governing bodies of the cities agree to a change in the subdivision regulation authority of the cities. The governing body of a city may request a review of a decision of an administrative law judge due to changed circumstances at any time ten years after the decision has become final.

     <p>
      Within thirty days after the submission of a plat, the planning commission shall approve or disapprove the plat. If the plat is not approved or disapproved within that time, the plat is deemed to have been approved, and a certificate to that effect must be issued by the commission on demand. The applicant, however, may waive the requirement that the commission act within thirty days and may consent to an extension of the period. The commission shall state the grounds upon which any plat is approved or disapproved, and written findings upon which the decision is based must be included within the records of the commission. Any plat submitted to the commission must contain the name and address of an individual to whom notice of a hearing must be sent. No action may be taken by the commission upon any plat until the commission has afforded a hearing thereon. At least five days before the date fixed for the hearing, a notice of the time and place of the hearing must be sent by registered mail to the address shown on the plat. Public notice of all hearings also must be given. Every plat approved by the commission may be adopted by the commission as an amendment of or addition to the master plan without further hearing.

      Before the approval of a plat, the planning commission and the governing body shall take into consideration the prospective character of the development of the area included in the plat and of the surrounding territory. The owner of the land or the owner’s agent who files the plat may add as a part of the plat a notation to the effect that no offer or dedication of the streets, parks, or playgrounds shown thereon, or of any of them, is made to the public. The owner or the owner’s agent may show by a dotted line on the plat the dedication of an easement for building setback lines or for use in establishing public utility lines. At the time of the filing of the plat, the planning commission or the governing body may require that a deed to the fee for streets or other areas offered for dedication to the public on said plat be delivered to the municipality or county, as the case may be, where the same are located.

      The municipality shall not accept, lay out, open, improve, grade, pave, or curb any street, or lay or authorize the laying of sewers or connections in any street or right of way within any portion of territory for which the planning commission shall have adopted a major traffic street plan unless such street:

A street approved by the planning commission upon submission by the governing body or a street accepted by a two-thirds vote of the governing body after disapproval by the planning commission shall have the status of an approved street as fully as though it originally had been shown on the official master plan or on a subdivision plat approved by the planning commission or originally had been mapped by the commission.

     </h3>
     <p>
      After it has adopted any part of a master plan for any part of the territory within its planning jurisdiction, the planning commission may make or cause to be made, from time to time, surveys for the exact location of the lines of a street or streets shown in any portion of such master plan and may make a map of the land thus surveyed showing precisely the land which it recommends to be reserved for future acquisition for public streets. Before adopting any such map, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing thereon. A notice of the time and place of the hearing, with a general description of the district or area covered by the map, shall be given not less than ten days previous to the time fixed for the hearing by one publication in the official newspaper of the municipality if the district or area affected is within the municipality, and in a newspaper of general circulation in the county if the district or area affected is outside of the municipality. After such hearing, the commission may transmit the map as originally made, or as modified by it, to the governing body together with the commission’s estimate of the time or times within which the lands shown on the map as street locations should be acquired by the municipality. The governing body, by resolution, may approve and adopt or may reject such map, or it may modify the map with the approval of the planning commission, or in the event of the planning commission’s disapproval, the governing body by a favorable vote of not less than two-thirds of its entire membership, may modify such map and adopt the modified map. In the resolution adopting the map, the governing body shall fix the period of time for which the street locations shown upon the map shall be deemed reserved for future taking or acquisition. The city auditor shall file for record an attested copy of the map with the recorder of each county in which the mapped land is located and shall retain one copy for examination by the public.

      A board of park commissioners may provide for employees’ pensions pursuant to an authorized city pension plan with the consent of the city governing body and the consent of not less than a majority of the city employees covered by the city pension plan. In addition, a board of park commissioners may provide for employer pensions pursuant to chapter 54-52 or under a program approved by the internal revenue service. Payments made by employees or taxes levied by the park district must be paid into the employees’ pension fund. If a board of park commissioners wishes to leave an existing city pension plan, the board, upon the request of the pension fund governing body, shall fund an actuarial study of the financial impacts to the pension fund. Any losses or costs to the fund by the park district leaving the pension plan are the responsibility of the park district. A park district may not leave the city’s pension plan without the approval of the pension fund governing body.

    Laying out townsites, additions, and subdivisions — Survey and plat required — Contents of plat.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person desiring to lay out a townsite, an addition to a townsite, or a subdivision of land shall cause the land to be surveyed and a plat made of the land. The written plat must comply with the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol11">
       The plat must describe particularly and set forth all the streets, alleys, and public grounds, and all outlots or fractional lots within or adjoining the townsite or jurisdiction, together with the names, widths, courses, boundaries, and extent of all such streets, alleys, and public grounds, and giving the dimensions of all lots, streets, alleys, and public grounds.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol12">
       All lots and blocks, however designated, must be numbered in progressive numbers and their precise length, width, and area be stated on the map or plat. The streets, alleys, or roads which divide or border the lots must be shown on the map or plat.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol13">
       The plat must indicate that all outside boundary monuments have been set and indicate those interior monuments that have been set. There must be shown on the plat all survey and mathematical information, including bearings and distances, and data necessary to locate all monuments and to locate and retrace all interior and exterior boundary lines appearing on the plat. All interior lot lines and exterior boundary lines of the plat must be correctly designated on the plat and show bearings on all straight lines, or angles at all angle points, and central angle, radius, and arc length for all curves. All distances must be shown between all monuments as measured to the hundredth of a foot [0.3048 centimeter]. All lot distances must be shown on the plat to the nearest hundredth of a foot [0.3048 centimeter] and all curved lines within the plat must show central angles, radii, and arc distances. A north arrow and the scale of the plat must be shown on the plat. The scale must be of a dimension that the plat may be easily interpreted. If a curved line constitutes the line of more than one lot in any block of a plat, the central angle for that part of each lot on the curved line must be shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol14">
       Ditto marks may not be used on the plat for any purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol15">
       If a river, stream, creek, or lake constitutes a boundary line within or of the plat, a survey line must be shown with bearings or angles and distances between all angle points and their relation to a waterline, and all distances measured on the survey line between lot lines must be shown, and the survey line shown as a dashed line.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol16">
       The unadjusted outside boundary survey and the plat survey data must close by latitude and departure with an error that does not exceed one part in ten thousand parts.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol17">
       All rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, and all public highways, streets, and alleys of record must be correctly located and plainly shown and designated on the plat.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol18">
       The names and adjacent boundary lines of any adjoining platted lands must be dotted on the plat.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol19">
       The scale must be shown graphically and the basis of bearings must be shown. The plat must be dated as to the completion of the survey and preparation of the plat.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol110">
       The purpose of any easement shown on the plat must be clearly stated. Building setbacks may not be shown on the plat.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-01ol111">
       Any plat which includes lands abutting upon any lake, river, or stream must show a contour line denoting the present shoreline, water elevation, and the date of survey. If any part of a plat lies within the one hundred year floodplain of a lake, river, or stream as designated by the department of water resources or a federal agency, the mean sea level elevation of that one hundred year flood must be denoted on the plat by numerals. Topographic contours at a two-foot [60.96-centimeter] contour interval referenced to mean sea level must be shown for the portion of the plat lying within the floodplain. All elevations must be referenced to a durable benchmark described on the plat with its location and elevation to the nearest hundredth of a foot [0.3048 centimeter], which must be given in mean sea level datum.

The land intended to be used for the streets, alleys, ways, or other public uses in any jurisdiction or addition thereto must be held in the corporate name of the jurisdiction in trust for the uses and purposes set forth and expressed and intended.

       District court did not err in concluding as a matter of law that the original dedication of the streets was a statutory rather than a common law dedication. The streets were dedicated by way of a plat which was signed and acknowledged by the original owners of the land. Becker v. Burleigh Cty., 2019 ND 68, 924 N.W.2d 393, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under N.D.C.C. § 40-50.1-05, a developer’s dedication of the subdivision roads and public rights of way divested the developer of ownership in the roads where the plat for the subdivision declared that the developer donated and dedicated to the public any rights of way as hereon shown, for public use forever, each plat contained a full and accurate legal description of the property, a surveyor’s certificate, and the signature of the county commission chairperson approving the plat, nothing on the face of the plats indicated the county approved them on the condition it would not be responsible for maintenance of the roads, and the plats were recorded as required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-04" target="_self">40-50.1-04.</a></cite> Thus, an HOA’s motion for summary judgment on the developer’s trespass and negligence claims arising from the placement of water lines under the roads was properly granted.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A statutory dedication is in the nature of a grant and does not become effective until accepted by the grantee. Ramstad v. Carr, 31 N.D. 504, 154 N.W. 195, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of whether there has been an acceptance depends primarily upon whether there has been an intent to accept the offer to dedicate and acceptance may be express or implied and need not be by any formal act unless provided by statute. Ramstad v. Carr, 31 N.D. 504, 154 N.W. 195, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 1915); City of Grand Forks v. Flom, 79 N.D. 289, 56 N.W.2d 324, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite> (N.D. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        A plat owner’s dedication of streets and alleys is not complete until the public accepts the dedication and where the plat has not been incorporated within a municipality and there has been no use or improvement of the streets and alleys, the public has not accepted. Hille v. Nill, 58 N.D. 536, 226 N.W. 635, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1929).

       </h5>
       <p>
        By the platting, dedication and acceptance of a street, a city acquired the right to use the land so dedicated for street purposes; the fee to the center of the street remains in the abutting owner or owners. Donovan v. Allert, 11 N.D. 289, 91 N.W. 441, 58 L.R.A. 775, 95 Am. St. Rep. 720 (1902), decided prior to the adoption of Art. 1, § 16 of the N.D. Const.Gram Constr. Co. v. Minneapolis, S. P. &amp; S. S. M. Ry., 36 N.D. 164, 161 N.W. 732, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 1916); Casey v. Corwin, 71 N.W.2d 553, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

Grand Forks, 111 N.W.2d 513, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutes prescribing the method of dedicating real property to public uses are not exclusive of the common-law method of dedication, and do not abrogate the well-settled rule of implied dedication by estoppel in pais. Cole v. Minnesota Loan &amp; Trust Co., 17 N.D. 409, 117 N.W. 354, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        A city has the power to use, and control the use of, the entire area of a street for the benefit of the public in accordance with the powers vested in the city by statute. Kennedy v. Fargo, 40 N.D. 475, 169 N.W. 424, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1918); City of Jamestown v. Miemietz, 95 N.W.2d 897, 1959 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        The title to streets and alleys is held by the municipality in trust for the public, not in a proprietary capacity, and a municipality is without power to alienate the same, regardless of whether the corporation owns the fee or has merely an easement and it holds as trustee for the public.

        Where there is a dedication made by the statutory method of filing a plat, and a sale of lots by the owner with reference thereto, it can be withdrawn only by a vacation of the plat under the statute. Ramstad v. Carr, 31 N.D. 504, 154 N.W. 195, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 1915); City of Grand Forks v. Flom, 79 N.D. 289, 56 N.W.2d 324, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        The purchaser of a lot within the regularly platted portion of an incorporated city accepted its status as city property and could not change its classification by his usage except by vacation of that portion of the city plat where his property was located. EISENZIMMER v. BELL, 75 N.D. 733, 32 N.W.2d 891, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 99</cite> (N.D. 1948).

       Before the sale of lots, a plat, any part of a plat, a subdivision of land, or a townsite may be vacated by the proprietors by a written instrument declaring the plat to be vacated. The instrument must be signed, acknowledged or approved, and recorded in the office in which is recorded the instrument to be vacated. The signing and recording of that instrument destroys the force and effect of the recording of the plat which is so vacated and divests all public rights in the streets, alleys, easements, and public grounds laid out as described in the plat.

      <li id="t40c40-50.1s40-50.1-16ol12">
       If lots have been sold, a plat or any part of a plat may be vacated by all owners of the lots in the plat joining in the signing of the instrument declaring the vacation. Vacation of streets and public rights is not effective without endorsement by the governing body that has the power to approve the plat. The endorsement must indicate the public rights to be vacated.

       <p>
        Where there is a dedication made by the statutory method of filing a plat, and a sale of lots by the owner with reference thereto, it can be withdrawn only by a vacation of the plat under the statute. Ramstad v. Carr, 31 N.D. 504, 154 N.W. 195, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 1915); City of Grand Forks v. Flom, 79 N.D. 289, 56 N.W.2d 324, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Where the proprietor of a portion of a plat vacates it, the owner of other lots must act to vindicate the rights abridged or destroyed thereby within the prescriptive period. Hille v. Nill, 58 N.D. 536, 226 N.W. 635, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1929).

        Where a city has improved streets and alleys and has done other acts of a public nature within part of a plat attempted to be vacated, the city has acquired rights of which it cannot be deprived, at least without its consent.

An agreement is binding on the governing bodies of the cities for the term of the agreement unless the governing bodies agree otherwise or unless determined otherwise by an administrative law judge in accordance with this chapter. An agreement may not have a term greater than twenty years.

      Upon a petition signed by not less than three-fourths of the qualified electors and by the owners of not less than three-fourths in assessed value of the property in any territory within the limits of an incorporated municipality and contiguous or adjacent to such limits, the governing body of the municipality, by ordinance, may in its discretion, disconnect and exclude such territory from the municipality. This section, however, applies only to lands that have not been platted under either sections 40-50.1-01 through 40-50.1-17 or section 57-02-39, and where no municipal improvements have been made or constructed therein or adjacent thereto. Further, in the event any property for which exclusion is petitioned has been within the limits of an incorporated municipality for more than ten years prior thereto and, as of the time of filing the petition, is not platted and has no municipal improvements thereon, the governing body of the municipality may disconnect and exclude such territory by ordinance from the municipality.

An annexation is effective for the purpose of general taxation on and after the first day of the next January. However, the city shall continue to classify as agricultural lands for tax purposes all lands in the annexed area which were classified as agricultural lands immediately before the annexation proceedings until those lands are put to another use.

       The governing body of any city may adopt a resolution to annex contiguous or adjacent territory as follows:

         The governing body of the city shall adopt a resolution describing the property to be annexed. Within seven days of the adoption of a resolution under this subdivision, the governing body shall mail, by certified mail, a copy of the resolution to the owner of each parcel of real property within the area to be annexed at the person’s last-known mailing address.
        </li>
        <li id="t40c40-51.2s40-51.2-07ol11b">
         The governing body of the city shall publish the resolution and a notice of the time and place the governing body will meet to hear and determine the sufficiency of any written protests against the proposed annexation in the official newspaper once each week for two consecutive weeks. At least fifteen days before the meeting, the governing body of the city shall mail, by certified mail, a notice to the owner of each parcel of real property within the area to be annexed at the person’s last-known mailing address. The notice must inform landowners of the resolution, the time and place of hearing, and the requirement that protests must be filed in writing. The owners of any real property within the territory proposed to be annexed may file written protests with the city auditor protesting against the proposed annexation within thirty days of the first publication of the resolution. The governing body of the city also shall mail at least seven days before the meeting, by certified mail, the notice of the time and place of the hearing to the governing body of each city, county, or township directly affected by the land area proposed to be annexed. No state-owned property may be annexed without the written consent of the state agency or department having control of the property. The governing body of the city, at its next meeting after the expiration of the time for filing the protests, shall hear and determine the sufficiency of the protests.

         In the absence of protests filed by the owners of more than one-fourth of the territory proposed to be annexed as of the date of the adoption of the resolution, the territory described in the resolution becomes a part of the city. When a copy of the resolution and an accurate map of the annexed area, certified by the executive officer of the city, are filed and recorded with the county recorder, the annexation becomes effective. Annexation is effective for the purpose of general taxation on and after the first day of the next January. However, the city shall continue to classify as agricultural lands for tax purposes all lands in the annexed area which were classified as agricultural lands immediately before the annexation proceedings until those lands are put to another use.

      <li id="t40c40-51.2s40-51.2-07ol12">
       If the owners of one-fourth or more of the territory proposed to be annexed protest, or if a city that has extraterritorial zoning or subdivision regulation authority over the area petitioned to be annexed protests, the city may either stop its pursuit of the annexation or submit the matter to a committee for mediation as provided in section 40-51.2-07.1.

        Nothing in this chapter precludes a municipality from defeating its annexation resolution without submitting the matter to an annexation review commission and then, if petitioned by the landowners, adopting an ordinance to annex the same land.

        The statute authorizing the annexation of territory adjacent to a city is not objectionable on the ground that it is not uniform in operation, or that it is special legislation, and the statute does not deprive the people of the annexed territory of the right of local self-government, and does not delegate legislative power.

        Where an original resolution was amended, after protest, so as to include less territory, and the territory included in the amended resolution was declared annexed without the publication of notice of the amendment or the proposed annexation, the annexation was rendered invalid.

        The purpose of giving notice so that whosoever may be affected by the proposed action may object, was satisfied by a resolution referring to the block, addition, township, county and state, the property having been previously platted and the plat duly filed and recorded.

        Where it was shown that on whatever theory of ownership the “property owners” were counted, those who protested were still less than three-fourths when the same theory was used in counting both owners and those protesting, then the requirements of the statute were met.

        The manner of computing the number of signers of the protesting petition is not a jurisdictional question, hence it is not the subject of review by the supreme court in a case where notice was given and a hearing was held by the annexation review commission.

      On or before the fifteenth day of March in each year, the city auditor of each city within the state may at the discretion of the governing board advertise in the official newspaper once each week for two consecutive weeks for bids for the furnishing of gravel in place for gravel surfacing of highways within the city, upon a cubic yard [0.76 cubic meter] basis. The bids must be made in accordance with such specifications as to type, grade, and quality of material as specified by the city engineer and approved by the governing board and must provide for the delivery of such gravel along such streets of the city as may thereafter be designated, in such manner as may be designated in the specifications. The notice must specify that payment for such gravel will be in cash or by special assessment warrants issued against the graveling special assessment fund created by this chapter and each bid must specify the lowest rate of interest that the bidder will accept upon such warrants and that payment for such gravel will be accepted by the bidder in the manner herein provided. Each bid must be accompanied by a separate envelope containing a certified or cashier’s check in such amount as may be fixed by the governing board and the award of the contract shall be made only to such person who shall furnish good and sufficient bond for the performance thereof, in such amount as shall be fixed by the governing board at the time of calling for bids.

       The governing body of a city may, and upon receipt of a petition signed by at least ten qualified electors but not less than five percent of those qualified electors who voted at the last general election of the city shall, submit to the qualified electors the question of approval or disapproval of voter-approved levy authority for establishment, maintenance, and conduct of a public recreation system at the next general election or special municipal election if the question to be placed on the ballot is filed thirty days prior to the date of the election. The ballot measure question to approve a levy under this section must be stated to ask if the elector approves a voter-approved tax by the city for a public recreation system in a stated number of mills, not exceeding six mills. If approved by a majority of city electors voting on the question, the city may levy an additional tax within the limitation of subsection 13 of section 57-15-10. After January 1, 2015, approval or reauthorization by electors of voter-approved levy authority under this section may not be effective for more than ten taxable years. Any voter-approved levy under this section or section 40-55-08 approved by the electors of a city before January 1, 2015, remains effective for ten taxable years or the period of time for which it was approved by the electors after it was approved, whichever is less, under the provisions of law in effect at the time it was approved. The governing body of the city shall discontinue the levy for public recreation purposes if the qualified voters, at a regular or special election, by a majority vote on the proposition, decide to discontinue the levy. A vote of the qualified electors is not required to discontinue the levy under this section if the levy authority is no longer required as a result of a merger between a park district and a city public recreation system.

     <p>
      The acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, betterment, extension, or financing of any project, and the issue of bonds in anticipation of the collection of the revenues of the project to provide funds to pay for the cost of the project, may be authorized by an ordinance or resolution of the governing body adopted at a regular or special meeting of the governing body by the affirmative vote of a majority of its members. Before the issuance of revenue bonds under this chapter, the governing body shall give notice and hold a public hearing on the proposed bond issue. Notice of the hearing must be published in the official newspaper of the municipality once a week for two successive weeks before the time set for the hearing. The notice must specify the time and place of the hearing, and the amount and purpose of the proposed bond issue. The governing body may not approve the bond issue unless it appears, after the public hearing, that approval is in the public interest of the municipality. No election is required to authorize the use of any of the powers conferred by this chapter. No public hearing is required before the issuance of refunding bonds issued under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-57s40-57-19" target="_self">40-57-19.</a></cite>1.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly declares and finds that it is and has been its purpose in preparing and adopting the provisions of this chapter to sanction, authorize, and encourage activities in the public interest and for the welfare of the state, its subdivisions, and people by assisting in the establishment of additional industrial plants, the expansion and retention of existing business, and promotion of economic activities within the state and thereby increasing production of wealth and adding to the volume of employment, particularly during those seasons when employment in farming and ranching is slack, thus alleviating unemployment among the people of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislative assembly that political subdivisions and the state board of equalization in their determination of whether the tax exemptions authorized by this chapter shall be granted shall give due weight to their impact and effect upon existing industry and business to the end that an unfair advantage shall not be given to new or expanded enterprises which is to the substantial detriment of existing enterprises.

       “Local development organization”, as used in section 40-57.1-04.3, means a profit or nonprofit corporation incorporated under the laws of this state or a limited liability company organized under the laws of this state, formed for the purpose of furthering the economic development of its community and environs, with authority to promote and assist the growth and development of business concerns in the areas covered by its operations. The operations of the corporation or limited liability company must be limited to a specified area in this state. The controlling interest in the corporation or limited liability company must be held by at least twenty-five persons residing or doing business in the community or its environs. These persons must control not less than seventy-five percent of the voting control of the corporation or limited liability company. No shareholder or member of the corporation or limited liability company may own in excess of twenty-five percent of the voting control in the corporation or limited liability company if that shareholder or member has a direct pecuniary interest in any project or business concern which will occupy the property of the corporation or limited liability company. The primary objective of the corporation or limited liability company must be to benefit the community through increased employment, payroll, business volume, and corresponding factors rather than monetary profits to its shareholders or members. Any monetary profits or other benefits going to the shareholders or members must be merely incidental to the primary objective of the corporation or limited liability company.

       After negotiation with a potential project operator, a municipality may grant a partial or complete exemption from ad valorem taxation on all buildings, structures, fixtures, and improvements used in or necessary to the operation of a project for a period not exceeding five years from the date of commencement of project operations. A municipality may also grant a partial or complete exemption from ad valorem taxation on buildings, structures, fixtures, and improvements used in or necessary to the operation of a project that produces or manufactures a product from agricultural commodities for all or part of the sixth year through the tenth year from the date of commencement of project operations.

       In addition to, or in lieu of, a property tax exemption granted under this section, a municipality may establish an amount due as payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes on buildings, structures, fixtures, and improvements used in the operation of a project. The governing body of the municipality shall designate the amount of the payments for each year and the beginning year and the concluding year for payments in lieu of taxes, but the option to make payments in lieu of taxes under this section may not extend beyond the twentieth year from the date of commencement of project operations. To establish the amount of payments in lieu of taxes, the governing body of the municipality may use actual or estimated levels of assessment and taxation or may establish payment amounts based on other factors. The governing body of the municipality may designate different amounts of payments in lieu of taxes in different years to recognize future project expansion plans or other considerations.

Upon receipt by the county treasurer of the amount of payments in lieu of taxes under this section, the county treasurer shall apportion and distribute that amount to taxing districts on the basis on which the general real estate tax levy is apportioned and distributed. The municipality may enter into a written agreement with the local school district and any other local taxing districts that wish to enter the agreement for an alternate method of apportionment and distribution. If such an agreement is entered into, the county treasurer shall apportion and distribute the money according to the written agreement. All provisions of law relating to enforcement, administration, collection, penalties, and delinquency proceedings for ad valorem taxes apply to payments in lieu of taxes under this section. However, the discount for early payment of taxes under section 57-20-09 does not apply to payments in lieu of taxes under this section.

A partial exemption must be stated as a percentage of the total ad valorem taxes assessed against the property. Unless the governing body of the municipality determines that there is no existing business within the municipality for which the potential project would be a competitor, the potential project operator shall publish two notices to competitors, the form of which must be prescribed by the tax commissioner, of the application for tax exemption or payments in lieu of taxes in the official newspaper of the municipality at least one week apart. The publications must be completed not less than fifteen nor more than thirty days before the governing body of the municipality is to consider the application.

      Upon application by a project operator to the state board of equalization, the net income of a project may be exempt from state income tax for a period not exceeding five years from commencement of project operations. The application for the exemption must be reviewed as to the eligibility of the project by the department of commerce division of economic development and finance and its recommendations forwarded to the state board of equalization. The project operator shall provide notice to competitors in the manner prescribed by the state board of equalization. The board shall determine whether the granting of the exemption is in the best interest of the people of North Dakota and, if it so determines, approve the exemption. The board shall, after making its determination, certify the findings back to the applicant and to the tax commissioner. Nothing contained herein shall have the effect of exempting the project from filing an annual income tax return.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a project operator who otherwise qualifies under this chapter may, upon application consistent with the provisions of this chapter, receive a partial or complete exemption from ad valorem taxation on any existing structure used in or necessary to the operation of the project for a period not exceeding five years from the date of commencement of project operations in the structure. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1988, the governing body of a municipality may grant additional exemptions of property under this section during a period not exceeding ten years from the date of commencement of project operations in the structure if the structure is owned by the United States, the state, or a political subdivision of the state and leased to the project operator. The project operator shall apply to the governing body of the municipality annually for the exemption and the governing body of the municipality may grant the exemption for only one year at a time.

    Property tax exemption on speculative industrial buildings and properties owned by a local development organization.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A municipality may, in its discretion, grant partial or complete exemption from ad valorem taxation on buildings, structures, and improvements constructed and owned by a local development organization for the express purpose of attracting new industry to this state. This exemption from ad valorem taxation is only available on new buildings, structures, and improvements while they remain unoccupied. Once the building, structure, or improvement is occupied, the exemption continues until the next annual assessment date following the first occupancy. This section does not affect the eligibility for property tax exemption of a business available under other provisions of this chapter, provided application for the tax exemption is granted prior to occupancy. A written request for the exemption is to be filed by the local development organization with the municipality. The request will be reviewed at an official meeting of the governing body and will be placed on the agenda for final action at the next official meeting. The governing body of the municipality shall notify the county director of tax equalization with respect to any exemption granted under this section.

      If the capital investment in the buildings, structures, fixtures, and improvements comprising the project exceeds the original investment or total investment after an approved reapplication under this section because expansion of the project has increased the investment in the project by more than twenty percent, the project operator must reapply to receive an exemption or to make payments in lieu of taxes on the added value of the property. If the project operator does not reapply, or if the reapplication is disapproved, the increased capital value of the buildings, structures, fixtures, and improvements comprising the project is subject to ad valorem taxation. If at any time a project operator who is exempt from taxation or subject to payments in lieu of taxes under this chapter moves the business to a new location, the project operator must reapply to retain the remaining balance of the property tax exemption or the option to make payments in lieu of taxes or elect to make application as a new business. A business relocation has no effect on the income tax exemption of the project operator if it is shown by the project operator to the satisfaction of the state board of equalization that the nature of the business has not been changed by the move and that the effect of the business upon competitors has not been changed by the move. In addition, a property tax exemption or option to make payments in lieu of taxes provided by this chapter applies only to the project operator to whom it is granted and is valid only while the property is used for the purposes stated in the application.

     <p>
      In addition to the tax under section 40-57.3-01, the governing body of any city, by ordinance, may impose a city tax, at a rate not to exceed one percent, upon the gross receipts of retailers on the leasing or renting of hotel, motel, or other accommodations within the city for periods of fewer than thirty consecutive calendar days or one month and upon the gross receipts of a restaurant from any sales of prepared food or beverages, not including alcoholic beverages for consumption off the premises where purchased, which are subject to state sales taxes. For purposes of this section, “restaurant” means any place where food is prepared and intended for individual portion service for consumption on or off the premises and “prepared” includes heating prepackaged food. Accommodations, food, and beverages may all, each, or in any combination be subject to the tax under this section, if all items in any category which are taxable under state law are taxable, except as otherwise provided in this section. The tax imposed under this section is in addition to state sales taxes on rental accommodations and restaurant sales and any city that imposes the tax under this section shall deposit all proceeds in the city visitors’ promotion capital construction fund. Moneys deposited in the city visitors’ promotion capital construction fund must be spent only as provided in this chapter. An ordinance adopted under this section may not become effective sooner than sixty days after it is adopted by the governing body of the city. The provisions of chapter 40-12 with regard to referral of ordinances apply to an ordinance adopted under this section except that a petition to refer an ordinance adopted under this section must be presented to the governing body of the municipality before four p.m. on the sixty-fourth day after the ordinance described in the petition was adopted by the governing body of the municipality. Revenues from a tax imposed under this section may not be pledged under section 40-57.3-03 to payment of bonds or evidences of indebtedness until after the time has passed for filing a referral petition against an ordinance under this section or, if a referral petition is filed, until after the referral petition has been submitted to the vote of the electors of the municipality.

      The governing body of a city, by resolution, may create a job development authority for the city, or may discontinue a job development authority which has been created for the city. Before a resolution is adopted to create a city job development authority, the governing body of the city shall hold a public hearing to provide interested persons an opportunity to be heard. Notice of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing must be published not less than thirty days prior to the hearing in the official newspaper of the city. If the authority is created, the question of discontinuing the authority may be placed on the ballot at the next regular election by petition signed by electors of the city equal in number to ten percent of the votes cast in the city for the office of governor in the last general election. The petition must be presented to the governing body of the city not later than thirty days after the adoption of the resolution creating the city job development authority. The question of discontinuing the authority requires a majority of the electors voting on the question for passage. If the authority is created, the governing body of the city shall appoint a board of directors. The members must be appointed without regard to political affiliation and upon their fitness to serve as members by reason of character, experience, and training.

      The governing body of a city which has a city job development authority shall establish a city job development authority fund and may levy a tax not exceeding the limitation in subsection 12 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-15s57-15-10" target="_blank">57-15-10.</a></cite> In the year for which the levy is sought, a job development authority or industrial development organization seeking approval of a property tax levy under this chapter must file with the city auditor, at a time and in a format prescribed by the city auditor, a financial report for the preceding calendar year showing the ending balances of each fund held by the job development authority or industrial development organization during that year. The city auditor shall keep the job development authority fund separate from other money of the city and transmit all funds received under this section within thirty days to the board of directors of the city job development authority. The funds when paid to the city job development authority must be deposited in a special account in which other revenues of the city job development authority are deposited and may be expended by the city job development authority as provided in sections 40-57.4-02 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-57.4s40-57.4-03" target="_self">40-57.4-03.</a></cite>

     <p>
      The governing bodies of a city and one or more other political subdivisions, by resolution, may create a joint job development authority. If the authority is created, the governing bodies of the political subdivisions shall appoint a board of directors in the size and manner established in the resolution. The resolution must include provision for discontinuing the authority by the governing bodies. If the authority is created, the question of discontinuing the authority may be placed on the ballot at the next regular election by a petition signed by qualified electors of a political subdivision within the authority equal in number to ten percent of the votes cast in that political subdivision for the office of governor at the last general election. The question to discontinue the authority requires a majority of the electors voting on the question in that political subdivision for passage. If a majority of the electors voting on the question vote to discontinue the authority in a political subdivision creating the authority, the authority is discontinued. A joint job development authority in which a city is participating may exercise any of the functions and powers of a city job development authority under this chapter.

       It is hereby found and declared that there exist in municipalities of the state slum and blighted areas which constitute a serious and growing menace, injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the state; that the existence of these areas contributes substantially and increasingly to the spread of disease and crime, constitutes an economic and social liability, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of municipalities, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems, and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; and that the prevention and elimination of slums and blight is a matter of state policy and state concern in order that the state and its municipalities do not continue to be endangered by areas which are focal centers of disease, promote juvenile delinquency, and, while contributing little to the tax income of the state and its municipalities, consume an excessive proportion of its revenues because of the extra services required for police, fire, accident, hospitalization, and other forms of public protection, services, and facilities. It is further found and declared that certain slum or blighted areas, or portions thereof, may require acquisition, clearance, and disposition subject to use restrictions, as provided in this chapter, since the prevailing condition of decay may make impracticable the reclamation of the area by conservation or rehabilitation; that other areas or portions thereof may, through the means provided in this chapter, be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner that the conditions and evils described in this section may be eliminated, remedied, or prevented; and that to the extent feasible salvable slum and blighted areas should be conserved and rehabilitated through voluntary action and the regulatory process.

       Because the record did not reflect that a city passed an appropriate resolution for a substantial change either at the original city commission meeting or at a continued meeting, remand was necessary to resolve whether there was an appropriate resolution to add additional city blocks to a renewal area. If there was not an appropriate resolution, then the city was precluded from diverting tax increment funds for those additional blocks for the period from the original modification to the subsequent modification.

       A municipality may sell, lease, or otherwise transfer real property or any interest in real property acquired by it, and may enter into contracts with respect to the real property, in a development or renewal area for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial, or other uses or for public use, or may retain the property or interest for public use, in accordance with the development or renewal plan, subject to such covenants, conditions, and restrictions, including covenants running with the land, as it may deem to be necessary or desirable to assist in preventing the development or spread of future slums or blighted areas, to facilitate the development of industrial or commercial properties, or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this chapter; provided, that the sale, lease, other transfer, or retention, and any agreement relating thereto, may be made only after the approval of the development or renewal plan by the governing body. The purchasers or lessees and their successors and assigns must be obligated to devote the real property only to the uses specified in the development or renewal plan, and may be obligated to comply with any other requirements that the municipality determines are in the public interest, including the obligation to begin within a reasonable time any improvements on the real property required by the development or renewal plan. The real property or interest must be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or retained at not less than its fair value for uses in accordance with the development or renewal plan. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the development or renewal plan, a municipality shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in the plan; the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions, and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee or by the municipality retaining the property; and the objectives of the plan for the development of industrial or commercial properties and the prevention of the recurrence of slum or blighted areas. The municipality in any instrument of conveyance to a private purchaser or lessee may provide that the purchaser or lessee may not sell, lease, or otherwise transfer the real property without the prior written consent of the municipality until the purchaser or lessee has completed the construction of any and all improvements which the purchaser or lessee is obligated to construct on the real property. Real property acquired by a municipality which, in accordance with the provisions of the development or renewal plan, is to be transferred, must be transferred as rapidly as feasible in the public interest consistent with the carrying out of the provisions of the development or renewal plan. The inclusion in any contract or conveyance to a purchaser or lessee of any such covenants, restrictions, or conditions, including the incorporation by reference of the provisions of a development or renewal plan or any part of the plan, does not prevent the filing of the contract or conveyance in the land records of the recorder in a manner that affords actual or constructive notice of the contract or conveyance.

The bonds may also be sold at private sale if the obligations do not exceed the total sum of one hundred thousand dollars.

       A municipality may itself exercise its urban renewal project powers, as defined by this section, or may, if the governing body by resolution determines the action to be in the public interest, elect to have those powers exercised by the urban renewal agency created by section 40-58-16 or by the housing authority, if one exists or is subsequently established in the community. In the event the governing body makes that determination, the urban renewal agency or the housing authority, as the case may be, is vested with all of the urban renewal project powers in the same manner as though those powers were conferred on the agency or authority instead of the municipality. However, an urban renewal agency or housing authority may not exercise any rights, powers, functions, and duties of a municipality under this chapter which relate to the development of industrial or commercial property under section 40-58-20.1. If the governing body does not elect to make a determination under this subsection, the municipality may exercise its urban renewal project powers through a board or commissioner or through any officers of the municipality as the governing body may by resolution determine.

       There is created in each municipality a public body corporate and politic to be known as the “urban renewal agency” of the municipality; provided, that the agency may not transact any business or exercise its powers under this chapter until or unless the local governing body has made the finding prescribed in section 40-58-05 and has elected to have the urban renewal project powers exercised by an urban renewal agency as provided in section 40-58-15.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-58s40-58-16ol12">
       If the urban renewal agency is authorized to transact business and exercise powers under this chapter, the mayor, by and with the advice and consent of the local governing body, shall appoint a board of commissioners of the urban renewal agency which must consist of five commissioners. The term of office of each commissioner is one year.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-58s40-58-16ol13">
       A commissioner may not receive compensation for services but is entitled to the necessary expenses, including traveling expenses, incurred in the discharge of the commissioner’s duties. Each commissioner shall hold office until a successor has been appointed and has qualified. A certificate of the appointment or reappointment of any commissioner must be filed with the clerk of the municipality and the certificate is conclusive evidence of the due and proper appointment of the commissioner.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-58s40-58-16ol14">
       The powers of an urban renewal agency must be exercised by the commissioners of the agency. A majority of the commissioners constitutes a quorum for the purpose of conducting business and exercising the powers of the agency and for all other purposes. Action may be taken by the agency upon a vote of a majority of the commissioners present, unless in any case the bylaws require a larger number. Approval of the payment of an account or claim must be recorded in the record of the agency’s proceedings and this is sufficient to indicate approval without requiring a majority of the commissioners to sign or initial the voucher or order for payment.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-58s40-58-16ol15">
       Any persons may be appointed as commissioners if they reside within the area of operation of the agency which shall be coterminous with the area of operation of the municipality and are otherwise eligible for appointments under this chapter. The mayor shall designate a chairman and vice chairman from among the commissioners. An agency may employ an executive director, technical experts, and such other agents and employees, permanent and temporary, as it may require, and determine their qualifications, duties, and compensation. For legal services it may require, an agency may employ or retain its own counsel and legal staff. An agency authorized to transact business and exercise powers under this chapter shall file, with the local governing body, on or before March thirty-first of each year a report of its activities for the preceding calendar year, which report must include a complete financial statement setting forth its assets, liabilities, income, and operating expense as of the end of the calendar year. At the time of filing the report, the agency shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the community a notice to the effect that the report has been filed with the municipality and that the report is available for inspection during business hours in the office of the auditor and in the office of the agency.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-58s40-58-16ol16">
       For inefficiency or neglect of duty or misconduct in office, a commissioner may be removed only after a hearing and after the commissioner has been given a copy of the charges at least ten days prior to the hearing and has had an opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel.

The complaint must contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the public officer or the public officer’s designated agent at a place designated in the complaint not less than ten days nor more than thirty days after the serving of the complaint; that the owner, mortgagee, and parties in interest must be given the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time designated in the complaint; and that the rules of evidence are not controlling in hearings before the public officer.

         The amount of the cost of any repairs, alterations, or improvements, or vacating and closing, or removal or demolition by the public officer constitutes a lien against the real property upon which the cost was incurred and the lien, including an allowance of the public officer’s costs and necessary attorney’s fees, may be foreclosed in judicial proceedings in the manner provided by law for loans secured by liens on real property. If the dwelling is removed or demolished by the public officer, the public officer shall sell the materials of the dwelling and credit the proceeds of the sale against the cost of the removal or demolition. Any balance remaining must be paid to the parties entitled to it as determined by proper judicial proceedings instituted by the public officer after deducting the costs of the judicial proceedings, including necessary attorney’s fees incurred in those proceedings by the public officer, as determined by the court.

Those conditions may include defects in the dwelling increasing the hazards of fire, accident, or other calamities; lack of adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities; dilapidation; disrepair; structural defects; uncleanliness; overcrowding; inadequate ingress and egress; inadequate drainage; or any violation of health, fire, building, or zoning regulations, or any other laws or regulations relating to the use of land and the use and occupancy of building and improvements.

A copy of the complaint or order must be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises affected by the complaint or order. A copy of the complaint or order must also be filed with the clerk of the county in which the dwelling is located and the filing of the complaint or order has the same force and effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law.

Hearings must be held by the court on the petitions within twenty days, or as soon thereafter as possible, and must be given preference over other matters on the court’s calendar. The court shall hear and determine the issues raised and enter a final order or decree in the proceeding. In the proceeding, the findings of the public officer as to facts, if supported by evidence, are conclusive. The court may assess costs. The remedies provided under this section are exclusive remedies and a person affected by an order of the public officer may not recover any damages for action taken pursuant to any order of the public officer, or because of compliance by that person with any order of the public officer.

       At any time after the governing body of a municipality has approved a development or renewal plan for any development or renewal area and has filed that plan with the department of commerce division of community services, it may request the county auditor and treasurer to compute, certify, and remit tax increments resulting from the development or renewal of the area in accordance with the plan and any modifications thereof, and the county auditor and treasurer shall do so in accordance with this section.

         For a tax increment district established before July 1, 2011, the base year for tax increments computed for a development or renewal area under this section or section 40-58-20.1 may not be used for more than twenty-five taxable years without the governing body of the municipality establishing a new base year using taxable values, established as of February first of the following year, which are not more than fifteen years old. Regardless of length of the initial district, the new base year may be used to compute tax increments for up to an additional fifteen years after which time the tax increment district must be closed, except that the original base year for tax increments pledged for an indebtedness incurred before July 1, 2011, may continue until the indebtedness is paid.

       The auditor shall compute and certify the original taxable value of each lot and parcel of real estate in the area, as last assessed and equalized before the date of the request, including the taxable value of any lot or parcel previously acquired by the municipality or its urban renewal agency, as last assessed and equalized before it was acquired. However, any real property acquired by the city or the city’s urban renewal agency prior to July 1, 1973, or more than five years prior to the approval of a development or renewal plan for any development or renewal area, whichever is later, is deemed to have an original taxable value of zero and the county auditor shall so certify.

       In each subsequent year, the auditor shall compute and certify the net amount by which the original taxable value of all lots and parcels of real estate in the area, as then assessed and equalized, including real estate then held by the municipality or urban renewal agency valued at zero, has increased or decreased in comparison with the original taxable value of all such real estate. The net amount of the increase or decrease is referred to in this section as the incremental value or the lost value for that year, as the case may be.

However, the auditor shall extend the aggregate mill rate of those taxes against the incremental value as well as the original taxable value, and the amount of taxes received from that extension against the incremental value is referred to in this section as the tax increment for that year.

The amounts so computed are referred to in this section as the tax losses for that year.

       The county auditor shall segregate all tax increments from the development or renewal area in a special fund, crediting to the fund, in each year when there is an incremental value, that proportion of each collection of taxes on real estate within the area which the incremental value bears to the total taxable value in that year.

Thereafter, at the time of each distribution, the county treasurer shall remit the entire balance then on hand in the fund to the municipality, until the cost of development or renewal of the area has been reimbursed to the municipality as provided in this section.

From the total cost to be reimbursed there must be deducted, except as provided below, all amounts received from the federal government or others, and all special assessments, revenues, and other receipts except property taxes, which are actually collected and applied to the payment of the cost or the bonds, notes, or other obligations, at the times when those payments are due. However, if the proceeds of tax increments or of bonds, notes, or other obligations are loaned to finance part or all of the cost of a project comprising the restoration, reconstruction, and improvement of a privately owned state historical site situated within the development or renewal area or any buildings or structures thereon, as contemplated in section 55-10-08, or of a property listed in the national register of historic places, as contemplated in section 55-10-11, in consideration of the grant to the city of a historic easement with respect thereto, repayments of the loan may not be deducted from the cost of development or renewal subject to reimbursement.

When special improvement warrants or refunding improvement bonds are issued to pay the cost of public improvements of special benefit to properties within the development or renewal area, the governing body may cause those special benefits to be computed, together with the cost properly assessable against those properties, and may appropriate the tax increments from the area to the payment of that cost, in lieu of levying special assessments upon the property. In this event, the amount so appropriated, divided into the same number of installments as the special assessments and with interest at the same rate on the declining balance thereof, is deemed a part of the special assessments appropriated for payment of the cost, within the meaning of section 40-26-08.

       When the cost of development or renewal of any development or renewal area has been fully paid and all bonds, notes, or other obligations issued by the municipality to pay that cost have been retired, or funds sufficient for the retirement thereof have been received by the municipality, the governing body shall cause this to be reported to the county auditor, who shall thereafter compute the mill rates of all taxes upon the total taxable value of the development or renewal area. Any balance then on hand in the tax increment fund must be distributed by the county treasurer to the state and all political subdivisions having power to tax property in the area, in amounts proportionate to the amounts of the tax losses previously reimbursed to them.

       As an alternative to the sale of bonds to be amortized with tax increments as provided in this section, the governing body of a municipality may, in its discretion, grant a total or partial tax exemption for the project in order to provide assistance to a project developer in a development or renewal area, pursuant to agreement with the municipality. However, if a developer of a development or renewal project receives a tax exemption for that project pursuant to this subsection, that project developer may not receive a tax exemption for that project under section 40-57.1-03, 40-57.1-04, 40-57.1-04.1, or 40-57.1-04.3. The amount of annual tax exemption under this subsection is limited to the tax increment as defined in this section as it applies to the development or renewal project and may extend for a period not to exceed fifteen years. In determining the total amount of the tax exemption to be authorized, the municipality shall give due consideration to the same elements as are involved in the sale of bonds to be amortized by tax increments. The amount to be reimbursed, by tax exemption, to the project developer must be all or a portion of eligible public costs which have been paid by the project developer, plus interest on those costs at a rate not to exceed ten percent per annum. The amount of tax exemption must be an amount sufficient to reimburse the project operator for those eligible costs, amortized pursuant to the agreement between the project developer and the municipality.

       The governing body of a municipality with an active tax increment financing district may at any time identify funds on hand that are in excess of the costs it determines necessary to complete the activities included in the last approved urban renewal plan for that district. The governing body shall cause the identified surplus to be transferred to the county treasurer to be distributed to the state and all political subdivisions having power to tax property in the area, in amounts proportionate to the most recent five-year average of the property tax levy within the district.

     </h3>
     <p>
      To alleviate traffic congestion in municipalities, prevent the development of blight, and implement orderly plans for urban development and urban renewal, it is necessary that adequate and suitable space be reserved, particularly in central business areas, for parking facilities; which phrase is defined to include, but without limitation, all offstreet lots, sites, parking meters and other control devices, garages, ramps, and other structures and accessories, both aboveground and belowground, which are used or useful for the parking, delivery, fueling and servicing of automobiles and other motor vehicles, the collection of charges therefor, and the convenience of the patrons of the facilities. The withdrawal of a disproportionate amount of land for this purpose from use for commercial development and from the tax base of municipalities is undesirable and can be avoided, when the growth of business areas makes it economically feasible, by the construction of multilevel parking ramps and garages, and by making the space above, below, or adjacent thereto available for commercial development and use. It is the policy and purpose of the state to authorize and encourage municipal action, and cooperation of municipalities with public and private persons, firms, corporations, and limited liability companies in the acquisition, construction, improvement, development, extension, financing, operation, maintenance, and leasing of parking facilities, and of commercially usable space therein and adjacent thereto for the purposes and by the methods described in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t40c40-60s40-60-02" target="_self">40-60-02.</a></cite>

     <p>
      Any city may create a board to be known as a municipal parking authority. Such board shall be a body corporate, constituting a public benefit corporation, and its existence shall commence upon the appointment of the members as herein provided. It shall consist of a chairman and four other members, who shall be appointed by the governing body of the city. Three members of the board shall be property owners within the benefited areas and two members of the board shall be guarantors of the bonds of the authority if any have been issued and guaranteed by property owners. If the authority has not issued bonds or if property owners have not guaranteed said bonds as hereinafter provided, then two members may be appointed at large. Of the members first appointed, one shall be appointed for a period of one year, one for a period of two years, one for a period of three years, one for a period of four years, and one for a period of five years. At the expiration of such terms, the terms of office of their successors shall be five years. Each member shall continue to serve until the appointment and qualification of the member’s successor. Vacancies in such board occurring otherwise than by the expiration of term shall be filled for the unexpired term. The members of the board shall choose from their number a vice chairman. The governing body of the city may remove any member of the board for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or misconduct in office, giving that member a copy of the charges against that member and an opportunity of being heard in person, or by counsel, in that member’s defense upon not less than ten days’ notice. The members of the board shall be entitled to no compensation for their services but shall be entitled to reimbursement for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties. The powers of the authority shall be vested in and exercised by a majority of the members of the board then in office. Such board may delegate to one or more of its members or to its officers, agents, and employees such powers and duties as it may deem proper. Such board and the corporate existence of the authority shall continue until all its liabilities have been met and its bonds have been paid in full or such liabilities or bonds have otherwise been discharged and until the existence of the authority is terminated by official action of the governing body of the city. Upon its ceasing to exist, all its rights and properties shall pass to the city.

     <p>
      An authority shall let contracts for construction in the same manner, so far as practicable, as is provided by law for contracts of cities except that if the estimated expense of a contract does not exceed five hundred dollars, such contract may be entered into without public letting. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the power of an authority to do any construction directly by the officers, agents, and employees of the authority.

      All moneys of an authority shall be paid to the city auditor as agent of the authority, who shall not commingle such moneys with any other moneys. Such moneys shall be deposited in a separate bank account or accounts. The moneys in such accounts shall be paid out by the auditor on requisition of the chairman of the authority or of such other person or persons as the authority may authorize to make such requisitions after audit by the auditor. Approval of the payment of an account or claim shall be recorded in the record of the proceedings of the authority and this shall be sufficient to indicate approval without requiring the approving members to sign or initial the voucher or order for payment. All deposits of such moneys shall, if required by the auditor or the authority, be secured by obligations of the United States or of the state of North Dakota of a market value equal at all times to the amount of the deposit, and all banks and trust companies are authorized to give such security for such deposits. The auditor and the auditor’s legally authorized representatives are authorized and empowered from time to time to examine the accounts and books of the authority, including its receipts, disbursements, contracts, leases, sinking funds, investments, and any other records and papers relating to its financial standing. An authority shall have power, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, to contract with the holders of any of its bonds as to the custody, collection, securing, investment, and payment of any moneys of the authority, or any moneys held in trust or otherwise for the payment of bonds or in any way to secure bonds, and to carry out any such contract notwithstanding that such contract may be inconsistent with the previous provisions of this section. Moneys held in trust or otherwise for the payment of bonds or in any way to secure bonds and deposits of such moneys may be acquired in the same manner as moneys of the authority, and all banks and trust companies are authorized to give such security for such deposits.

An authority may from time to time and whenever it deems refunding expedient, refund any bonds by the issuance of new bonds, whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured, and may issue bonds partly to refund bonds then outstanding and partly for any other purpose hereinabove described. The refunding bonds may be exchanged for the bonds to be refunded, with such cash adjustments as may be agreed, or may be sold and the proceeds applied to the purchase or payment of the bonds to be refunded. In computing the total amount of bonds of an authority which may at any time be outstanding, the amount of the outstanding bonds to be refunded from the proceeds of the sale of new bonds or by exchange for new bonds shall be excluded. Except as may otherwise be expressly provided by an authority, the bonds of every issue shall be payable out of any moneys or revenues of an authority, subject only to any agreements with the holders of particular bonds pledging any particular moneys or revenues. Notwithstanding the fact that the bonds may be payable from a special fund, if they are otherwise of such form and character as to be negotiable instruments under chapter 41-08, the bonds shall be and are hereby made negotiable instruments within the meaning of and for all the purposes of chapter 41-08, subject only to the provisions of the bonds for registration.

     <p>
      The resolution determining the necessity of the improvement shall designate the portions of streets to be included within the mall or crossed by skyways and shall state the reason or reasons why such designation is deemed necessary. It is recognized by state policy that such necessity may exist in a city of substantial size for one or more of the following reasons:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-02ol11">
       Increases in population and in automobile usage and parking may create conditions of traffic congestion in the central business district during part or all of normal business hours which may be alleviated by a pedestrian mall or skyways.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-02ol12">
       Continued unlimited use of the designated street or streets may constitute a hazard to the safety of pedestrians and may impede necessary movement of police and fire equipment, ambulances, and other emergency vehicles.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-02ol13">
       Certain streets may be improved to their maximum width for sidewalk and roadway purposes, and may be incapable of further widening without taking buildings and improvements or substantially impeding the movements of pedestrians using the facilities of the central business district.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-02ol14">
       Orderly plans for urban renewal, rehabilitation, and redevelopment may require or may be facilitated by such an improvement.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-02ol15">
       Pedestrian use may be the highest and best use of the designated streets, and the limitation of the use thereof by vehicles may be in the best interest of the city and of the optimum benefit to the properties in the improvement district, if:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-02ol15a">
         Reasonably convenient alternate routes exist for vehicles going through the central business district to other parts of the city and the state;

        <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-02ol15b">
         The designated streets are not federal, state, or county highways, or, if they are, the making of the improvement is conditioned upon the relocation of such highways in the manner provided by law; and
        </li>
        <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-02ol15c">
         Properties abutting on the designated streets can reasonably and adequately receive and deliver merchandise and materials either from other streets or alleys, or by providing for limited use of the designated streets for this purpose.

      The plans and specifications must provide for improvement of the designated streets or construction of skyways in a manner designed for the free movement, safety, convenience, and enjoyment of pedestrians, whether or not part of the mall is made available for emergency or other permitted vehicles. A mall improvement may provide for and include space for seating, cafe tables, shelters, trees, flower plantings, sculptures, newsstands, telephone booths, traffic signs, kiosks, fire hydrants, streetlighting, ornamental lights, trash receptacles, display cases, marquees, awnings, canopies, overhead and underground radiant heating devices, walls, barriers, and all other fixtures, equipment, facilities, and appurtenances as will in the governing body’s judgment enhance the free movement, safety, convenience, and enjoyment of pedestrians and benefit the adjoining properties and the central business district and the city. Sidewalks may be constructed of concrete, bricks, asphalt tiles, blocks, granite sets, or other materials or combinations of materials as the governing body may approve. The governing body may alter any roadway to be kept and maintained in the mall, may cause any street vaults to be reconstructed or removed, may construct crosswalks at any point within or at the ends of blocks, and may cause any roadway to curve and meander within the limits of the street, if determined desirable to enhance the usefulness or appearance of the mall, regardless of any nonuniformity of street width or any curve or absence of curve in the centerline of the street. A skyway may be heated or unheated and may include any fixtures, equipment, facilities, and appurtenances the governing body determines will enhance the free movement, safety, convenience, and enjoyment of pedestrians and benefit the adjoining properties and the central business district and the city.

      </li>
      <li id="t40c40-62s40-62-05ol13">
       The regulations may permit use for any purpose or activity which will enhance the freedom of movement, safety, convenience, or enjoyment of pedestrians, including but not limited to, seating, sidewalk cafes, displays of merchandise, exhibits, advertising, telephones, transit, transit stops and shelters, newsstands, plantings, ornaments, protection from the elements, emergency vehicles, and police and fire equipment.

     <p>
      A pedestrian mall or skyway established pursuant to this chapter may be maintained and the cost of such maintenance may be paid by all means permitted by law for streets. The governing body may also annually cause an estimate to be made of the probable cost of the maintenance during the current fiscal year, in excess of the cost of maintenance of streets of similar length, width, and location not used as a mall, and may assess the excess cost of maintenance on properties within the improvement district; provided, that the assessments may not exceed the special benefits determined to be received by the properties from the maintenance. The assessment list approved by the governing body must be filed in the office of the city auditor, who must mail to the street address of each lot and parcel proposed to be assessed, and to any other address as may be requested in writing by the owner or occupant of a lot or parcel, a notice stating the amount proposed to be assessed upon the lot or parcel, and that any objection thereto may be made in writing filed with the city auditor on or before a specified date, not less than twenty days after the mailing, on which date, at a time and place specified in the notice, the governing body will consider all objections. At this meeting, or any adjournment thereof, the governing body shall review all assessments and hear all persons desiring to be heard, and may amend the assessments in such manner as it determines to be just and reasonable, and may confirm the same and direct the assessment list to be filed with the county auditor, and the assessments made therein to be extended upon the tax lists of the city for the current year and collected with interest and penalties as general taxes are collected and paid over to the city auditor and placed by the auditor in a special fund to be used only for the purpose of current, reasonable and necessary expenses of the operation and maintenance of the mall or skyway.

The election must be made on the taxpayer’s return as originally and timely filed.

       Each city with a designated renaissance zone may establish a renaissance fund organization, if the detailed plan for such an organization is clearly established in the development plan and approved with the plan, or is submitted at a later date to the department of commerce division of community services for approval after the designation of a renaissance zone.
      </li>

       The purpose of a renaissance fund organization is solely to raise funds to be used to finance zone projects and other projects located in designated renaissance zones. A renaissance fund organization may provide financing to projects undertaken by individuals, partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts, corporations, nonprofit organizations, and public entities. The financing may include any combination of equity investments, loans, guarantees, and commitments for financing. The amount of financing is not limited by this chapter.

       A renaissance fund organization is exempt from any tax imposed by chapter 57-38. An exemption under this section may be passed through to any shareholder, partner, and owner if the renaissance fund organization is a passthrough entity for tax purposes. A corporation entitled to the exemption provided by this subsection shall file required returns and report income to the tax commissioner as required by the provisions of chapter 57-38 as if the exemption did not exist. If an employer, this subsection does not exempt a renaissance fund organization from complying with the income tax withholding laws.

The amount of the credit is fifty percent of the amount invested in the renaissance fund organization during the taxable year. Any amount of credit which exceeds a taxpayer’s tax liability for the taxable year may be carried forward for up to five taxable years after the taxable year in which the investment was made.

       The total amount of credits allowed under this section may not exceed, in the aggregate, ten million five hundred thousand dollars for investments in renaissance fund organizations.

       Income to a renaissance fund organization derived from the sale or refinancing of zone properties financed wholly or in part by the organization may be disbursed as annual dividends equal to the income, minus ten percent, derived from all sources and proportional to the investment. In the event of a loss to the fund resulting in a temporary diminishment of the fund below the original principal amount, no annual dividend may be paid until the fund is restored.

A renaissance fund organization shall file a copy of each audit of its financial records under this subsection with the governing body of the city in which it was established, the department of commerce division of community services, and the tax commissioner. The department of commerce division of community services shall provide an annual report to the budget section of the legislative management showing the conclusions of audit reports filed under this subsection.
