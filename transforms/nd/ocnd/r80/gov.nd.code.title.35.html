        A real estate mortgage executed to the state to secure a loan from the permanent school fund conveys no title to the land, constitutes a mere pledge of the land as security for the debt, and does not differ in nature from the ordinary real estate mortgage. State v. Divide County, 68 N.D. 708, 283 N.W. 184, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1938).

         Similarity Between Lien and Garnishment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Practically speaking, a garnishment’s purpose is very similar to that of a lien. The garnishment summons requires a garnishee to withhold property for the benefit of a judgment creditor in order that a judgment creditor be satisfied. Generally, garnished property is to be released if the judgment creditor is satisfied with other property or by agreement of the parties. Likewise, a lender’s reason for obtaining a lien on property is to gain assurance of debt repayment. A lien on property is generally released upon repayment of the obligation on loan. If the obligation is not repaid, the lender may have the right to have the property turned over for debt satisfaction. In re Da-Sota Elevator Co., 135 B.R. 873, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 1976 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1991).

     <p>
      A lien or security interest is created by contract or by operation of law. No lien arises by operation of law until the time at which the act secured by the lien is to be performed. A security interest in personal property is governed by chapter 41-09, except that a bill of sale or security agreement, that is not a purchase money security interest, with respect to household goods, effects, furniture of married persons, or personal property exempt from execution is void unless the instrument by which it is transferred or encumbered is jointly executed by the husband and wife, if both are living. This section does not apply to transfers or liens arising by operation of law nor to security agreements relating to threshed grains made with any lending agency authorized to make commodity credit corporation loans on threshed grains.

        A mortgage upon a tenant’s interest in a crop attaches on the division thereof. Bidgood v. Monarch Elevator Co., 9 N.D. 627, 84 N.W. 561, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Even though one vehicle was titled in corporate name and the other in the name of a person, it is reasonable to presume, because the vehicles were listed as being owned by the business, that the two trucks and the van were used in the business. Therefore, they are included in the category of “equipment” covered by the security agreement. Since the bank was listed as lienholder on the title documents for those vehicles, the bank’s security interest was properly perfected.

       District court erred when it held that an oil pipeline lien wasn’t extinguished until a lien foreclosure was ruled on by the court because, if the obligation the lien secured was satisfied, then the lien was extinguished and no longer valid.

      When a person has a lien upon several things and other persons have subordinate liens upon or interests in some but not all of the same things, the person having the prior lien, if that person can do so without the risk of loss to that person or of injustice to other persons, on the demand of any party interested, must resort to the property in the following order:

      The sale of any property in satisfaction of a lien, or in case of personal property, the wrongful conversion thereof by the person holding the lien, extinguishes the lien thereon. In an action for the conversion of personal property, the defendant may show in mitigation of damages the amount due on any lien to which the plaintiff’s rights were subject and which was held or paid by the defendant or any person under whom the defendant claims.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a party seeks to recover a statutory penalty, statute must be specifically complied with. Greenberg v. Union Nat'l Bank, 5 N.D. 483, 67 N.W. 597, 1896 <cite class="nd_code"><cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 4</cite>7</cite> (N.D. 1896); Peckham v. Van Bergen, 10 N.D. 43, 84 N.W. 566, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 4</cite> (N.D. 1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complaint must clearly indicate statute under which penalty is claimed, and that release which lien holder was requested to execute could have been executed by him without expense. Sheets v. Prosser, 16 N.D. 180, 112 N.W. 72, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 1907).

       </h5>
       <p>
        If amount due on a mortgage is tendered and deposited in a bank, as provided by law, it is a payment and satisfaction and renders the mortgagee liable for the penalty. Kronebusch v. Raumin, 42 N.W. 656, 6 Dakota 243, 1889 Dakota LEXIS 15 (Dakota 1889); Swallow v. First State Bank, 35 N.D. 608, 161 N.W. 207, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1917).

      The costs and fees for the foreclosure of a statutory lien on personal property are the same as are provided in the foreclosure of a security interest in personal property. The person making the sale shall make a written report of all proceedings in such foreclosure, specifying the property sold, the amount received therefor, the amount of the costs and expenses itemized, and the disposition of the proceeds of the sale. The person shall verify the report under oath and file the same within ten days after the sale in the office of the recorder of the county or counties where the lien is filed.

        A mortgage can be extended only by an instrument in writing formally executed, but such provision has no reference to an extension of time for payment of debt secured, mortgage being extended within meaning of statute when it is made to stand for a debt or obligation not originally included therein.

       A mortgage is a contract by which specific real property capable of being transferred is hypothecated for the performance of an act without requiring a change in possession, and includes a transfer of an interest in real property, other than a trust, made only to secure the performance of an act.

       <p>
        When a mortgagor
   purports to grant a mortgage on property the mortgagor does not then
   own and thereafter acquires title to that property, the title inures
   to the mortgagee as security for the debt. Therefore, because the
   plain language of a 1988 mortgage covered only mineral interests owned
   of record when the mortgage was executed and did not purport to cover
   the separate mineral interests the owners’ obtained in 1990,
   title to the dispute mineral interest was properly quieted in the
   owners. Rasnic v. ConocoPhillips Co., 2014 ND 181, 854 N.W.2d 659, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        To prove a deed absolute on its face a mortgage, the evidence must be clear, convincing, and satisfactory. Jasper v. Hazen, 4 N.D. 1, 58 N.W. 454, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        One who unconditionally transfers property thereafter is estopped from claiming that it was a mortgage if transfer was relied upon by grantee as an absolute conveyance. McGuin v. Lee, 10 N.D. 160, 86 N.W. 714, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 24</cite> (N.D. 1901).

       <p>
        In an action by a vendor to have an absolute deed adjudged a mortgage, it is unnecessary to prove a tender in any form, it being sufficient to prove a willingness to redeem by paying the amount adjudged to be due and owing.

        Whether an instrument was intended by parties to be an absolute deed or a mortgage may be shown by parol evidence. Miller v. Smith, 20 N.D. 96, 126 N.W. 499, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed absolute on its face may be shown to be a mortgage in fact securing a debt existing at time of its execution. Adams v. McIntyre, 22 N.D. 337, 133 N.W. 915, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 1911).

        One of strongest and surest tests as to whether a conveyance, absolute in form, is a security conveyance is continuance of indebtedness. Dean v. Smith, 53 N.D. 123, 204 N.W. 987, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mortgage is an incident of debt, and without a debt, obligation, or liability there is nothing to secure and consequently there can be no mortgage. Dean v. Smith, 53 N.D. 123, 204 N.W. 987, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1924).

        In order to have a mortgage it is essential that there be an agreement, express or implied, on part of mortgagor or other person in whose behalf the mortgage is executed, to pay a debt or discharge in some other form an obligation which is owing to mortgagee.

       <p>
        The reservation of a right to repurchase, or an agreement to reconvey, without a debt or obligation to be performed by grantor is not sufficient to stamp an absolute conveyance as a mortgage.

        Deed which is absolute on its face may be held to be a mortgage when such was the intention of the parties and when that intention was established by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence.

        Judgments do not attach as liens upon after-acquired real property in the order of time of their docketing. Zink v. James River Nat'l Bank, 58 N.D. 1, 224 N.W. 901, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 1929).

        The fact that mortgagor, after foreclosure and prior to acquiring title to mortgaged property, went through bankruptcy does not affect an estoppel by mortgage covenants. Merchants' Nat'l Bank v. Miller, 59 N.D. 273, 229 N.W. 357, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 1930); Aure v. Mackoff, 93 N.W.2d 807, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        A debtor giving a second mortgage, covenanting against encumbrances, and warranting title, is estopped to deny validity of second mortgage after repurchasing land after foreclosure of first mortgage.

        Provision similar to subsection 4 of this statute was not limited to title acquired after execution of the mortgage and before its foreclosure, but applied after the foreclosure of the mortgage.

        When a mortgagor
   purports to grant a mortgage on property the mortgagor does not then
   own and thereafter acquires title to that property, the title inures
   to the mortgagee as security for the debt. Therefore, because the
   plain language of a 1988 mortgage covered only mineral interests owned
   of record when the mortgage was executed and did not purport to cover
   the separate mineral interests the owners’ obtained in 1990, title
   to the dispute mineral interest was properly quieted in the owners. Rasnic v. ConocoPhillips Co., 2014 ND 181, 854 N.W.2d 659, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2014).

    Recording and filing assignment of mortgage — Notice to whom.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An assignment of a mortgage may be recorded or filed in the same manner as a mortgage, and the record thereof operates as notice to all persons subsequently deriving title to the mortgage from the assignor. When the mortgage is executed as security for money due or to become due on a promissory note, bond, or other instrument designated in the mortgage, the record of the assignment of the mortgage is not of itself notice to a mortgagor or a mortgagor’s heirs or personal representatives so as to invalidate any payment made by them or either of them to the person holding such note, bond, or other instrument.

        District court properly granted summary judgment quieting title in a tract of land to a buyer, directing the trust to convey the land to him, and dismissing the trust's counterclaims because, assuming there was fraud by the buyer, the counterclaims were untimely, the trust's acceptance of sporadic payments for more than 30 years waived the clause in the contract for deed making time of the essence, and, although the buyer might have continued to make sporadic payments to the trust and to record additional mortgages and satisfactions on the property, the trust was deemed to have constructive notice of the record in the recorder's office.

    Collateral real estate mortgages.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A mortgage which contains the following statement in printed or typed capital letters: “THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THIS MORTGAGE CONSTITUTES A COLLATERAL REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE PURSUANT TO NORTH DAKOTA CENTURY CODE CHAPTER 35-03” is subject to the provisions of this section. A mortgage executed pursuant to this section must be entitled in printed or typed capital letters: “MORTGAGE — COLLATERAL REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE”. A mortgage made pursuant to this section, notwithstanding the fact that from time to time during the term thereof no indebtedness is due from the mortgagor to the mortgagee, constitutes a continuing lien against the real property covered thereby for the amount stated in the mortgage. Any sums not exceeding the face amount of the mortgage, together with interest thereon as provided in the instrument secured by the mortgage, advanced by the mortgagee during the term of the mortgage have a lien priority as of the date the mortgage was filed. At any time the indebtedness due the mortgagee is zero, the mortgagor may demand in writing that the mortgage be satisfied, and the mortgagee shall within ten days thereafter execute and record a satisfaction thereof. Collateral real estate mortgages may be used to secure commercial, agricultural, or consumer loans or lines of credit including, but not limited to, revolving notes and credits and overdraft checking plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      A filed collateral real estate mortgage which states a maturity date of the instrument secured thereby of five years or less is effective until such maturity date and thereafter for a period of sixty days. Any other filed collateral real estate mortgage is effective for a period of five years from the date of filing and thereafter for a period of sixty days. A filed collateral real estate mortgage which states that the instrument secured thereby is payable on demand is effective for five years from the date of filing and thereafter for a period of sixty days. The effectiveness of a filed collateral real estate mortgage lapses upon the expiration of the sixty-day period unless an addendum to the collateral real estate mortgage extending its effective date is filed prior to the lapse. If a filed collateral real estate mortgage exists at the time insolvency proceedings are commenced by or against the debtor, the mortgage remains effective until sixty days after termination of the insolvency proceeding or until expiration of the five-year period, whichever occurs later. Upon such lapse, the lien created by the collateral real estate mortgage terminates. An addendum continuing the effectiveness of the lien of the collateral real estate mortgage may be filed by the mortgagee:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t35c35-03s35-03-17ol11">
       Within six months before and sixty days after a stated maturity date of five years or less; and
      </li>
      <li id="t35c35-03s35-03-17ol12">
       Otherwise within six months before and sixty days after the expiration of the five-year effective date period.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      An addendum to a collateral real estate mortgage for the sole purpose of continuing the effectiveness of its lien need be signed only by the mortgagee. Upon the timely filing of such an addendum to a collateral real estate mortgage, the effectiveness of the collateral real estate mortgage will be continued for five years after the stated maturity date in those instances in which the original collateral real estate mortgage provided a maturity date or for five years after the expiration of the five-year period whereupon it lapses in the same manner as provided above unless another addendum to the collateral real estate mortgage continuing the effectiveness of its lien is filed prior to such lapse. Succeeding addendums to collateral real estate mortgages may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the lien of the collateral real estate mortgage.

         Anti-Deficiency Judgment Statutes.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Neither the express terms of this section, nor the legislative history of the statute, suggests that the anti-deficiency judgment statutes were intended to be inapplicable to collateral real estate mortgages. Gust v. Peoples &amp; Enderlin State Bank, 447 N.W.2d 914, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       <p>
        Bank’s argument that the anti-deficiency judgment statutes were inapplicable and that it was free to pursue its action on promissory note because its collateral real estate mortgage had lapsed under the terms of this section was without merit. Gust v. Peoples &amp; Enderlin State Bank, 447 N.W.2d 914, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       <p>
        When a collateral real estate mortgage has inadvertently lapsed pursuant to this section, the lender is not completely barred from any remedy. To prevent unjust enrichment of the borrower and to provide restitution to the lender, an equitable remedy should be implied. Where the property is still available for application to the debt, the lender may proceed to enforce the particular remedy of an equitable lien against the property which was mortgaged as security.

      Unless otherwise stated in the loan or mortgage, within seven business days after receipt of a written request that specifies the name of the owner of the property and the loan number assigned to a loan secured by a mortgage on residential real property and that indicates the information is necessary to close a sale of the property, the servicer of a loan secured by a mortgage on residential real property shall provide to the owner of the property or to that person’s representative full information concerning the amount necessary on a date specified in the request to pay off the loan and of any amount held in escrow for payment of insurance premiums, taxes, and other costs relating to the real property. The servicer of the loan secured by a mortgage may not charge any fee for providing the information.
     </p>

      If the servicer of the loan fails to deposit with the United States postal service, facsimile, or deliver personally the information requested within seven business days after receipt of the written request for information and the closing date for sale of the property is postponed as a result of the delay, the servicer of the loan is liable to the owner of the property for all damages sustained because of the delay. Notwithstanding any other law, an action brought to recover damages under this section must be heard in the county where the real property is located or where the plaintiff resides if the residence is within this state.

The delegation to an agent by a title insurance company does not relieve the title insurance company of any liability for damages caused by its agent for the wrongful or erroneous execution of a certificate of release. The appointment of agent must be executed and acknowledged as required by law in the case of a deed and must state the title insurance company as the grantor, the identity of the person authorized to act as agent to execute and record certificates of release provided for in this section on behalf of the title insurance company, that the agent has the full authority to execute and record certificates of release provided for in this section on behalf of the title insurance company, the term of appointment of the agent, and that the agent has consented to and accepts the terms of the appointment. A single appointment of agent may be recorded in each county in each recorder’s office. A separate appointment of agent may not be necessary for each certificate of release. The appointment of agent may be rerecorded when necessary to establish authority of the agent. The authority continues until a revocation of appointment is recorded with the recorder where the appointment of agent was recorded.

       For purposes of releasing the mortgage, a certificate of release containing the information and statements provided for in this section and executed as provided in this section is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in the certificate, is entitled to be recorded with the recorder, and operates as a release of the mortgage described in the certificate. The recorder shall rely upon the certificate to release the mortgage. Recording of a wrongful or erroneous certificate of release by a title insurance company or its agent does not relieve the mortgagor, or the mortgagor’s successors or assigns, from any personal liability on the loan or other obligations secured by the mortgage. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, a title insurance company wrongfully or erroneously recording a certificate of release under this section is liable to the mortgagee for actual damage sustained due to the recording of the certificate of release.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A security interest upon crops attaches only to the crop next maturing after the delivery of the security agreement. The financing statement covering a crop cannot be used to enforce a security interest on any crop other than the crop listed in the security agreement. If the court finds a willful violation of this section, the court shall award a producer the reasonable expenses of maintaining an action, including reasonable attorney’s fees. The provisions of this section do not apply to liens by contract given to secure the purchase price or the rental of land upon which the crops covered by the lien are to be grown or to a security interest upon crops created by a security agreement that contains an after-acquired property clause and the following wording or its equivalent, in boldface print or set forth in some other conspicuous manner, is in the agreement: “This security agreement covers crops now growing. This security agreement also covers future crops to be grown in the current year or any year hereafter.”. The lien on future crops maintains its priority as to crops grown in future years only so long as the lienholder continues to provide operating funds to the borrower. If, in any subsequent year, another entity entitled to a crop security interest under section 35-05-01 advances operating funds to a borrower, the entity has a first priority purchase money security interest in the crops grown by the borrower during the year in which the funds are advanced.

    Fraudulent misrepresentation of property pledged — Rights of creditor.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a debtor has obtained credit or an extension of time by a fraudulent misrepresentation of the value of the property pledged by or for the debtor, the creditor may demand a further pledge to correspond with the value represented and in default thereof may recover the creditor’s debt immediately though it is not actually due.

If the contractor or subcontractor does not give the owner or the owner’s agent written notice within ten days after the receipt of the papers that the contractor or subcontractor intends to dispute the claim, or if ten days after giving the notice the contractor or subcontractor refuses or neglects to have the matter adjusted, the contractor or subcontractor shall be considered to have assented thereto, and such owner or the owner’s agent may pay the amount when it becomes due, and for that purpose may deduct the amount out of any moneys due the contractor who in like manner may deduct the amount from any moneys due from the contractor to the contractor’s subcontractor in case the account or demand is against a subcontractor for work and labor performed or materials furnished.

        No plain error would compel application of this statute where the terms of an oral contract between the parties establishing grazing rights for cattle, which allowed cattle owners to remove their cattle from property owners’ land at any time, made the statute peripheral.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In an oral contract establishing grazing rights, whether possession of cattle was entrusted to the landowners within the meaning of the statute was a factual one, not a matter of law, and was a question for the trier of fact to determine from the evidence presented at trial, not for an appellate court to decide from a cold record. Taghon v. Kuhn, 497 N.W.2d 403, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        The lien of a stable keeper is not lost, even as to an attaching creditor, because the horse is temporarily in possession of the owner if the owner plans to return it to the stable and the arrangement under which the horse is being boarded is still in existence.

     <p>
      An agister’s lien has priority over all other liens on the property for ten days after the receipt thereof, and thereafter has priority over all other liens on the property if the person to whom the property is entrusted as provided in this chapter, within such ten days, serves written notice upon the holders of prior liens that the property has been entrusted for one or more of the purposes mentioned in section 35-17-01, specifies which purpose, and the name of the person entrusting the property therefor. If the residence of the holder of the lien is unknown, or if the holder is not a resident of this state, the notice may be served by publication thereof in one issue of a newspaper published in the county in which the property is being kept.

     <p>
      In addition to sections 35-17-01 and 35-17-02, any person to whom any animal is entrusted by the owner for the purpose of feeding, herding, pasturing, or ranching, upon filing the statement prescribed in section 35-17-04, is entitled to a lien upon the animal for the amount that may be due for feeding, herding, pasturing, or ranching, effective from the date the person entitled to the lien comes into possession of the animal. A lien taken pursuant to this section upon anything other than the animal is void. An agister’s lien has priority, as to the animals covered by the lien, over all other liens or encumbrances, except agricultural processors’ or agricultural suppliers’ liens.

     <p>
      Any charitable association, corporation, or other institution maintaining a hospital in this state is entitled to a lien for the reasonable value of hospitalization services rendered to a person injured in any accident. The lien attaches to all claims for relief, claims, demands, and judgments recovered on account of the injuries against persons or corporations liable to the injured person in tort for damages occasioned by negligence causing the injuries, and attaches to the proceeds of the settlement of such claims or demands, and to insurance of the tort-feasor payable by reason of the liability occasioned by such injury, and to any insurance or indemnity payable to the injured person by any insurer.

        Hospital lien attached to all claims for relief and resulting settlement proceeds and was perfected and enforceable against the same by virtue of the fact that all parties had actual notice of the lien. The lien, as a consequence, remained valid and enforceable against an annuity which constituted the proceeds of a settlement under this section. In re Smith, 119 B.R. 714, 1990 Bankr.

       <p>
        The lien afforded by this section attaches not only to all claims arising in tort but also attaches to “any insurance or indemnity payable to the injured person by any insurer.” The foregoing quoted language is inclusive of any insurance from any source including a no-fault insurer’s payment. Medcenter One, Inc. v. Dueis, 130 B.R. 83 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section creates a lien on the insurance proceeds that are “payable” for the injury sustained; the fact that the injured person did not actually receive the payments does not mean that the hospital’s lien does not attach to the insurance policy proceeds. Nodak Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stegman, 2002 ND 113, 647 N.W.2d 133, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 2002).

       <p>
        Section 506(d) of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Code is inapplicable to a lien under this section because a hospital’s lien is secured by value. In re Smith, 119 B.R. 714, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2117 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lien created under this section is not avoidable under 11 USCS § 522(f) because it is neither a judicial lien nor a nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interest. In re Smith, 119 B.R. 714, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2117 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lien created under this section was not subject to avoidance under 11 USCS § 545 because it first became effective against the debtor long before bankruptcy petition was filed and was, as of the date of the petition, perfected in a manner consistent with applicable North Dakota law. In re Smith, 119 B.R. 714, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2117 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although a hospital lien, as with any statutory lien, is purely a creature of statute, the clear weight of authority in this and other jurisdictions is that the statutory requirement must be fairly complied with. That is, substantial, rather than strict, compliance satisfies the legislative intent. Medcenter One, Inc. v. Dueis, 130 B.R. 83 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where hospital lien statement, in failing to set out the discharge date on its face, did not strictly comply with the statute, such information was readily ascertainable from the attached billing statements and thus the requirement was substantially and fairly complied with. The lien is not invalid on basis of noncompliance with this section. Medcenter One, Inc. v. Dueis, 130 B.R. 83 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1991).

       <p>
        Hospital furnishing care and treatment acquires a lien upon rendering such service. Mere furnishing of services creates the lien, and it is either by actual or constructive notice that the lien is perfected. In re Smith, 119 B.R. 714, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2117 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).

       <p>
        This section, requiring filing of a lien statement not later than 30 days after rendering services, as well as N.D.C.C. § 35-18-02, requiring service of notice of intent to file, are not, in the case of hospital liens, statutory prerequisites for attachment, but both are merely constructive notice provisions which must be met to accomplish perfection only if the party entitled to notice does not have actual notice of the lien. In re Smith, 119 B.R. 714, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 2117 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).

      The filing of a hospital statement, from the time of filing thereof, is constructive notice to all persons of the claim of the hospital and of its right to a lien upon any claim or demand or claim for relief against the tort-feasors and the insurer or insurers of the tort-feasors, or an insurer of the injured person, and no release of any judgment, claim, or demand by the injured person is valid or effective as against the lien. The person, corporation, or limited liability company making any payment to the injured person, or to the injured person’s legal representative, as compensation for injuries sustained, in settlement of a claim for relief claimed to exist for negligence causing such injuries, or out of insurance carried by the tort-feasor, shall remain liable to the hospital for the amount of the reasonable charges due at the time of such payment to the extent of the full amount so paid or given to the injured person.

      Any hospital or institution securing a lien under this chapter may enforce its lien in a civil action against the tort-feasor, the insurer of the tort-feasor, or the insurer of the injured person. A judgment obtained against the tort-feasor or any insurer does not bar the hospital or institution from collecting the amount of its account from the person for whom the services were rendered, or that person’s insurer, unless payment has been made by the tort-feasor or tort-feasor’s insurer to the hospital, and then only to the extent that payment has been made.

      Upon the trial of any action for damages for personal injuries wherein it appears at the trial that services were rendered in hospitalization of the injured person, the court before whom the action is tried shall require the clerk of the district court to search the records for information as to whether a lien has been filed, and if a lien has been filed, mention of that fact and a statement of the amount claimed must be made in the judgment. If the parties to the action admit the facts set forth in any lien described in the judgment, and the judgment is collected under execution, an amount equal to the amount claimed in the lien must be deposited with the clerk of the district court for the payment of the lien when the execution is returned. If the lien is contested, the deposit must be held to abide the final event of an action to enforce the lien, which action must be brought by the hospital or the institution within sixty days after a demand therefor is made by any of the parties interested.

      When a buyer of real property gives to the seller a written contract for payment of all or part of the price, an absolute transfer of the contract by the seller waives the seller’s lien to the extent of the sum payable under the contract, but a transfer of the contract in trust to pay debts and return the surplus is not a waiver of the lien.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any interested person may release an attorney’s lien by executing an undertaking in an amount double the amount claimed, or in such other amount as may be fixed by a judge of the district court of the county in which the lien is filed or in which the subject of the lien is held. The undertaking must be conditioned to pay to the attorney the amount finally due the attorney for the attorney’s services, which amount may be ascertained by suit on the undertaking. The undertaking must be filed after approval by the clerk of court of the county. Any interested person may make written demand upon the holder of an attorney’s lien for a bill of particulars of the services and amount claimed for each item or upon each written contract with the person for whom the services were rendered, and thereupon, unless such bill of particulars is furnished within ten days after service of the demand, the lien must be released.

    Lien for repair, protection, improvement, safekeeping, or carriage of personalty.

     <p>
      Every person, excepting those entitled to a specific lien under other chapters of this title, who, while lawfully in possession of an article of personal property, renders any service to the owner thereof by labor or skill employed for the repair, protection, improvement, safekeeping, or carriage thereof has a special lien thereon, dependent on possession, for the compensation, if any, which is due to the person from the owner for such service. In addition to other remedies available for the enforcement of liens, the holder of such special lien may foreclose the same and acquire ownership of such article of personal property, provided the holder of such a special lien has obtained the address of the owner at the time such article was left, by causing a notice of intention to foreclose such special lien to be sent to the owner thereof, by registered or certified mail, to the address obtained from such owner at the time such article is left, which notice shall be in substantially the following form:
     </p>
     <p>
      To , owner of (describe the article upon which lien is claimed.) You are hereby notified that the undersigned claims a special lien upon the above-described article by virtue of section 35-20-11, and hereby further advises you of the undersigned’s intention to foreclose such special lien and acquire ownership of such article, unless the sum of (insert amount claimed) is paid within sixty days from the date hereof; or unless you shall notify the undersigned within such period of your election to challenge the amount claimed due for services rendered thereon. Dated (Party claiming lien)
     </p>
     <p>
      Click to view
     </p>
     <p>
      If, at the expiration of sixty days from the date of mailing such notice, payment has not been received of the amount claimed to be due, or an election to challenge the amount due has been received, the lien claimant is deemed to have succeeded to ownership of the article of personal property upon which the special possessory lien is claimed.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the owner of such property causes an election to challenge the amount claimed to be delivered to the lienholder, then the summary foreclosure procedure set out herein is not available to the lien claimant; and the lien must be foreclosed by action.

       A landlord of a mobile home lot has a lien for accrued rents, storage, and removal relating to any mobile home left on the lot after the tenant has vacated the premises after an eviction or the expiration of the lease term. A lien under this section does not have priority over a prior perfected security interest in the property. A holder of a lien under this section may retain possession of the mobile home subject to the lien until the amount due is paid.

       For the lien or subsequent title obtained by the lienholder to be valid against a good-faith purchaser, the landlord shall post a signed and dated notice of the lien on the primary entrance to the mobile home. An individual who without authorization from the landlord willfully removes the notice is guilty of a class B misdemeanor. The notice of lien must contain the name and last-known address of the owner of the mobile home, the name and post-office address of the lien claimant, the amount of the lien, a description of the location and type of mobile home, and a recitation of the penalty provisions of this section.

If the location of the former mobile home owner is not known, any money from a sale in excess of the amount owed is presumed abandoned under chapter 47-30.2.

        An undertaking given in pursuance of this section to release a seed lien on grain takes the place of the grain and retains for lien holder the same security he had under the lien against the grain. Narveson v. Schmid, 77 N.D. 814, 46 N.W.2d 288, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subcontractors could recover from the funds deposited into court by the owner of a building because the subcontractors were not required to sue the general contractor before enforcing their claim against the owner as the funds deposited by the owner to release the subcontractors’ liens became a substitute for the security of the liens. However, the subcontractors were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the owner raised a genuine issue of material fact as to the amounts paid to the subcontractors by the general contractor. SWMO LLC v. Eagle Rigid Spans Inc., 2019 ND 207, 932 N.W.2d 120, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Before a lien claimant can recover from sureties on an undertaking to release a seed lien under this section, he must prove his seed lien and amount due thereunder. Narveson v. Schmid, 77 N.D. 814, 46 N.W.2d 288, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1951).

        The sureties on an undertaking to release a seed lien under his section take upon themselves obligation of paying whatever lien holder could recover on foreclosure of lien. Narveson v. Schmid, 77 N.D. 814, 46 N.W.2d 288, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1951).

      If the clerk of court receives an exception to the sufficiency of the sureties within seven days of the date of service, the clerk shall schedule a hearing before the district court judge at which the sureties may be justified. The clerk shall provide notice of the hearing to both the lien claimant and the applicant for the discharge by undertaking. <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-02" target="_blank">Chapter 32-02</a></cite> governs the justification of the sureties. If the clerk of court does not receive an exception to the sufficiency of the sureties, within seven days from the date of service, the clerk of court shall issue an order stating that the lien is discharged by undertaking and directing either the recorder or the secretary of state, as appropriate, to file the order of discharge to terminate the lien and to remove the lien from any computerized index system on which it appears or, in the case of a lien that is filed manually, to indicate in the margin of the record “discharged by undertaking”. If the sureties justify as provided in this section, and if the undertaking is approved, the judge shall enter an order that the lien is discharged by undertaking and direct the recorder or the secretary of state, as appropriate, to file the order of discharge and terminate the lien on any computerized index system on which it appears or, in the case of a lien that is filed manually, to indicate in the margin of the record “discharged by undertaking”. After the order, the lien is of no effect.

        A power of sale inserted in a real estate mortgage is a power coupled with an interest, and is not revoked by death of mortgagor; thus foreclosure is effective as to mortgagor’s heirs. Grandin v. Emmons, 10 N.D. 223, 86 N.W. 723, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1901).

        Where a mortgage misdescribed the mortgaged property, a foreclosure by advertisement ordinarily was not effective as against subsequent mortgagees, although they had knowledge of the execution of mortgage and misdescription therein; where misdescription made it impossible to identify realty without extraneous evidence, subsequent mortgagee was permitted to redeem after expiration of statutory redemption period.

      Before any real estate mortgage may be foreclosed by advertisement, a notice of intention to foreclose such mortgage must be served on the record title owner of the real estate described in the mortgage unless the service thereof is excused by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-19s32-19-23" target="_blank">32-19-23.</a></cite> Such notice must be in the form specified in section 32-19-21, and must be served as provided for the service of such notice in foreclosure by action as prescribed in chapter 32-19, and the proof of service thereof, or the proof of death of the record title owner, must be recorded with the notice and certificate of sale. If the owner of the land or the owner’s legal representative, before the expiration of thirty days from the service of the notice of intention to foreclose the mortgage, performs or complies with the conditions of the mortgage, the mortgage remains in full force and effect the same as if no default had occurred. If the notice of sale is not published for the first time within ninety days after the service of the notice of intention to foreclose, all proceedings under the notice of intention to foreclose are deemed discontinued.

        The right to designate tracts in a foreclosure sale was not an unknown right which could not have been waived under the real estate mortgage prior to the 1987 enactment of this section (note).

        Despite statutory provisions providing for the sale of real property as known lots or parcels, mortgagors may at the time of executing the mortgage waive the statutory right to have real property sold in separate lots or parcels.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the mortgagee or the mortgagee’s assignee has served notice of intention to foreclose a mortgage, and within the period provided by such notice it is made to appear by the affidavit of the mortgagor, or any person claiming under the mortgagor, or the mortgagor’s agent or attorney, to the satisfaction of a judge of the district court of the county where the mortgaged property is situated, that the mortgagor has a legal counterclaim or any other valid defense against the collection of the whole or any part of the amount claimed to be due on such mortgage, which proof must be made by affidavit stating the facts, but not on information and belief, such judge, by an order to that effect, may enjoin the mortgagee or the mortgagee’s assignee from foreclosing the mortgage by advertisement and may direct that all further proceedings for the foreclosure thereof be had in the district court having jurisdiction of the subject matter. After the expiration of the period provided by the notice of intention, an order enjoining the foreclosure by advertisement shall be made only on motion or order to show cause. Notice of such motion, together with the affidavit used in support thereof, must be served upon the attorney or agent of the mortgagee or assignee in the same manner as service of other notices of motion, not less than eight days before the hearing thereon. The affidavit in support of the motion must state the facts upon which the application is made, may not be on information and belief, and must disclose a legal counterclaim or other valid defense to the collection of the whole or some part of the amount claimed to be due on the mortgage. Upon the hearing of the motion, the judge may enjoin the foreclosure of the mortgage by advertisement in the same manner as if the application had been made ex parte within the period of the notice of intention to foreclose. Service of the restraining order may be made upon the attorney or agent of the mortgagee or assignee, if the order was obtained ex parte, or if obtained on motion or order to show cause, it may be served upon the attorney or agent or upon the sheriff of the county where the foreclosure sale is to be had. If the notice of intention does not disclose the address of a resident agent or attorney, the order may be served upon such sheriff.

        In amending this section in 1931, the legislature distinguished, the requirements for obtaining an injunction within the period provided by the notice of intention to foreclose in accordance with N.D.C.C. §
   35-22-03 and the requirements for obtaining an injunction after the period has expired. If the mortgagor’s affidavit is filed within thirty days of the notice of intention to foreclose, the granting of an injunction is virtually automatic in an ex parte proceeding upon the presentation of a legal counterclaim or any other valid defense to the mortgage foreclosure. After the expiration of the thirty-day period, an injunction is issued only upon motion or order to show cause. The legislature has specifically directed that a hearing shall be held in this instance. Heidt v. State, 372 N.W.2d 857, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 366</cite> (N.D. 1985).

The deed has the same force and effect as if it had been executed pursuant to a sale under a foreclosure of the mortgage by an action in which all persons having an interest in or lien upon the property subsequent to the mortgage were made parties and duly served with process.

       <p>
        An officer selling at foreclosure sale by advertisement cannot excuse himself for nonpayment of surplus to mortgagor by showing that it went into hands of mortgagee. First Methodist Episcopal Church v. Fadden, 8 N.D. 162, 77 N.W. 615, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1898).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under C.L. 1887, § 5424, the junior mortgagee was entitled to surplus proceeds of the sale after satisfying the mortgage foreclosed on by advertisement; word “assigns” was sufficiently broad to include junior mortgagee. Nichols v. Tingstad, 10 N.D. 172, 86 N.W. 694, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 1901).

       </h5>
       <p>
        If a mortgage is executed by two parties, and if a surplus remains in sheriff’s hands after foreclosure sale by advertisement, he is required to pay same to mortgagors on demand and one mortgagor cannot maintain an action for such surplus without alleging that entire right thereto was transferred to him.

      A person filing the petition as prescribed in section 35-22-23, after the expiration of thirty days from the day of sale, may apply to the district court for an order thereon. Notice of the application must be served either by mail or personally upon each person who has filed a like petition, upon the mortgagor, the person in actual possession of the property, if any, and upon every person having an interest in or lien upon the property sold subsequent to the mortgage foreclosed and whose interest or lien, at the time of the sale, was recorded in the proper office in the county or counties in which the property sold is situated. The notice must be served at least eight days before the application. If it is shown to the court by affidavit that service upon any person required to be served cannot be made with due diligence, notice may be given to that person in any manner which the court directs.

       Claim for the sale of fresh water to debtors well operations was entitled to a statutory well lien because fresh water was used by debtors in the fracking process by which debtors forced water mixed with other components into the well to crack the shale, thereby releasing the oil and gas contained therein, and was also used by debtors for maintenance of the wells by forcing it down the well bore to dissolve salt and other sediments which could otherwise clog the well.

       Claim for amounts due under a Revenue Commitment Agreement post-petition was not entitled to statutory well lien status because the amounts due under the Revenue Commitment Agreement were not for the past services performed by claimant in building debtors’ pipelines.

       Claim for services it provided to debtor, including the transportation of oil, gas and water to and from the wellpad, the additional processing of those products at facilities constructed by claimant on debtors’ leaseholds to prepare them for sale at market, and the transportation and disposal of waste water from debtors’ wells at regulated disposal sites, was entitled to statutory well lien status because the services were necessary for debtors to operate legally and were services performed in connection with development and production operations.

        Summary judgment quieting title to oil field company’s pipeline in a suit against its former manager was proper because the manager did not carry his burden to show that he was an independent contractor, and the plain language of the statute did not confer lien rights upon employees, including, inter alia, that the phrase “under contract” became meaningless if not understood to refer only to contracts between pipeline construction contractors and subcontractors.

        District court erred in finding that a materials supplier’s oil and gas liens were invalidated when the well leasehold owners fully paid the general contractor where the general contractor had not breached its contract with the owners, the owners were liable under the contract when the supplier filed its liens, and thus, the owners had assumed the risk of double payment when they paid the general contractor after receiving notice of the liens rather than directly paying the supplier.

      Forfeiture of a leasehold estate does not impair any lien as to material, appurtenances, and fixtures located thereon and to which said lien has attached prior to forfeiture. If a lien provided for in this chapter attaches to an equitable interest or to a legal interest contingent upon the happening of a condition subsequent, failure of such interest to ripen into legal title or such condition subsequent to be fulfilled does not impair any lien as to material, appurtenances, and fixtures located thereon and to which said lien had attached prior to such failure.

      Anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, any lien claimed by virtue of this chapter insofar as it may extend to oil or gas or the proceeds of the sale of oil or gas is not effective against any purchaser of such oil or gas until written notice of such claim has been delivered to such purchaser. Such notice must state the name of the claimant, the claimant’s address, the amount for which the lien is claimed, and a description of the leasehold upon which the lien is claimed. Such notice must be delivered personally to the purchaser or by registered or certified letter deposited in the United States mails. Until such notice is delivered as above provided, no such purchaser is liable to the claimant for any oil or gas produced from the leasehold upon which the lien is claimed or the proceeds thereof except to the extent of such part of the purchase price of such oil or gas or the proceeds thereof as may be owing by such purchaser at the time of delivery of such written notice. Such purchaser shall withhold payments for such oil or gas runs to the extent of the lien amount claimed until delivery of notice in writing that the claim has been paid.

      Nothing in this chapter may be deemed to fix a greater liability upon an owner in favor of any claimant under an original contractor than the amount for which the owner would be liable to the original contractor; provided, however, that the risk of all payments made to the original contractor is upon the owner after the receipt of notice that a lien is claimed by a person other than the original contractor; and provided further, that an owner does not have the right to offset obligations of the original contractor unless such obligations arise out of the original contract.

       Whenever any lien or liens are fixed or attempted to be fixed under the provisions of this chapter, then the owner of the property on which the lien or liens are claimed or the contractor or subcontractor through whom such lien or liens are claimed, or either of them, may file a bond with the recorder of the county in which the property is located as herein provided. Such bond must describe the property on which lien or liens are claimed, must refer to the lien or liens claimed in a manner sufficient to identify them, must be in double the amount of the claimed lien or liens referred to, and must be payable to the party or parties claiming same. Such bond must be executed by the party filing same as principal and by a corporate surety authorized under the laws of this state to execute such bonds as surety and must be conditioned substantially that the principal and surety will pay to the obligees named or their assigns the amounts of the liens so claimed by them with all costs in the event same are proven to be liens on such property.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c35-24s35-24-13ol12">
       Upon the filing of such bond, the person that posted the bond shall send a notice thereof, together with a copy of the bond, to all obligees named therein, by registered or certified mail addressed to such obligees at the address set forth in their respective claims for lien.

      <li id="t35c35-24s35-24-13ol13">

       Such bond, when filed, takes the place of the property against which any claim for lien referred to in such bond is asserted. At any time within the period of time provided in section 35-24-14, any person claiming such lien may sue upon such bond but no action may be brought upon such bond after the expiration of such period. One action upon said bond does not exhaust the remedies thereon but each obligee or assignee of an obligee named therein may maintain a separate suit thereon in any court having jurisdiction.

      <p>
       Legislature did not intend the lienholder to recover all of the costs and attorney’s fees arising out of the lawsuit when the suit upon the bond was not the only disputed claim; a lienholder who recovers in a suit upon the bond is limited under subsection (5) to recovering only the reasonable attorney’s fees for work associated with pursuing the claim on the bond. Rocky Mt. Steel Founds., Inc. v. Brockett Co., LLC, 2019 ND 252, 934 N.W.2d 531, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court did not abuse its discretion in awarding a corporation the attorney’s fees incurred before the prior appeal because the corporation was entitled to the attorney’s fees incurred in pursuing its claim on a bond, but it was not entitled to attorney’s fees for work on unrelated claims; the corporation had not explained how its work on the suit on the bond was relevant to its breach of contract and quantum meruit claims or its claim to enforce a personal guaranty. Rocky Mt. Steel Founds., Inc. v. Brockett Co., LLC, 2019 ND 252, 934 N.W.2d 531, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court misapplied the law and abused its discretion by failing to award a corporation reasonable appellate attorney’s fees for a prior appeal because the corporation successfully appealed the district court’s prior decision invalidating the liens and was entitled to attorney’s fees for the prior appeal. Rocky Mt. Steel Founds., Inc. v. Brockett Co., LLC, 2019 ND 252, 934 N.W.2d 531, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lienholder, who successfully appeals a district court’s judgment and ultimately recovers in a suit upon the bond as a result of the appeal, is entitled to attorney’s fees for the district court proceedings under subsection (5) and also should not have their recovery diluted by the costs of the attorney’s fees on appeal; the purpose of the statute would be undermined if the recovery could be diluted by the attorney’s fees incurred on appeal. Rocky Mt. Steel Founds., Inc. v. Brockett Co., LLC, 2019 ND 252, 934 N.W.2d 531, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 2019).

      <p>
       Supreme court was unable to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in denying a corporation the attorney’s fees it incurred on remand because the district court did not provide any explanation for failing to award the corporation any of the attorney’s fees it incurred on remand, Rocky Mt.

       In a quiet title action in which an oil field construction company appealed a district court’s denial of its motion for attorney fees, N.D.C.C. § 35-24-19 did not provide for an award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party in a quiet title action. Oil &amp; Gas Transfer L.L.C. v. Karr, 929 F.3d 949, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 20377 (8th Cir. N.D. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court erred by awarding an oil pipeline lienholder attorney fees and costs because a favorable judgment was a prerequisite to an award of attorney fees and costs. Furthermore, the judgment which the lienholder obtained in another state did not support an award of fees and costs because the judgment was statutorily required be entered in an action brought to enforce the lien. 2021 ND 95, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        It was unnecessary to define the term “improvement to real property” because only one conclusion — that the grain bin was an improvement to real property — could reasonably be drawn, where the bin was a 10,000-bushel bin anchored to a cement slab by bolts, with a perforated floor nine inches above the cement slab upon which the bin rested, part of a grain-handling system which also consisted of two additional 10,000-bushel bins, a 3,500-bushel overhead bin, two hopper bins, and a leg, and since the bin was erected in 1967, the owner had never moved it or removed any of the anchors.

        Since in the process of providing his surveying services, surveyor engaged in several activities which physically altered and affected owner’s property, including locating all existing markers and driving several survey stakes into the ground, these surveying acts constituted improvements. Therefore the surveying was done “in connection with” improvements, satisfied the definition in subsection 2 of this section and was entitled to the protection of the mechanic’s lien.

    Persons entitled to construction lien — Notice.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person that improves real estate, whether under contract with the owner of such real estate or under contract with any agent, trustee, contractor, or subcontractor of the owner, has a lien upon the improvement and upon the land on which the improvement is situated or to which the improvement may be removed for the price or value of such contribution. Provided, however, that the amount of the lien is only for the difference between the price paid by the owner or agent and the price or value of the contribution. If the owner or agent has paid the full price or value of the contribution, no lien is allowed. Provided further that if the owner or an agent of the owner has received a waiver of lien signed by the person that improves the real estate, a lien is not allowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person that extends credit or makes a contract with any agent, trustee, contractor, or subcontractor of the owner for the improvement of real estate, upon demand, has the right to request and secure evidence of the legal description of the real estate upon which the improvement is located, including the name of the title owner of the real estate. Written notice that a lien will be claimed must be given to the owner of the real estate by certified mail at least ten days before the recording of the construction lien.

        Whether a construction company's unjust enrichment claim against a developer should have been dismissed due to the availability of a construction lien was not considered on appeal because this precise issue was not presented to the trial court, as the issue was more complicated than whether the company believed the company could file such a lien.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When land is sold under an executory contract requiring the vendee to improve the same and such contract is forfeited or surrendered after liens have attached by reason of such improvements, the title of the vendor is subject thereto, but the vendor is not personally liable if the contract was made in good faith. When improvements are made by one person upon the land of another, all persons interested therein otherwise than as bona fide prior encumbrancers or lienors are deemed to have authorized such improvements, insofar as to subject their interests to liens therefor. Any person who has not authorized the same may protect the person’s interest from such liens by serving upon the person doing work or otherwise contributing to such improvement within five days after knowledge thereof, written notice that the improvement is not being made at the person’s instance, or by posting like notice, and keeping the same posted, in a conspicuous place on the premises. As against a lessor no lien is given for repairs made by or at the instance of the lessor’s lessee, unless the lessor has actual or constructive notice thereof and does not object thereto.

     <p>
      In addition to the lien provided by this chapter, but subject to the conditions of section 35-27-02, when material is furnished or labor performed in the erection or construction of an original, complete, and independent building, structure, or improvement, whether the same is placed upon a foundation or not, the lien attaches to the building or improvement in preference to any prior title, claim, lien, encumbrance, or mortgage upon the land upon which the building, erection, or improvement is erected. Upon the foreclosure of the lien, the building or improvement may be sold separately from the land and may be removed from the land within thirty days after the sale. The sale and removal of a structure or improvement separately from the land operates as a full satisfaction and discharge of the lien upon the real estate. At the time the material is furnished for such improvement, the seller shall notify the purchaser by delivering to the purchaser a written notice stating that the seller claims the right to foreclose the lien under the laws of the state, and in the event that there is a default in payment for the improvement, to remove the building from the real estate upon which it is placed regardless of whether or not said building is placed upon a foundation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person having a lien by virtue of this chapter may bring an action to enforce the lien in the district court of the county in which the property is situated. Any number of persons claiming liens against the same property may join in the action and when separate actions are commenced the court may consolidate the actions. Before a lienholder may enforce a lien, the lienholder shall give written notice of the lienholder’s intention so to do, which notice must be given by personal service upon the record owner of the property affected at least ten days before an action to enforce the lien is commenced, or by registered mail directed to the owner’s last-known address at least twenty days before the action is commenced. The judgment may direct that in the event that a deficiency remains after the sale of the real property subject to the lien an execution may issue for such deficiency.

Under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t35c35-27s35-27-24" target="_self">35-27-24.</a></cite>1, a party who successfully contests the accuracy or validity of a construction lien is limited to recovering only those costs and fees reasonably expended contesting the lien.

        Trial court properly found that a property owner had successfully contested the accuracy of a construction lien where the jury had awarded the contractor approximately $ 17,000 less than it claimed under the lien.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court misconstrued the fees and costs statute when it seemed to conclude that if proof went to both the amount owed under the parties’
   contract and the correct amount of a contractor’s construction lien against the owner’s property, the owner could not recover attorney fees and costs, because the owner was entitled to attorney fees and costs associated with work done to challenge the construction lien, even if such work was also relevant to other causes of action, but not for work on unrelated claims.

     <p>
      Upon written demand by or on behalf of the owner which has been delivered to the lienor and filed with the county recorder, suit must be commenced and filed and a lis pendens as provided in chapter 28-05 must be recorded within thirty days after the date of delivery of the demand or the lien is forfeited. This thirty-day requirement applies regardless of the method of delivery and additional time may not be allowed based on the method of delivery. The demand must inform the lienor that if suit is not commenced and a lis pendens recorded within the thirty days required under this section, the lien is forfeited. A lien is not valid, effective, nor enforceable, unless the lienor commences an action and records with the county recorder a lis pendens within three years after the date of recording of the lien. If a lis pendens is not recorded within the limitations provided by this section, the lien is deemed satisfied.

        Contractor forfeits a construction lien created and attached as a matter of law when it fails to comply with a demand to enforce the lien. Therefore, a contractor was unable to file a construction lien against property without performing additional work when it failed to respond to a demand. Snider v. Brinkman, 2017 ND 31, 889 N.W.2d 867, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 2017).

       <p>
        The plain and ordinary meaning of “serve” contemplates that a written demand is served within the meaning of this section when the demand is delivered and notice is given to the person holding the lien. Comstock Constr., Inc. v. Sheyenne Disposal, Inc., 2002 ND 141, 651 N.W.2d 656, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because service of the written demand effectively results in the commencement and filing of an action to enforce the mechanic’s lien, the provisions for service of process in N.D.R.Civ.P. 4 apply to measure when the written demand is served. Comstock Constr., Inc. v. Sheyenne Disposal, Inc., 2002 ND 141, 651 N.W.2d 656, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Dakota Legislature intended the provisions for additional time after service by mail under N.D.R.Civ.P. 6(e) to apply when an owner chooses to serve a written demand of a mechanics’ lien by registered mail under this provision.

    Agricultural processor’s lien authorized.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person who processes any crop or agricultural product is entitled to a lien upon the crop or product processed for the reasonable value of the services performed. A lien taken pursuant to this section upon anything other than the crop or product processed is void. As used in this chapter, the term “processor” includes persons threshing, combining, drying, or harvesting any crop or agricultural product. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the agricultural processor’s lien is effective from the date the processing is completed. An agricultural processor’s lien filed as a security interest created by contract to secure money advanced or loaned for any purpose is not effective to secure a priority over liens filed under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t35c35-05s35-05-01" target="_self">35-05-01.</a></cite> This chapter does not limit the sale, assignment, or transfer of an agricultural processor’s lien. However, the priority of an effective agricultural processor’s lien is not transferable. After sale, assignment, or transfer, the priority of an effective agricultural processor’s lien is to be determined as of the date the lien was filed and in accordance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.41.html#t41c41-09s41-09-33" target="_blank">41-09-33.</a></cite>

      </p>
      <p>
       Section 50 of chapter 257, S.L. 2013 provides:
       <b>
        “CONTINGENT EFFECTIVE DATE.
       </b>
       Sections 1 through 27 and sections 29 through 47 of this Act become effective August 1, 2015, or earlier if the secretary of state makes a report to the legislative management and to the information technology committee certifying that the information technology components of the electronic filing system are ready for implementation of those provisions of this Act, in which case those sections become effective ninety days following the completion of the certificate requirement.”
      </p>
      <p>
       A court cannot, under guise of construction, absolve lien claimant from duty of complying with statutory requirements as basis for existence of lien. Carlson v. Powers Elevator Co., 61 N.D. 438, 238 N.W. 548, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 294</cite> (N.D. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for wrongful conversion of personal property on which plaintiff claims a thresher’s lien, the debt or demand, based on a contract having no connection with the transaction set forth in the complaint, is not available as a counterclaim. Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. v. Amenia Seed &amp; Grain Co., 54 N.D. 153, 209 N.W. 234, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Landlord of one employing thresher is not required to be named in lien. Dahlund v. Lorentzen, 30 N.D. 275, 152 N.W. 684, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person who is entitled to a threshing lien must include in statement to be filed debtor’s name, correctly spelled, in order to file and index lien under first letter of surname. Schatz v. Kintyre Farmers' Co-op. Elevator Co., 52 N.D. 290, 202 N.W. 855, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the owner and operator of threshing machine is entitled to thresher’s lien, and statement required to be filed must contain description of the land. Parker v. First Nat'l Bank, 3 N.D. 87, 54 N.W. 313, 1892 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 1892); Martin v. Hawthorn, 3 N.D. 412, 57 N.W. 87, 1893 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       One is estopped from asserting a thresher’s lien against an elevator where, before filing statement, claimant accompanies owner to elevator and remains silent while owner sells grain and receives payment therefor. Branthover v. Monarch Elevator Co., 33 N.D. 454, 156 N.W. 927, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien exists from commencement of threshing, and person who purchases grain within thirty-day period takes it subject to lien, although statement was not filed at time of purchase. Warren v. Olson, 46 N.D. 203, 180 N.W. 529, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 65</cite> (N.D. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       The thresher’s lien statute gives to a thresher an inchoate lien for a thirty-day period after completion of the threshing, although lien statement is not on file. Rogers Lumber Co. v. Schatzel, 52 N.D. 837, 204 N.W. 854, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       If grain threshed is grown in two counties, the statement required to be filed must be executed in duplicate and one copy filed in each county. Gorthy v. Jarvis, 15 N.D. 509, 108 N.W. 39, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 55</cite> (N.D. 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       A misstatement of the quantity of grain threshed does not invalidate a thresher’s lien properly filed, if misstatement resulted honestly without fraudulent intent. Murie v. National Elevator Co., 60 N.D. 665, 236 N.W. 269, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       A thresher’s lien is purely of statutory origin, and one who claims such a lien must bring himself under terms of statute authorizing its creation. Moher v. Rasmusson, 12 N.D. 71, 95 N.W. 152, 1903 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 11</cite> (N.D. 1903).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a thresher is engaged to thresh grain, he need not investigate to ascertain what liens or encumbrances there may be outstanding against the grain, for he knows that he is given security upon grain threshed for amount of threshing bill, and this without regard to existing liens or encumbrances. Mace v. Cole, 50 N.D. 866, 198 N.W. 816, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 41</cite> (N.D. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of a lien claimant whose lien is satisfied while in an inchoate state to file lien statement under this section does not render right of one discharging claim subject to inferior liens. Rogers Lumber Co. v. Schatzel, 52 N.D. 837, 204 N.W. 854, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       To uphold a seizure of grain under a thresher’s lien, party making seizure must show that grain seized was grown upon land described in statement for the lien. Martin v. Hawthorne, 5 N.D. 66, 63 N.W. 895, 1895 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to set forth amount and quantity of grain threshed in statement filed is fatal to the lien. Moher v. Rasmusson, 12 N.D. 71, 95 N.W. 152, 1903 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 11</cite> (N.D. 1903); Brodina v. Vranek, 50 N.D. 420, 196 N.W. 311, 1923 <cite class="nd_code"><cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 11</cite>5</cite> (N.D. 1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       The quantity of each grain threshed need not be stated in thresher’s lien if total amount is stated. Mitchell v. Monarch Elevator Co., 15 N.D. 495, 107 N.W. 1085, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statement is not required to specify amount of each kind of grain threshed, when amount of lien claimed appears definitely by computation from facts given in statement. Mitchell v. Monarch Elevator Co., 15 N.D. 495, 107 N.W. 1085, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1906).
      </p>
      <p>
       A failure to comply with thresher’s lien statute is fatal to the lien. Auth v. Kuroki Elevator Co., 40 N.D. 533, 169 N.W. 80, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 99</cite> (N.D. 1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not require a lien statement to show that parties agreed upon a certain price per bushel for threshing, and agreement to pay thresher by hour does not invalidate the lien. Hiam v. Andrews Grain Co., 48 N.D. 250, 183 N.W. 1016, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Verified by oath”, as used in thresher’s lien statute, means that oath must be administered by an authorized official to party claiming lien, and such party must indicate that he knows he is taking the oath. Agricultural Bond &amp; Credit Corp. v. Courtenay Farmers' Coop. Ass'n, 64 N.D. 253, 251 N.W. 881, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 272</cite>, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 273</cite> (N.D. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       The thresher’s lien of a lessee under a cropper’s contract is not waived by delivery at an elevator according to contract, although it results in commingling. Blank v. Fenton, 54 N.D. 837, 211 N.W. 590, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a farm laborer delivered grain on which he claimed a lien to elevator in performance of his work, he did not waive his right to lien. Wonser v. Walden Farmers' Elevator Co., 31 N.D. 382, 153 N.W. 1012, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1915).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person who furnishes supplies used in the production of crops, agricultural products, or livestock is entitled to a lien upon the crops, products produced by the use of the supplies, and livestock and their products including milk. As used in this chapter, the term “supplies” includes seed, petroleum products, fertilizer, farm chemicals, insecticide, feed, hay, pasturage, veterinary services, or the furnishing of services in delivering or applying the supplies. Except as otherwise provided in this section, an agricultural supplier’s lien filed in accordance with section 35-31-02 is effective from the date the supplies are furnished or the services performed. An agricultural supplier’s lien filed as a security interest created by contract to secure money advanced or loaned for any purposes is not effective to secure a priority over liens filed under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t35c35-05s35-05-01" target="_self">35-05-01.</a></cite> This chapter does not limit the sale, assignment, or transfer of an agricultural supplier’s lien. However, the priority of an effective agricultural supplier’s lien is not transferable from the original lienholder. After sale, assignment, or transfer, the priority of an effective agricultural supplier’s lien is to be determined as of the date the lien was filed and in accordance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.41.html#t41c41-09s41-09-33" target="_blank">41-09-33.</a></cite>

       <p>
        Agricultural supplier’s lien was properly filed for the cost of aerial spraying by an agent of a supplier since it was the furnishing of services in delivering or applying the supplies; there was no contrary evidence furnished to raise a disputed issue of material fact about the sprayer’s agency relationship with the supplier.

        Credit company was permitted to file an agricultural supplier’s lien for supplies, even though it was not the seller of such, because it was an agent for the seller, pursuant to an agency agreement. The credit company was the actual agent of the seller for the purpose of collecting account receivables, which gave it the authority to file such a lien.

        Credit company was not precluded from having super priority status for an agricultural supplier’s lien where it was the agent of a supplier for the purpose of collecting account receivables because the structure of the relationship between the supplier and the credit company showed that their transactions with a farm were not for “money advanced or loaned” within the meaning of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t35c35-31s35-31-01" target="_self">35-31-01.</a></cite> The farm never received any money from the supplier or the credit company.

        Where, although defendants provided debtors with an operating loan, there was no evidence that defendants made a credit sale to the debtors for their purchase of seed, fertilizer or any other input, it did not furnish supplies in the sense contemplated by this section and thus any lien claimed by reason of its agricultural supplier’s lien failed. Drewes v. Lesmeister (In re Lesmeister), 242 B.R. 920, 1999 Bankr. LEXIS 1650 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1999).

        Liberally construing N.D.C.C. § 35-31-01 as a whole to protect those furnishing supplies used for the production of crops, agricultural products, or livestock and consistent with the ordinary definition of “includes,” the term “supplies” is not limited only to the specific items listed in therein. Therefore, a trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a supplier in a lien dispute because poults were “supplies” where they were directly used to produce a mature flock of marketable turkeys.

        Summary judgment dismissing a seed supplier’s claim to proceeds from a sugar beet crop grown by a farm was reversed and remanded because the supplier substantially complied with the requirements for an agricultural supplier’s lien under N.D.C.C. § 35-31-02, when the farm had actual knowledge that a lien could be filed if it did not pay the supplier.

     <p>
      To obtain an agricultural supplier’s lien, except an agricultural supplier’s lien for furnishing petroleum products, the person entitled to the lien, within one hundred twenty days after the supplies are furnished or the services performed, shall file electronically a statement in the central notice system. To obtain an agricultural supplier’s lien for furnishing and delivering petroleum products, the person entitled to the lien, within one hundred fifty days after the petroleum products are furnished or delivered, shall file electronically a statement in the central notice system. The statement must contain the following information:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t35c35-31s35-31-02ol11">
       The name and address of the person to whom the supplies were furnished.

      <li id="t35c35-31s35-31-02ol13">
       A description of the crops, agricultural products, or livestock and their amount or number, if known, subject to the lien together with a reasonable description, including the county as to the location of the crops, agricultural products, or livestock and the year the crop is to be harvested or was harvested.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c35-31s35-31-02ol14">
       A description and value of the supplies and the first date furnished.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c35-31s35-31-02ol15">
       The social security number or, in the case of a debtor doing business other than as an individual, the internal revenue service taxpayer identification number of the person to whom the supplies were furnished.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The secretary of state shall provide an electronic means to obtain a lien under this section or gain protection under the central notice system, or both. Before a supplier’s lien is filed, a billing statement for the supplies furnished must include notice to the agricultural producer that if the amount due to the agricultural supplier is not satisfied a lien may be filed.

        Where a farm lessee placed a lien on the farm purchaser’s grain preventing the purchaser from being able to sell his grain, the court’s award of damages to the purchaser on his claim of unlawful interference with a business relationship against the lessee was not clearly erroneous because, even though the lien was legally invalid under N.D.C.C. § 35-31-02, the lessee had knowledge of the business relationship between the purchaser and the granary, the lessee treated the lien as valid, and the purchaser incurred interest expenses of $ 13,037 and storage expenses of $ 15,857 because his operating loan was extended due to his inability to sell a sufficient amount of grain to pay the loan.

        District court was not precluded from finding that a farm lessee unlawfully and intentionally interfered with the farm purchaser’s business relationships when he filed an agricultural supplier’s lien against the purchaser’s grain, even though the lien was legally invalid against him individually since his social security number was not listed on the lien, because although the lessee admitted that the purchaser was the wrong person to name on the lien, the lessee refused to remove his name from the lien after the purchaser requested that he do so and the granary with whom the purchaser was dealing refused to remit a check to the purchaser without the lessee’s name being on it.

      If the occupant is in default, the owner may deny the occupant access to the storage space and enforce the lien by selling the property stored in the storage space. Sale of the property may be by public or private proceeding and may also be as a unit or in parcels. After the proceeding, the owner may dispose of any property that was offered for sale but which remained unsold.

     <p>
      The owner of a portable storage unit has a lien on all personal property stored under a rental agreement in a portable storage unit for rent, labor, and other charges, and for expenses reasonably incurred in the sale or other disposition of the property under law. This lien is superior to other security interests except those perfected before the date the lien attaches. The lien attaches upon default by the occupant as stated in the notice of default served on the occupant as provided in this chapter.
