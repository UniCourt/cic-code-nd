       </h5>
       <p>
        If nonperishable bailed goods are lost or destroyed while in the possession of a bailee for hire, and this is shown by the plaintiff, a presumption of negligence as well as an inference of negligence on the part of the bailee arises, and bailee must then go forward with the evidence to show in what manner the property was lost or destroyed. If such evidence by the bailee shows due care on his part, the presumption is overcome, but the inference of negligence remains, to be weighed against the evidence of nonnegligence. McKenzie v. Hanson, 143 N.W.2d 697 (N.D. 1966), decided prior to the adoption of N.D.R.Ev. 301; distinguished, Foerster v. Fischbach-Moore, Inc., 178 N.W.2d 258, 1970 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1970).

        Proprietor of repair shop must exercise at least ordinary care in preservation of vehicle entrusted to him for repair. Reservation Motor Corp. v. Mayer, 77 N.D. 431, 43 N.W.2d 537, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1950).

       <p>
        Where plaintiffs’ automobiles were destroyed by fire while in the defendant’s repair shop, a possible inference of negligence remains even though the defendant has overcome the presumption of negligence that attaches to bailees for hire upon their failure to redeliver the bailed property upon demand, and where plaintiff shows that the fire started inside the repair shop, that only defendant and his employees had been in the garage on the day of the fire, and that defendant’s housekeeping habits were average or below-average at the repair shop, plaintiff has sustained the burden of proof as to the inference.

        This chapter is a statute for the regulation of grain and seed warehouses.
   N.D.C.C. § 41-07-03 as well as
   N.D.C.C. § 41-07-10(4) make reference to its provisions, making it clear that N.D.C.C. ch. 41-07 must be read in conjunction with this chapter, and to the extent they are at variance this chapter overrides N.D.C.C. ch. 41-07.

         Interpretation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Based upon the North Dakota Supreme Court’s interpretation of N.D.C.C. ch. 60-02 and N.D.C.C. ch. 60-04, to be a “receiptholder” entitled to benefit from the trust fund under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t60c60-04s60-04-03" target="_self">60-04-03.</a></cite>1, transactions with a public warehouseman must at least designate the warehouse for which the public warehouseman is licensed and bonded in the state. The North Dakota Supreme Court rejects a contention that the North Dakota trust fund and the North Dakota bond may benefit anyone who sold grain to a warehouseman, irrespective of the state in which the facility was located; the designated location of the warehouse is crucial, particularly where bond protection is determined by the warehouse for which a receipt is issued.

       If any dispute or disagreement arises between the person receiving and the person delivering grain at any public warehouse in this state as to the proper grade, dockage, vomitoxin level, moisture content, or protein content of any grain, an average sample of at least three pints of the grain in dispute may be taken together by both parties interested. The sample must be certified by each party as a true and representative sample of the grain in dispute on the day the grain was delivered. The sample must be forwarded in a suitable container by parcel post or express, prepaid with the name and address of both parties for inspection by a federal licensed inspector, or a mutually agreed-upon third party, who will examine the grain and adjudge what grade, dockage, vomitoxin level, moisture content, or protein content the sample of grain is entitled to under the inspection rules and grades adopted by the secretary of agriculture of the United States. The person requesting the inspection service shall pay for the inspection. If the grain in question is damp, otherwise out of condition, or if moisture content is in dispute, the sample must be placed in an airtight container. Payment for the grain involved in the dispute must be made and accepted on the basis of the determination made by the federal licensed inspector or third party. However, all other quality factors may also be considered in determining the price of the grain. An appeal of the determination made by a third party other than a federal licensed inspector may be made to a federal licensed inspector. An appeal of the determination made by a federal licensed inspector may be made as provided under the United States Grain Standards Act [Pub. L. 103-354; 108 Stat. 3237; 7 U.S.C. 79(c) and (d)] and under 7 CFR 800.125-800.140.

     <p>
      A licensed public warehouseman may establish a receiving station without a separate warehouse license for that facility if all of the following conditions are met:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-07.5ol11">
       The station is colocated with another licensed public warehouse, the operator of which will take delivery of the grain on behalf of the warehouseman who established the receiving station.
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-07.5ol12">
       The storage space used by the receiving station is used solely by the receiving station and is not licensed as part of the warehouse that is located at that site.
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-07.5ol13">
       The grain taken in by the receiving station is not commingled with other grain at that site.
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-07.5ol14">
       The warehouseman establishing the station requests and receives permission from the commissioner to increase licensed capacity to include the space to be used at the receiving station.
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-07.5ol15">
       Grain received at the receiving station is recorded on scale tickets issued by the warehouseman who established the station and is covered by that warehouseman’s bond.
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-07.5ol16">
       Warehouse-receipted grain received at the receiving station is available for redelivery to the receiptholder at that location even if the station has been closed. A charge for redelivery must be stated in the warehouseman’s redelivery policy.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The storage space used by a receiving station need not be physically disconnected from the facilities of the other licensed warehouse located at that site.

        N.D.C.C. § 60-04-09 authorized the deduction from trust fund assets of expenses incurred by the public service commission (commission), and the bonding company was also liable for any other fees or costs; furthermore, the trial court did not err in accepting the commission’s report and recommendation, which did not provide for offsets under N.D.C.C. § 60-04-09, other than as to one claim.

        Under statutes governing grain warehouses, grain receipt holders are entitled to be made whole, if possible, when a warehouseman becomes insolvent. A warehouseman is required to furnish a bond to provide that protection to producers who deliver grain for sale or storage, and the surety is liable under the bond to the extent necessary to make the receipt holders whole after deducting what they have received from the bankruptcy trustee.

       In light of the obvious purpose of the warehouseman statutes, and in order to give the 1971 amendment a meaning consistent with the overall statutory scheme, under subdivision (7) a public warehouseman has a duty to disclose to producers entering into deferred payments contracts or other credit arrangements the risks of doing so.

       Warehouseman’s bonds are not intended for the benefit of secured creditors of the warehouseman.

        A surety’s liability on a bond is conditioned on the faithful performance of a public warehouseman’s duties under the law. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. Valley Farmers Bean Ass’n, 365 N.W.2d 528 (N.D. 1985), decided prior to the 1983 and 1985 amendments to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        A surety is responsible for the obligations of the warehouseman incurred through the operation of its warehouse regardless of where the physical acceptance and control of the grain took place. Therefore, persons who delivered beans to locations other than warehouseman’s bonded warehouses, but who received scale tickets with a warehouse designation of Portland or Buxton, where the warehouseman’s elevators were located, have valid claims against the trust fund and the warehouseman’s bonds. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. Valley Farmers Bean Ass’n, 365 N.W.2d 528 (N.D. 1985), decided prior to the 1983 and 1985 amendments to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where grain was in good condition when the warehouse filed its bankruptcy petition, and deterioration of the grain took place while it was in the custody of the bankruptcy trustee, the surety was not liable for any loss suffered by a creditor as a result of deterioration in the quality of the grain while it was in the custody and control of the bankruptcy trustee; under this section and N.D.C.C. § 60-04-02, the warehouse’s surety was required to insure only the warehouse’s faithful performance of its duties as a public warehouseman, and was not required to insure the faithful performance of the bankruptcy trustee’s duties.

       <p>
        Although subdivision 7 also excludes “other credit arrangements” from bond coverage, grower agreements do not fall within the statutory provision. The phrase “or other credit arrangements” does not necessarily expand the meaning of “deferred payments contracts”. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm’n v.

        Whether or not a transaction constitutes a deferred payment contract or other credit arrangement depends not only on a delay in payment following delivery, but also on the expectations and intentions of the parties to the agreement. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. Valley Farmers Bean Ass’n, 365 N.W.2d 528 (N.D. 1985), decided prior to the 1983 and 1985 amendments to this section.

       <p>
        Although the contract provision specified that three payments shall be made following delivery, the inclusion of the phrase “unless deferred payment is requested by Grower” clearly indicated that neither the public warehouseman, the drafter of the agreement, nor the producers considered the grower agreements to be deferred payment contracts. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. Valley Farmers Bean Ass’n, 365 N.W.2d 528 (N.D. 1985), decided prior to the 1983 and 1985 amendments to this section.
       </p>
       <p>
        Grower contracts providing for payment within thirty days of delivery did not constitute deferred payments contracts or other credit arrangements within the meaning of this section as it read prior to amendments in 1983 and 1985, and the unpaid producers who entered into these agreements were therefore entitled to bond coverage.

       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of a public warehouseman to convert scale tickets into cash or storage tickets as required by law constitutes a violation of subdivision 4 for which the surety is liable. The scale tickets were properly considered as evidence of proof of the producers’ claims. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm’n v.

       <p>
        Fact that some claimants who delivered sunflowers to warehouseman received only scale tickets as evidence of their deliveries did not mean that these persons authorized a time delay between delivery and their right to receive payment so as to enter into deferred payment contracts or other credit arrangements and render them not entitled to bond coverage, as a grain warehouseman’s failure to convert scale tickets into either cash or storage tickets as required by N.D.C.C. § 60-02-11 does not result in a loss to the producers, but constitutes a violation by the warehouseman of this section, for which the surety is liable.

        Producers who entered into 10/10 contracts with a public warehouseman did not fall within the category of persons who entered into “deferred payments contracts or other credit arrangements” under subdivision 7.

       <p>
        Where the 10/10 contracts did not inform the producers that by the acceptance of its provisions, the producers would be surrendering their rights of coverage under the warehouseman’s bonds, by its failure to so inform the producers in the terms of the agreement, the public warehouseman breached its duties under subdivision 4. Because the warehouseman statutes were designed to protect the producers, the violation of subdivision 4 takes precedence over the subdivision 7 exemption provision of the statute, and the surety was liable to those producers who entered into the 10/10 contracts without written notice that they would be giving up their rights to bond coverage.

       Where a party purchases grain from a warehouseman without taking delivery and receives warehouse receipts as evidence of the sale, the warehouse receipts are valid claims against an insolvent warehouseman, even though the receipt holder did not actually deliver grain to the warehouse in return for the receipts. However, this does not alter the fundamental principle that the party to whom the warehouse receipt is issued must have an ownership interest in the grain described on the warehouse receipt. An ownership interest is not synonymous with a security interest. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm’n v.

       A warehouseman shall publish and post, in a conspicuous place in its warehouse, the fees that will be assessed for receiving, storing, processing, or redelivering grain and the termination date of its warehouse receipts. This publication must be filed with the commissioner as a part of the warehouse license process or annual renewal. The fees and termination date must be stated on the warehouse receipt issued for the grain. The fees or termination date may be changed upon filing a revised publication with the commissioner.

      This grain is received, insured, and stored subject to the laws and rules of the state of North Dakota, the terms of this contract, and the charges and conditions stated herein and as filed with the North Dakota agriculture commissioner. Upon surrender of this receipt and payment or tender of all applicable charges, the amount, kind, and grade of grain identified in this receipt will be delivered to the person named above or the person’s order as rapidly as due diligence, care, and prudence will permit. At the option of the holder of this receipt, the amount, kind, and grade of grain for which this receipt is issued, upon demand, must be delivered back to the holder at any terminal point customarily shipped to, or at the place where received, upon the payment of any charges for receiving, handling, storage, and insurance and in case of terminal delivery, the payment in addition to the above of the regular freight charges on the gross amount called for by this ticket or in lieu thereof, a receipt issued by a bonded warehouse or elevator company doing business at the terminal point. This receipt does not require the delivery of the identical grain specified herein, but an equal amount of grain of the same kind and grade must be delivered.

        Plain language of the definition of a credit-sale contract in N.D.C.C. § 60-04-01(2) is part of the statutory framework for insolvency proceedings and explicitly requires a written contract containing the notice required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t60c60-02s60-02-19" target="_self">60-02-19.</a></cite>1(7). The reference in N.D.C.C. § 60-04-01(2) to only one specific subsection of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t60c60-02s60-02-19" target="_self">60-02-19.</a></cite>1 evidences an intent to include only that subsection in the definition of a credit-sale contract for purposes of the priorities in an insolvency proceeding. Moreover, when considered as a whole with N.D.C.C. ch. 60-02, the plain language of N.D.C.C. § 60-02-19.1 is a prohibition against a warehouseman purchasing grain by a credit-sale contract except as provided in that section and not a definition of a credit-sale contract that would replace the definition for an insolvency proceeding in N.D.C.C. § 60-04-01(2).

      A public warehouseman is liable to the owner for the delivery of the kind, grade, quality, and quantity of grain called for by the warehouse receipt. Unless otherwise agreed, the value of any difference in kind, grade, quality, and quantity must be settled at the price on the local market on the day the warehouseman receives written request for delivery. The warehouseman may withhold from delivery a sufficient quantity of grain, based upon the local market price, to satisfy the value of any difference in kind, grade, or quality.

      Grain contained in a warehouse, including grain owned by the warehouseman, is subject to a first priority lien in favor of outstanding receiptholders storing, selling, or depositing grain in the warehouse. The lien created under this section shall be preferred to any lien or security interest in favor of any creditor of the warehouseman regardless of the time when the creditor’s lien or security interest attached to the grain. Notice of the lien created under this section need not be filed in order to perfect the lien. The lien created by this section is discharged as to grain sold by the warehouseman to a buyer in the ordinary course of business. Such sale does not discharge the lien in favor of an individual receiptholder in the remaining grain in the warehouse.

        In a bankruptcy proceeding, bank’s interest in and to the proceeds of grain formerly in storage at debtor’s elevator facility was valid only to the extent that its security interest attached to property owned by the elevator, an ownership interest which did not exist where commingled fungible goods were insufficient to satisfy outstanding receiptholders; even if bank’s security interest attached to excess goods of a particular commodity type, it still stood in second priority to the blanket lien given warehouse receiptholders by this section.

     <p>
      If a public warehouseman desires to transfer a warehouse, either by sale or lease to any other individual, firm, or corporation, the warehouseman shall:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-40ol11">
       Notify the commissioner first of the warehouseman’s intention to transfer the warehouse, giving the name and address of the proposed lessee or purchaser.
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-40ol12">
       Furnish a statement of all proper claims that may be filed or pending against the warehouseman pertaining to the storage, inspection, and marketing of grain, together with a statement of:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-40ol12a">
         The number of bushels [cubic meters] of grain of each kind and grade in store in the warehouse;
        </li>
        <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-40ol12b">
         The number and amount of receipts outstanding; and
        </li>
        <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-40ol12c">
         The names and addresses of the receiptholders.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-40ol13">
       Serve notice by registered or certified mail, at least thirty days before the transfer, upon all receiptholders having claims against the warehouse to call for delivery of the grain covered by the receipts, and to pay all storage charges due, the warehouseman in such case to make no charge for redelivery. The commissioner may waive the thirty-day notice period upon receipt of written consent of all receiptholders.
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-40ol14">
       Transfer all stored grain undelivered at the expiration of such thirty-day period to the warehouseman’s successor, if licensed, or to the nearest licensed warehouse for restorage, taking receipts for the same in favor of the owner of the grain so transferred.
      </li>
      <li id="t60c60-02s60-02-40ol15">
       Surrender to the commissioner the warehouseman’s license for cancellation, at which time the proposed lessee or purchaser shall file in due form for a new license and tender a new bond for review by the commissioner, at which time, the commissioner, first being duly satisfied all the outstanding receipts have been redeemed, or that the redemption of all outstanding receipts has been provided for, the commissioner may permit a new license to become effective for the lessee or purchaser.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      No sale, lease, or transfer of any warehouse will be recognized by the commissioner except when made in accordance with the provisions of this section.

      Unless an entire warehouse facility is used for nonpublic purposes, all physically connected portions of the facility must be licensed in accordance with this chapter. The warehouseman shall issue receipt memoranda for all grain received. Facilities that are physically connected to the licensed warehouse may be sold under a condominium arrangement or leased to other entities for nonpublic use and sales and lease agreements must be based on the capacity of the bins involved and not on the number of bushels held in the space. The licensee shall provide contents insurance and bond coverage for the space. In case of licensee insolvency, the contents of the space must be considered an asset to the trust fund established under chapter 60-04 and owners and lessees are entitled to trust fund protection in a manner equal to all other valid grain receiptholders.

       <p>
        Although it is not defined in this section, the supreme court has found that under the plain meaning of the term, a “claimant” is a person who asserts a right to payment for grain sold to a licensee. PSC v. Wimbledon Grain Co., 2003 ND 104, 663 N.W.2d 186, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Ordinary meaning of the statutory language establishes that a claim can be supported by evidence that does not qualify as a receipt under subdivision (8) of this section; the definition of “receipts” comports with the notion that persons entering into credit-sale contracts are entitled to participate in assets of the trust fund other than the bond. PSC v. Wimbledon Grain Co., 2003 ND 104, 663 N.W.2d 186, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       If any dispute or disagreement arises between the person receiving and the person delivering grain as to the proper grade, dockage, vomitoxin level, moisture content, or protein content of any grain, an average sample of at least three pints [1.65 liters] of the grain in dispute may be taken together by both interested parties. The sample must be certified by each party as a true and representative sample of the grain in dispute on the day the grain was transferred. The sample must be forwarded in a suitable container by parcel post or express, prepaid with the name and address of both parties for inspection by a federal licensed inspector, or a mutually agreed-upon third party, who will examine the grain and adjudge what grade, dockage, vomitoxin level, moisture content, or protein content the sample of grain is entitled to under the inspection rules and grades adopted by the secretary of agriculture of the United States. The person requesting the inspection service shall pay for the inspection. If the grain in question is damp, otherwise out of condition, or if moisture content is in dispute, the sample must be placed in an airtight container. Payment for the grain involved in the dispute must be made and accepted on the basis of the determination made by the federal licensed inspector or third party. However, all other quality factors may also be considered in determining the price of the grain. An appeal of the determination made by a third party other than a federal licensed inspector may be made to a federal licensed inspector. An appeal of the determination made by a federal licensed inspector may be made as provided under the United States Grain Standards Act [Pub. L. 103-354; 108 Stat. 3237; 7 U.S.C. 79(c) and (d)] and under 7 CFR 800.125-800.140.

       Because the supreme court defined a claimant as one who asserted a right to payment for grain sold to a licensee, this included farmers group members even though they sold grain to a company on credit sales payable beyond 30 days, and thus they were claimants entitled to participate in the non-bond assets of a trust fund under this section, and the Public Service Commission was obligated to marshal assets for their benefit under
   N.D.C.C. § 60-02.1-34; pursuant to
   N.D.C.C. § 1-02-39(6), the court gave no deference to the Commission’s interpretation of the statutes because the statutes were unambiguous.

If it is in the best interests of the receiptholders, the court may order a surety to deposit some or all of the penal sum of the bond into the trustee’s trust account pending determination of the surety’s liability under the bond.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon the commissioner’s appointment, the commissioner may take possession of relevant books and records of the licensee. If the insolvency involves a roving grain buyer, the commissioner shall publish a notice of the commissioner’s appointment once each week for two consecutive weeks in all daily newspapers in the state and may notify, by ordinary mail, the holders of record of outstanding receipts and those who are potential credit-sale contract claimants, disclosed by the licensee’s records. If the insolvency involves a grain processor, the notice must be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper in the county in which the facility is located. The notice must require outstanding receiptholders and credit-sale contract claimants to file their claims with the commissioner along with the receipts, contracts, or other evidence of the claims required by the commissioner. If an outstanding receiptholder or credit-sale contract claimant fails to submit a claim within forty-five days after the last publication of the notice or a longer time set by the commissioner, the commissioner is relieved of further duty in the administration of the insolvency on behalf of the receiptholder or credit-sale contract claimant and the receiptholder may be barred from participation in the trust fund, and the credit-sale contract claimant may be barred from payment for any amount due. Outstanding receiptholders and credit-sale contract claimants are not parties to the insolvency action unless admitted by the court upon a motion for intervention.

       Because the supreme court defined a claimant as one who asserted a right to payment for grain sold to a licensee, this included farmers group members even though they sold grain to a company on credit sales payable beyond 30 days, and thus they were claimants entitled to participate in the non-bond assets of a trust fund under N.D.C.C. § 60-02.1-30, and the Public Service Commission was obligated to marshal assets for their benefit under this section; pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 1-02-39(6), the court gave no deference to the Commission’s interpretation of the statutes because the statutes were unambiguous.

        This chapter is wholly inapplicable in those situations where an insolvent grain warehouse chooses the route of liquidation under federal bankruptcy laws. In re Woods Farmers Cooperative Elevator Co., 107 B.R. 678, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 2001 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        This chapter is designed to provide a prompt procedure for claims recovery by a receiptholder through a process of state court appointment of the state public service commission as trustee; its provisions closely parallel the very objective of Chapter 7 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Once a bankruptcy case is filed, the bankruptcy court acquires exclusive jurisdiction over the estate created, and this jurisdiction preempts state solvency proceedings. In re Woods Farmers Cooperative Elevator Co., 107 B.R. 678, 1989 Bankr. LEXIS 2001 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1989).

         Interpretation.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Based upon the North Dakota Supreme Court’s interpretation of N.D.C.C. ch. 60-02 and N.D.C.C. ch. 60-04, to be a “receiptholder” entitled to benefit from the trust fund under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t60c60-04s60-04-03" target="_self">60-04-03.</a></cite>1, transactions with a public warehouseman must at least designate the warehouse for which the public warehouseman is licensed and bonded in the state. The North Dakota Supreme Court rejects a contention that the North Dakota trust fund and the North Dakota bond may benefit anyone who sold grain to a warehouseman, irrespective of the state in which the facility was located; the designated location of the warehouse is crucial, particularly where bond protection is determined by the warehouse for which a receipt is issued.
   PSC v. Minn. Grain, Inc., 2008 ND 184, 756 N.W.2d 763, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of the definition of a credit-sale contract in N.D.C.C. § 60-04-01(2) is part of the statutory framework for insolvency proceedings and explicitly requires a written contract containing the notice required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t60c60-02s60-02-19" target="_self">60-02-19.</a></cite>1(7). The reference in N.D.C.C. § 60-04-01(2) to only one specific subsection of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t60c60-02s60-02-19" target="_self">60-02-19.</a></cite>1 evidences an intent to include only that subsection in the definition of a credit-sale contract for purposes of the priorities in an insolvency proceeding. Moreover, when considered as a whole with N.D.C.C. ch. 60-02, the plain language of N.D.C.C. § 60-02-19.1 is a prohibition against a warehouseman purchasing grain by a credit-sale contract except as provided in that section and not a definition of a credit-sale contract that would replace the definition for an insolvency proceeding in N.D.C.C. § 60-04-01(2).

        The obvious purpose of N.D.C.C. ch. 60-04 is to aid receipt holders in redeeming their warehouse receipts by making the Public Service Commission the trustee of insolvent grain warehousemen with the duty of redeeming said receipts for as close to their full value as possible. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Woods Farmers Coop. Elevator Co., 488 N.W.2d 860, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Plain language in the two clauses of N.D.C.C. § 60-04-02 identifies two circumstances for considering a licensee insolvent: (1) when the licensee has purchased or marketed grain; or (2) when the licensee has stored grained. Under the plain language of § 60-04-02, a licensee is insolvent when the licensee refuses, neglects, or is unable upon proper demand either: (1) to make payment for grain purchased or marketed by the licensee; or (2) to make redelivery or payment for grain stored.

       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Dakota agrees that the most reasonable interpretation of the term marketed in the first clause of N.D.C.C. § 60-04-02 is that it requires the beans to have been sold to a third party. The intent of the first clause is to require the warehouseman to tender payment if the warehouseman purchased the beans for them self or when the beans had been sold to a third party. To interpret marketed as including prospective or current marketing would allow a grower to deliver beans for marketing and, before the beans are sold (marketed), demand payment and trigger insolvency; that result is not reasonable.

        The legislature did not intend that the trust provisions of this section could be defeated by a lender taking a security interest in an insolvent grain warehouseman’s inventory. The purpose of this chapter is to aid receiptholders in redeeming their receipts for as close to their full value as possible. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v.

        Where grain was in good condition when the warehouse filed its bankruptcy petition, and deterioration of the grain took place while it was in the custody of the bankruptcy trustee, the surety was not liable for any loss suffered by a creditor as a result of deterioration in the quality of the grain while it was in the custody and control of the bankruptcy trustee; under N.D.C.C. § 60-02-09 and this section the warehouse’s surety was required to insure only the warehouse’s faithful performance of its duties as a public warehouseman, and was not required to insure the faithful performance of the bankruptcy trustee’s duties. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Jamestown Farmers Elevator, 422 N.W.2d 405, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 107</cite> (N.D. 1988).

         Ownership Interest.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a party purchases grain from a warehouseman without taking delivery and receives warehouse receipts as evidence of the sale, the warehouse receipts are valid claims against an insolvent warehouseman, even though the receipt holder did not actually deliver grain to the warehouse in return for the receipts. However, this does not alter the fundamental principle that the party to whom the warehouse receipt is issued must have an ownership interest in the grain described on the warehouse receipt. An ownership interest is not synonymous with a security interest. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Valley Farmers Bean Ass'n, 365 N.W.2d 528, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 285</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the warehouse receipts issued to the banks specifically state that they were issued as “collateral” or “security” for a line of credit, the warehouse receipts were given as collateral for a loan, the banks did not assert that they delivered grain to the warehouse in exchange for the receipts, that they paid for the beans reflected on the receipts, or that they paid fees for the storage of the beans, and the warehouse receipts submitted by the banks in support of their claim were only intended to serve as security for the loan to the public warehouseman, the banks’ receipts were invalid because they did not have an ownership interest in the beans. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Valley Farmers Bean Ass'n, 365 N.W.2d 528, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 285</cite> (N.D. 1985).

         Purpose of Bonds.

       <p>
        The overriding purpose of requiring warehouseman’s bonds is to protect all persons who sell or deliver grain to a warehouseman. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Central States Grain, 371 N.W.2d 767, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 365</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       </p>
       <p>
        The trust fund exists for the benefit of all unpaid sellers of grain, regardless of whether they hold cash slips or checks, and the surety’s liability under a warehouseman’s bond extends to those unpaid sellers unless the unpaid seller had knowingly entered into a deferred payment contract or other credit arrangement within the meaning of N.D.C.C. § 60-02-09(7). North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Central States Grain, 371 N.W.2d 767, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 365</cite> (N.D. 1985).

         Trust Fund.

       </p>
       <p>
        The trust fund consists of not only the type and quality of grain represented by claims filed by producers, but all of the grain remaining in the warehouse at the time of insolvency. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Valley Farmers Bean Ass'n, 365 N.W.2d 528, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 285</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the insolvency of a grain warehouseman, a trust fund consisting of all the grain in said warehouse is established for the redemption of outstanding receipts. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n v. Valley Farmers Bean Ass'n, 365 N.W.2d 528, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 285</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the purpose of the trust fund is to insure that farmers storing or selling grain in an insolvent warehouse receive payment for that grain to the fullest extent possible, assets of the insolvent warehouseman should be considered “grain” includable in the trust fund whenever reasonable.

        Based upon the North Dakota Supreme Court’s interpretation of N.D.C.C. ch. 60-02 and N.D.C.C. ch. 60-04, to be a “receiptholder” entitled to benefit from the trust fund under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t60c60-04s60-04-03" target="_self">60-04-03.</a></cite>1, transactions with a public warehouseman must at least designate the warehouse for which the public warehouseman is licensed and bonded in the state. The North Dakota Supreme Court rejects a contention that the North Dakota trust fund and the North Dakota bond may benefit anyone who sold grain to a warehouseman, irrespective of the state in which the facility was located; the designated location of the warehouse is crucial, particularly where bond protection is determined by the warehouse for which a receipt is issued.

       <p>
        Under statutes governing grain warehouses, grain receipt holders are entitled to be made whole, if possible, when a warehouseman becomes insolvent. A warehouseman is required to furnish a bond to provide that protection to producers who deliver grain for sale or storage, and the surety is liable under the bond to the extent necessary to make the receipt holders whole after deducting what they have received from the bankruptcy trustee.

        If surety believed it was entitled to a credit for the amount of grain proceeds not distributed to grain claimants, or was not to be held responsible for paying the bankruptcy trustee’s costs and expenses because they should not have been withheld from the grain proceeds, or was entitled to the deduction of offsets, its remedy was not to leave receipt holders unpaid, but to seek relief in the bankruptcy proceedings once it paid the claims of receipt holders.

If it appears in the best interests of the receiptholders, the court may order the surety to deposit the penal sum of the bond, or so much of the sum as may be deemed necessary, into the trustee’s trust account pending a final determination of the surety’s liability under the bond.

      Upon the commissioner’s appointment by the district court, the commissioner may take possession of relevant books and records of the warehouseman. The commissioner shall cause a notice of the commissioner’s appointment to be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper in the county in which the warehouse is located and may notify by ordinary mail the holders of record of outstanding receipts and those who are potential credit-sale contract claimants, as shown by the warehouseman’s records. The notices must require outstanding receiptholders and credit-sale contract claimants to file their claims against the warehouseman with the commissioner along with the receipts, contracts, or any other evidence of the claims as required by the commissioner. If an outstanding receiptholder or credit-sale contract claimant fails to submit a claim within forty-five days after the last publication of the notice or a longer time as prescribed by the commissioner, the commissioner is relieved of further duty or action under this chapter on behalf of the receiptholder or credit-sale contract claimant and the receiptholder or credit-sale contract claimant may be barred from payment for any amount due. Outstanding receiptholders and credit-sale contract claimants are not parties to the insolvency action unless admitted by the court upon a motion for intervention.

        Claimant who was not an unknown receiptholder, but was listed by the public service commission as a claimant from the beginning of the proceedings after its examination of warehouseman’s books and records, and the existence of whose claim was stipulated and therefore acknowledged by surety and the commission, was properly allowed to file his claim at the hearing, despite contention that he had not filed within the ninety day period under this section.

     <p>
      A receiptholder does not have a separate claim for relief upon the warehouseman’s bond, nor for insurance, nor against any person converting grain, nor against any other receiptholder, except through the trustee, unless, upon demand of five or more receiptholders, the commissioner fails or refuses to apply for the commissioner’s own appointment from the district court or unless the district court denies the application for appointment. This chapter does not prohibit or prevent any receiptholder, either individually or in conjunction with other receiptholders, from pursuing concurrently such other remedy against the person or property of the warehouseman, for the whole, or any deficiency occurring in the redemption, of the receipts.

      Every railroad company or corporation organized under the laws of this state or doing business in this state, upon application in writing, shall provide reasonable sidetrack facilities and running connections between its main track and elevators and warehouses upon or contiguous to its right of way at such stations. Every such railroad corporation shall permit connections to be made and maintained in a reasonable manner with its sidetracks to and from any warehouse or elevator without reference to its size, cost, or capacity, if grain or potatoes are or may be stored. The railroad company is not required to construct or furnish any sidetracks except upon its own land or right of way. Such elevators and warehouses may not be constructed within one hundred feet [30.48 meters] of any existing structure and must be at safe fire distance from the station buildings so as not to conflict essentially with the safe and convenient operation of the road. If stations are ten miles [16.09 kilometers] or more apart the railroad company, if required so to do by the commissioner, shall construct and maintain a sidetrack for the use of shippers between such stations.

    Subrogation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Money paid from the credit-sale contract indemnity fund in satisfaction of a valid claim constitutes a debt obligation of the person against whom the claim was made. The commissioner may take action on behalf of the fund against a person to recover the amount of payment made, plus costs and attorney’s fees. Any recovery for reimbursement to the fund must include interest computed at the weight average prime rate charged by the Bank of North Dakota. Upon payment of a claim from the credit-sale contract indemnity fund, the claimant shall subrogate the interest of the claimant, if any, to the commissioner in a cause of action against all parties, to the amount of the loss that the claimant was reimbursed by the fund.
