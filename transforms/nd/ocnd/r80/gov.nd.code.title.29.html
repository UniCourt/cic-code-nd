        Generally, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are most effectively presented in proceedings for post-conviction relief pursuant to chapter 29-32.1. However, when defective assistance of counsel is urged on direct appeal, supreme court will review the entire record, and if it cannot readily determine that assistance of counsel was plainly defective and there exist no other grounds for reversal, then defendant can later pursue his claim at a post-conviction proceeding where an adequate record can be developed. State v. Sayler, 443 N.W.2d 915, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        If witness is necessary to proper presentation of defendant’s case, defendant should see that witness is called; failure of state to call witness whose name was endorsed on amended information was not error since defense could have subpoenaed that witness. State v. Henderson, 156 N.W.2d 700, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1968).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A hearing on a motion to suppress evidence is a critical stage of the prosecution and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees an accused the right to confront witnesses against him at such hearing. State v. Mondo, 325 N.W.2d 201, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 343</cite> (N.D. 1982), overruled in part, State v. Woinarowicz, 2006 ND 179, 720 N.W.2d 635, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although responses given by nine-year-old victim of sexual offense did not specifically answer the questions asked by the defendant, those responses did not constitute a denial of the defendant’s right to confront the witness; rather, those responses raised a credibility issue to be resolved by the trier of fact. State v. Jenkins, 326 N.W.2d 67, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 331</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion of the forensic analyst’s testimony based on defendant’s acquiescence to admission of the chemical test results was contrary to N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07 and the refusal to allow the analyst to testify was unreasonable and warranted a new trial.
   While defendant admitted to drinking and smelled of alcohol, there was little evidence indicating that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor and thus, exclusion of the testimony was not harmless.
   State v. Schwab, 2008 ND 94, 748 N.W.2d 696, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 2008).

        Defendant was denied his right to a jury trial where he was tried by court and record did not reveal that defendant expressly and intelligently consented to waiver of his right to a jury trial; when a written waiver is not submitted, a trial court could eliminate doubt and safeguard rights of a defendant by obtaining an express statement of defendant specifically indicating on record that a jury trial is or is not waived.

        The right of criminal defendant to a trial in the county of the alleged offense, as stated in subsection 5, is subject to the mandatory change of venue on the filing of an affidavit of prejudice against a county justice.

        Where defendant appeared in district court and stated that he knew he was entitled to counsel, that he did not want to be represented, that he desired to plead guilty, and there was no showing that he was influenced by any threats or promises, he was not deprived of his right to counsel. State ex rel. Johnson v. Broderick, 75 N.D. 340, 27 N.W.2d 849, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1947).

        The defendant’s written request that the court either move his trial date forward to accommodate his attorney’s absence, appoint another attorney, or allow him to represent himself was actually a request for hybrid representation, or the ability to participate as co-counsel with his attorney. State v. Ochoa, 2004 ND 43, 675 N.W.2d 161, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 2004).

       <p>
        The defendant’s written request that the court either move his trial date forward to accommodate his attorney’s absence, appoint another attorney, or allow him to represent himself was not an unequivocal waiver of his right to counsel and the trial court did not commit error in denying his right to self-representation as any ambiguity had to be resolved against waiver. State v. Ochoa, 2004 ND 43, 675 N.W.2d 161, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        Where state filed warrant of arrest as detainer against accused imprisoned in neighboring state prison and made reasonable efforts in good faith to extradite him for trial, accused’s petition to withdraw the detainer because he had not been granted speedy trial was dismissed, since delay was caused by inaction of neighboring state officials and not bad faith or lack of diligence by North Dakota officials. Morris v. McGee, 180 N.W.2d 659, 1970 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 1970).

        A plea of guilty constitutes a waiver of the right to a speedy trial. State v. Wunderlich, 338 N.W.2d 658, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 351</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusory allegations of an impaired defense from a delayed trial do not prove prejudice. State v. Murchison, 541 N.W.2d 435, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 233</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Actual prejudice to defendant from delay was not apparent where he was in jail for separate convictions much of the time before his trial; almost seven months of his incarceration was unrelated to the case at bar, and “oppressive pretrial incarceration” did not occur. State v. Murchison, 541 N.W.2d 435, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 233</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial where his attempts to invoke Interstate Agreement on Detainers did not constitute a proper request for a speedy trial, much of the delay was attributable to motions filed by the defendant, and the defendant did not demonstrate that his ability to defend against charges was impaired by the delay. State v. Moe, 1998 ND 137, 581 N.W.2d 468, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated where he failed to inform the district court of his change of address when he was transported from another county, failed to object when hearings were rescheduled, failed to request immediate disposition of the charges during his preliminary hearings, and failed to follow the procedural requirements of the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 29-33. State v. Johnson, 1999 ND 33, 590 N.W.2d 192, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied his right to speedy trial where, although eight months passed between the date of defendant’s arrest and the commencement of his trial, considering the appointments of counsel and various intervening motions that were filed, defendant’s actions reasonably attributed to the delay and there was no actual prejudice to him by the delay. State v. Ochoa, 2004 ND 43, 675 N.W.2d 161, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the defendant’s trial was delayed for about two years, there was no evidence that the State purposefully delayed the trial, and defendant moved to suppress evidence from the searches about 400 days after pre-trial motions were due; defendant did not satisfy the appellate court that his speedy trial rights were violated by the delay in bringing his case to trial. State v. Bergstrom, 2004 ND 48, 676 N.W.2d 83, 676 N.W.2d 98, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fifteen-month delay between defendant’s arrest and his trial did not violate his right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and N.D.C.C. § 29-01-06(5) because the primary reason for the delay was defendant’s dissatisfaction with his attorneys, which resulted in multiple changes of court-appointed counsel and delays. Defendant also sought multiple continuances.
   State v. Fischer, 2008 ND 32, 744 N.W.2d 760, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant had a right to a speedy trial and was presumed innocent, his continued pretrial detention at the State Hospital had to be determined under the statutory procedures and safeguards of N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.1. State v. Holbach, 2014 ND 14, 842 N.W.2d 328, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 984, 135 S. Ct. 462, 190 L. Ed. 2d 347, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 7253 (U.S. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not deprived of his speedy trial rights under the United States or North Dakota Constitutions because the reason for the delay was precipitated by defendant's act of effectively firing his first counsel; the extent of the delay involved reasonable scheduling considerations for an anticipated five-day jury trial and the designation of a second court-appointed counsel. State v. Owens, 2015 ND 68, 860 N.W.2d 817, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated because the eight month delay did not trigger the presumption of prejudice, the reason for delay was the unavailability of a witness, and the district court found there to be no evidence of bad faith on the part of the State in the underlying motion to dismiss without prejudice. State v. Abdiwali Mohamud, 2019 ND 101, 925 N.W.2d 396, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Double jeopardy barred further prosecution of defendant on a gross sexual imposition charge because jeopardy had attached when the jury was empaneled and sworn and then was discharged from the case by the trial court on its own motion. Discharging the jury was not manifestly necessary even though it was done for the benefit of defendant, who had requested that an attorney be appointed to represent him.

        Juvenile’s double jeopardy rights, U.S. Const. amend. V, N.D. Const. art. I, § 12, N.D.C.C. § 29-01-07, were not violated by the juvenile court’s adjudication of delinquency premised on evidence of same conduct which formed the basis of the sanction imposed by the juvenile drug court.

        Where a civil forfeiture proceeding against defendant’s automobile was dismissed because it had not been instituted promptly, and there was no final administrative or judicial action against the property, even if the civil forfeiture proceeding was characterized as punitive rather than remedial, jeopardy did not attach to this civil forfeiture proceeding because it was dismissed before final action was taken against the property.

       <p>
        Double jeopardy did not bar defendant’s second jury trial where first jury failed to reach a unanimous decision and a mistrial was declared after two and a half hours of deliberation; fact that prosecution learned of a particular item of evidence that had confused the jury at the first trial and sought to address the deficiency in the evidence at the second trial did not mandate double jeopardy bar as this was not the type of benefit to the State that would implicate the double jeopardy clause and, although the time of the deliberations was short, given the depth of the jury’s division and the resultant threat it posed to an impartial verdict, the trial judge acted within the confines of his discretion, manifest necessity, and the ends of public justice in declaring a mistrial.
   State v. Linghor, 2004 ND 224, 690 N.W.2d 201, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 364</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s retrial was not barred by double jeopardy because her motion for mistrial precluded double jeopardy from applying; defendant had not established the city’s conduct in asking a general question of a police officer goaded or provoked her into moving for the mistrial because the police officer was the city’s first witness early in the trial, and it had no reason to provoke a mistrial at that early stage. City of W. Fargo v. Le Ekstrom, 2020 ND 37, 938 N.W.2d 915, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite>5 (N.D. 2020); 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (February 12, 2020).
       </p>

        Double jeopardy did not bar retrial following defendant’s first and second trials because the jury’s guilty verdict in the first trial was set aside at defendant’s insistence after the discovery of juror misconduct, and thus, the State was entitled to retry the case; double jeopardy did not prohibit a retrial of defendant following the second trial because the district court granted his motion for mistrial after the jury communicated it could not reach a unanimous verdict.

        Under the United States Constitution and under the North Dakota Constitution, a criminal prosecution for DUI does not constitute double jeopardy even though the defendant’s driver’s license previously had been suspended in an administrative hearing for the same DUI offense.

       A criminal complaint issued by the county court of increased jurisdiction, meeting the requirements of N.D.C.C. § 29-05-01, and charging the defendant with drunken driving, was sufficient as an information to give the court jurisdiction. State v. Buehler, 125 N.W.2d 155, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Information used to charge defendant with an ordinance violation was in sufficient form and advised defendant of the ordinance violated, and, thus, met the requirements of N.D.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(1) for making a defendant aware of the nature of the offense that defendant committed. Since that criminal procedural rule applied to determine the sufficiency of the charging instrument filed against the defendant, criminal procedural statutes such as N.D.C.C. § 11-09.1-13 and N.D.C.C. § 29-01-13 that conflicted with the criminal procedural rule did not apply.

        In a prosecution for gambling, where the defendant’s statement indicated that, while he was working in Beulah (which is in Mercer County), he placed and accepted bets and passed the proceeds on to a man known as “Chief,” and a witness who personally engaged in gambling transactions with the defendant testified that he obtained line sheets from the defendant which he then used to solicit wagers from coworkers in Oliver County, and he later turned the bets over to the defendant, who paid him for his services, the defendant’s written statement that he met “Chief” while working in Beulah and that he placed wagers for others which he then turned over to “Chief” supported a reasonable inference that part of the gambling transactions took place in Beulah. Therefore, venue in Mercer County was proper. State v. Rasmussen, 365 N.W.2d 481, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 280</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Defendant contended that the three-year statute of limitations barred his conviction on seven of the nine counts alleged in the information, because the transactions involved in those counts were alleged to have occurred more than three years before the informations were filed. Relying on an amendment to this section, the State responded that the prosecutions for those seven counts were within the three-year statute of limitations. The 1987 amendment to this section was applicable to the case, since statutes enacted by the legislature are to be applied prospectively, the conduct in the case occurred before the 1987 amendment to this section, and the legislature did not clearly express retroactive application of that amendment.

       <p>
        Charges based on the sexual abuse of defendant’s young nephew were not barred by the statute of limitations; because the nephew was under 15 at the time of the offense, the statute of limitations did not begin to run until his 15th birthday in 1997, he did not report the offense to law enforcement until January 31, 2005, therefore, the prosecution had to be commenced within three years after that date, and the State filed a criminal complaint against defendant in June 2005, well within the three-year limitation period.

The offense was reported to law enforcement authorities in December 2002, within the initial seven-year limitation period, and the prosecution was commenced within seven years.

        Defendant was properly convicted of gross sexual imposition against a her son and stepson because the district court did not err in sentencing her in excess of the recommendations where defendant waived her factual argument by pleading guilty, the jury was properly instructed on the statute of limitations, the district court could consider the testimony at the earlier hearings regarding the date the offense was reported, defendant did not move withdraw her guilty plea, and the parties were aware the recommendation of sentence was nonbinding.

        The right to consult with an attorney before taking a chemical test is not derived from the state or federal constitutions, but from this section. State v. Sadek, 552 N.W.2d 71, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Finding by the state transportation agency’s hearing officer, that the motorist was offered a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney, as required by N.D.C.C. § 29-05-20, after the motorist had been stopped for suspected DUI and refused to take a requested chemical test, was supported by the record, as required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_blank">28-32-46.</a></cite> Since the record showed that the motorist had remarked that it was too late at night to contact an attorney, the revocation of the motorist’s driving privileges had to be upheld.

        Revocation of the petitioner’s driving privileges was proper, because the petitioner had a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney, when the petitioner waited over ten minutes before making a call, and rather than calling an attorney the petitioner called a friend; based on the testimony regarding the petitioner’s continued attempts to change the focus of the investigation, his refusal to follow instructions and his complaints about being uncomfortable in the officer’s patrol vehicle, a reasonable mind could have determined the petitioner was trying to delay the investigation.
   Bell v. N.D. DOT, 2012 ND 102, 816 N.W.2d 786, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Revocation of a driving under the influence of alcohol arrestee's driving privileges was proper because a preponderance of the evidence supported the hearing officer's factual finding that the arrestee did not request to speak with an attorney before submitting to a chemical test; the arrestee's reference to “lawyer up,” which was mixed in with a barrage of profanity launched at the deputy was beyond the bright line standard against which a purported request for an attorney were judged. Cudmore v. Dir. of the N.D. DOT, 2016 ND 64, 877 N.W.2d 52, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        Because a driver made no attempt to call a lawyer, the supreme court did not have to decide whether the right to counsel would be violated by placing a person in a recorded and monitored room while the person speaks with a lawyer. Koehly v. Levi, 2016 ND 202, 886 N.W.2d 689, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 207</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence was appropriate because defendant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to consult with an attorney. Defendant was placed in the only room in a police station known by an officer to have a working telephone, defendant was provided with a phone book, the officer kept defendant in view from the time defendant was arrested until the chemical test was conducted, the officer refused to close the door to ensure defendant placed nothing in defendant's mouth prior to administration of the test. City of Dickinson v. Schank, 2017 ND 81, 892 N.W.2d 593, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        Police officer did not violate defendant's limited statutory right to counsel by denying his request to speak with an attorney in between the first and second “blows” of the second breath test sequence.

        District court properly entered a judgment against defendant following his conditional guilty plea to the charge of driving under the influence because he was provided with an opportunity to consult with an attorney before he decided whether to submit to chemical testing and was not required to be provided with a second chance to consult with an attorney subsequent to making a decision to take the chemical test.

        Where defendant was not given access to a telephone to attempt to seek advice and assistance, and defendant’s relatively unimpaired condition permitted an inference that contact with others would have resulted in evidence helpful to his defense, the trial court’s finding that defendant was actually prejudiced by his detention was supported by sufficient competent evidence.

        In an arrest for drunk driving, where a call to the family would be a local call without any charge for long distance, there is no reason why the police should prevent a call to the driver’s family for information to locate the family’s lawyer, so long as the time for phone calls, the testing, and the booking process is not unduly extended; the jail has no duty to underwrite long-distance calls by arrested drivers before a chemical test decision is made, even though it should not interfere with a driver’s efforts to locate a lawyer so long as the arrest procedure is not unduly delayed.

     <p>
      While having in charge any person arrested in a criminal action or proceeding, neither the officer, nor any of the officer’s assistants, is liable to arrest on civil process, and such officer is authorized to require any citizen to aid in securing the accused and to retake the accused, if the accused escapes, in any part of the state, as if the officer were within the officer’s own county. A refusal or neglect to render such aid is an offense in the same manner as if the arresting officer were an officer of the county where such aid is required.

      Whenever a warrant for the arrest of a person accused of a crime or public offense is issued by a magistrate, the delivery of the warrant by telegraph may be authorized by a judge of the supreme or district court by an endorsement authorizing telegraphic delivery, at any place within this state, upon the warrant of arrest under the hand of the judge, directed generally to any peace officer in the state. After endorsement, a copy of the warrant may be sent by telegraph to any peace officer within the state, and the copy is as effectual in the hands of any peace officer, who shall serve the same and in all regards proceed thereunder, as though the peace officer held an original warrant issued by the magistrate making the endorsement thereon.

Any telegraphic copy of a warrant under which an officer has acted in making an arrest must be deemed the original warrant.

        Complaint authorized by this section was sufficient notwithstanding fact that it did not carry signature of an officer entitled to administer the oath to the complainant and failed to identify the county where the alleged drunken driving occurred, since the docket entry indicated that the county judge swore the complainant but failed to sign the complaint and judicial notice was taken of fact that town mentioned in complaint was in county where case was heard.

        If the defendant feels the complaint provided for under this section does not set forth facts with sufficient clarity to inform him of the offense with which he is charged, he may move to quash. But where defendant fails to move to quash before entering his plea, he waives all objections he might have made to the complaint except those which are also grounds for a motion in arrest of judgment by operation of former N.D.C.C. § 29-14-12 (see now N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 12).

        Entry of Residence.

      </p>
      <p>
       North Dakota Supreme Court agrees with other courts that a warrant supported by probable cause, regardless of whether it is a felony or misdemeanor warrant, provides a law officer authority to enter the residence of the person named in the warrant in order to execute the warrant. Therefore, a motion to suppress was improperly granted based on the entry into a residence to serve a misdemeanor warrant; consent was not required for entry. State v.

        Objective Test.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable person in defendant’s situation would have concluded he was under arrest when he was removed from the automobile by police; a reasonable person, found in an automobile smelling of anhydrous ammonia with an abundance of drug paraphernalia in plain sight, would not feel free to exit the car, much less leave the crime scene and this fact was reinforced by the presence of three officers on the scene, two of whom were exclusively focused on defendant as he was removed from the vehicle.
   State v. Linghor, 2004 ND 224, 690 N.W.2d 201, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 364</cite> (N.D. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts objectively examine the totality of the circumstances to determine whether an arrest occurred; the proper, objective test asks whether circumstances existed that would have caused a reasonable person to conclude he was under arrest and not free to leave.
   State v. Linghor, 2004 ND 224, 690 N.W.2d 201, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 364</cite> (N.D. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a police officer never told defendant that she was under arrest, when the officer handcuffed defendant after finding what was believed to be methamphetamine, a reasonable person would have assumed that defendant was under arrest; the search of defendant’s purse and her person was incident to that arrest.

        In a case in which defendant appealed from a district court's criminal judgment and order denying his motion to suppress, the Supreme Court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to reach probable cause to arrest for the offense of actual physical control occurring at the time defendant's vehicle crashed into an electrical box. Sufficient evidence of intoxication also existed. City of Bismarck v. Weisz, 2018 ND 49, 907 N.W.2d 409, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       <p>
        The term “charge”, within the statute authorizing an arrest without a warrant on a charge, made on reasonable cause, of the commission of a felony, does not mean a formal written charge presented to the proper authority, but includes an oral charge or accusation made to a peace officer. Haggard v. First Nat'l Bank, 72 N.D. 434, 8 N.W.2d 5, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1943).

        A “charge” within the terms of a statute authorizing arrest without warrant on a charge, made on reasonable cause, of the commission of a felony, does not mean “a formal written charge presented to proper authority” but includes an oral charge or accusation made to a peace officer. State v. Willms, 117 N.W.2d 84, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The arrest on an oral charge of an owner of a place of business which had accepted a check drawn on a bank in which the defendant had no account, was proper since such arrest was made on a charge, based upon reasonable cause, of the commission of a felony by the defendant. State v. Willms, 117 N.W.2d 84, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1962).

        Subsection 6 of this section (now subdivision (1)(f)) was specific and was enacted later than former N.D.C.C. § 29-06-16 (now N.D.C.C. § 29-06-08), so that it controlled and allowed officer to make night arrest without warrant for driving under the influence, even though conditions of such former section were not met. City of Minot v. Knudson, 184 N.W.2d 58, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to subsection 6 of this section (now subdivision (1)(f)), reasonable cause for arrest was established where petitioner’s speech was slurred, he walked unsteadily, he had trouble responding to officer’s questions, his eyes were glazed and bloodshot, and he had a strong odor of alcohol about him. Smestad v. Ellingson, 191 N.W.2d 799, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant’s vehicle changed lanes and speed several times without apparent reason, defendant had difficulty producing driver’s license and fell against arresting officer who smelled alcohol on defendant’s breath, officer had sufficient grounds to arrest defendant, without a warrant, for driving under the influence. Clairmont v. Hjelle, 234 N.W.2d 13, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 1975).

        Subdivision (1)(f) of this section permits probable cause warrantless arrests for D.U.I., but does not expressly condone such arrests in the home. Patzner v. Burkett, 779 F.2d 1363, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 25801 (8th Cir. N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Facts supported the police officer’s probable cause determination where an off-duty deputy sheriff reported a suspicious vehicle being driven in the dark without the use of headlights; the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer’s knowledge were sufficient to lead a person of reasonable caution to believe an offense had been committed where the arresting officer observed driver’s vehicle parked in the middle of the alley with the driver lying in the seat with a strong odor of alcohol pervading the vehicle. Obrigewitch v. Dir., N.D. DOT, 2002 ND 177, 653 N.W.2d 73, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        Where an arrest is based on commission of an offense in the presence of the arresting officer, subsequent acquittal invalidates the arrest and removes the basis for revocation of a vehicle operator’s license under N.D.C.C., ch. 39-20. Colling v. Hjelle, 125 N.W.2d 453 (N.D. 1963), decided prior to the amendment of N.D.C.C. § 29-06-15(1).

        Police officer trained in detection of marijuana from its burning odor had reasonable cause to believe that person arrested had committed a public offense where he smelled burning marijuana from open window of automobile, and subsequent warrantless search and seizure of marijuana in automobile was justified. State v. Binns, 194 N.W.2d 756, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Odor of marijuana emanating from vehicle stopped for traffic violation gave police officer who was trained in narcotics identification probable cause to make an arrest, and the search of the driver immediately preceding the arrest was a valid search incident to the arrest. State v. Overby, 1999 ND 47, 590 N.W.2d 703, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1999), overruled in part, State v. K.V.

       <p>
        Defendants, who were 20 years old, were properly arrested for underage drinking where police were in the open doorway of an apartment, did not enter, but questioned the defendants who admitted to being under age and consuming alcohol. City of Fargo v. Steffan, 2002 ND 26, 639 N.W.2d 482, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Police had probable cause to arrest defendant at the time of the pocket search and, when viewed objectively, had placed him under arrest by the time of the search; the search was therefore justified as a search performed incident to the arrest. Upon seeing the methamphetamine paraphernalia in plain view in the automobile, the officers had probable cause to believe that some drug-related crime was either committed or attempted; therefore, police had the authority to arrest the responsible parties without a warrant, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence.
   State v. Linghor, 2004 ND 224, 690 N.W.2d 201, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 364</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of preventing arrest or discharge of other duties where defendant created a substantial risk of bodily injury to the sheriff and “substantial force” was required to overcome defendant’s resistance to effecting the arrest and the sheriff was acting lawfully under N.D.C.C. § 29-06-15 when he arrested defendant, as the defendant was committing disorderly conduct in the sheriff’s presence. Defendant swung at the sheriff one or two times and when the sheriff told defendant he was placing him under arrest, defendant put up both fists and swung and grazed the side of the sheriff’s face, and, after defendant was wrestled to the ground, he was trying to kick the sheriff.
   State v. Barth, 2005 ND 134, 702 N.W.2d 1, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 2005).

        Where defendant provided no transcript on appeal, as required by N.D.R.App.P., Rule 10(b), from convictions for preventing arrest and related offenses, the appellate court had no basis to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence and, in response to defendant’s argument that his arrest was not a lawful warrantless arrest under N.D.C.C. §
   29-06-15, had to infer that defendant failed to provide evidence supporting the defense of unlawful police conduct under N.D.C.C. §

        An arrest without a warrant is valid when a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the arrested person committed a felony. State v. Indvik, 382 N.W.2d 623, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable cause to support a warrantless arrest exists when the facts and circumstances within a police officer’s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that an offense has been or is being committed. State v. Indvik, 382 N.W.2d 623, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        To establish probable cause, it is not necessary that the officer possess knowledge of facts sufficient to establish guilt; all that is necessary is knowledge that would furnish a prudent person with reasonable grounds for believing a violation has occurred. State v. Hensel, 417 N.W.2d 849, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        Where police officer was told by a resident that someone was sleeping in a parked car with the engine running, and upon investigation the officer found defendant asleep in his car, smelling of alcohol, confused and with bloodshot eyes, surrounded by beer cans, one open, the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant, since the officer could reasonably conclude that defendant was in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol under subdivision 1 f. State v. Hensel, 417 N.W.2d 849, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        Police officers could reasonably have believed there was probable cause to arrest plaintiff for trespassing and were immune from claim under 42 USCS § 1983, where they advised plaintiff he was not privileged to be in university student lounge and gave him notice he was trespassing. Wishnatsky v. Bergquist, 550 N.W.2d 394, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 895, 117 S. Ct. 240, 136 L. Ed. 2d 169, 1996 U.S. LEXIS 5876 (U.S. 1996).

        Location of the ignition key was an issue that arose after the arrest of motorist for suspected driving while under the influence of alcohol, and probable cause for arrest must be based on what was known at the time of the arrest; because probable cause to arrest existed without establishing the location of the key, the motorist was properly arrested. Obrigewitch v. Dir., N.D. DOT, 2002 ND 177, 653 N.W.2d 73, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        The police officer was authorized under this section to make a warrantless arrest of the defendant, who had lost consciousness at a restaurant drive-up window behind the wheel of his running motor vehicle, walked unsteadily and failed field sobriety tests; the officer had probable cause to believe the defendant was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or another substance. State v. Waltz, 2003 ND 197, 672 N.W.2d 457, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        Denial of suppression motion was affirmed because officers had probable cause to arrest an individual lying in the back seat of a vehicle for physical obstruction of government function, preventing arrest and burglary, where, during the investigation of a burglary the officers observed defendant and his companion in the vehicle and observed gloves, a hammer and a crowbar, and the occupants refused to open the vehicle and the officers had a locksmith open the vehicle. The officers’ use of a locksmith to open the vehicle to effectuate the arrest of the occupants was eminently reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, seizure of the evidence would have been justified under the plain view doctrine or as incident to a lawful arrest, and the officers’ use of caution in obtaining a search warrant before proceeding further and their subjective beliefs as to the existence or nonexistence of reasonable suspicion and probable cause were of no moment. State v. Washington, 2007 ND 138, 737 N.W.2d 382, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 2007).

        Police officer had the required N.D.C.C. § 29-06-15 probable cause, also known as “reasonable suspicion,” to investigate a report of the motorist being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and, thus, the officer did not violate the motorist’s rights under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, when the officer made a warrantless arrest of the motorist. The officer observed that the motorist had bloodshot eyes, slow speech, mush mouth, and heard the motorist admit that the motorist had been drinking.

        No warrant for arrest on charge of being intoxicated in public place was necessary where public offense was committed in arresting officer’s presence; in prosecution for resisting arrest arising out of officer’s attempts to arrest accused for public intoxication, it was unnecessary to determine legality of complaint charging him with public intoxication since that offense was public offense, officers had reasonable grounds to believe that offense was being committed by accused in their presence, and resistance to arrest was with force and violence.

        Where robbery was committed, police found defendant jogging north of the robbery location shortly afterwards, defendant was nervous and frightened, his answers to questions were irrational, and there were large bulges plainly visible in his pockets which he stated contained money, the totality of the circumstances gave the officers reasonable cause to believe defendant had committed the robbery.

        Police officer had reasonable cause to believe that a felony had been committed by the defendant, and had authority to make a warrantless arrest of defendant for a felony not committed in officer’s presence, where police officer had reasonable cause to believe that defendant was in possession of a stolen credit card in violation of section 12.1-23-02 and that the street value or thieves’ market value of the credit card was of an amount to classify the illegal possession as a class C felony.

       <p>
        A combination of probable cause and exigent circumstances is required to permit the warrantless, nonconsensual entry into a suspect’s home to make a felony arrest; the imminent destruction of evidence of a crime may be a sufficient exigent circumstance to permit the warrantless, nonconsensual entry into a home to make an arrest; however, when destruction of evidence is the exigent circumstance, there must be more than a mere belief that such destruction is probable, coupled with the fact that the suspects know or will soon become aware that the police are on their trail, and that the entry is the least intrusive which, under the circumstances, is possible. State v. Nagel, 308 N.W.2d 539, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 318</cite> (N.D. 1981).

       <p>
        Officers’ testimony about the feared destruction of evidence, upon which they based their right to enter the home without a warrant, was nothing more than speculation and did not demonstrate exigent circumstances so as to overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries.

        Where private person saw defendant driving a car and was within minutes thereafter informed by a peace officer that defendant’s driver’s license was suspended, private person’s sensory perception alerted her to the fact defendant was driving with a suspended license, and such offense was committed in the presence of the private person.

       <p>
        In order to have a valid citizen’s arrest for a public offense committed in the citizen’s presence, the public offense must have been committed or attempted in the presence of the private person; with the phrase “in his presence” being liberally construed and “presence” determined by whether or not the private person detected commission of the offense through use of his senses.

         Delay in Presenting Prisoner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        What amounts to reasonable diligence in presenting a prisoner before a magistrate depends on the peculiar facts of each case. Haggard v. First Nat'l Bank, 72 N.D. 434, 8 N.W.2d 5, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere delay in taking a defendant arrested without a warrant before a magistrate will not render a confession made in the meantime inadmissible. State v. Nagel, 75 N.D. 495, 28 N.W.2d 665, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of a person arrested without a warrant to be taken before the nearest and most accessible magistrate of the county where he was arrested is not a constitutional right but purely statutory, and where the record establishes that the person was lawfully arrested and taken to the adjacent county, where the offense for which he was arrested was triable, and the following morning was taken before a magistrate who set bail, he is not, after conviction of the offense for which he was arrested, entitled to post-conviction relief on ground that statute was not complied with. State v. Rudolph, 193 N.W.2d 237, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Three-day delay in taking defendant before a magistrate, although a questionable practice, was not unreasonable since defendant was asked at preliminary hearing whether he had made any confessions or admissions or whether he had been threatened by anyone and he replied in the negative, and since there was no evidence of interrogation or the eliciting of damaging statements. State v. Barlow, 193 N.W.2d 455, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1971).

        Where Indian was arrested on reservation without warrant by deputy sheriff of adjacent county for felony committed in that county and no contention was made that felony was not committed or that officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe that the Indian had committed it, arrest did not deprive Indian of rights under constitution or laws or treaties of United States, and thus he was not entitled to habeas corpus; failure to take Indian before nearest magistrate in county where arrest was made, instead of taking him before magistrate of county in which offense was triable, was not prejudicial and did not entitle Indian to habeas corpus.

       Lawyers provided to represent indigent persons must be compensated at a reasonable rate to be determined by the commission on legal counsel for indigents. Expenses necessary for the adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted in district court, other than for a violation of a home rule county’s ordinance, when approved by the commission, must be paid by the state. Expenses necessary for the adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted for violation of a home rule county’s ordinance must be paid by the home rule county. Expenses necessary for the adequate defense of an indigent person prosecuted in municipal court, when approved by the judge, must be paid by the city in which the alleged offense took place. The city shall also pay the expenses in any matter transferred to district court pursuant to section 40-18-06.2 or 40-18-15.1, in any appeal taken to district court from a judgment of conviction in municipal court pursuant to section 40-18-19, and in an appeal or postconviction matter seeking relief from a conviction resulting from violation of a municipal ordinance. A defendant requesting representation by counsel at public expense, or for whom counsel provided at public expense without a request is considered appropriate by the court, shall submit an application for indigent defense services. For an application for indigent defense services in the district court, a nonrefundable application fee of thirty-five dollars must be paid at the time the application is submitted. The district court may extend the time for payment of the fee or may waive or reduce the fee if the court determines the defendant is financially unable to pay all or part of the fee. If the application fee is not paid before disposition of the case, the fee amount must be added to the amount to be reimbursed under this section. Application fees collected under this subsection must be forwarded for deposit in the indigent defense administration fund established under subsection 4.

         Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to pay attorney’s fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in any order or amended judgment entered following a revocation or other postjudgment proceeding, shall order the defendant to reimburse the presumed amount of indigent defense costs and expenses, as determined by the commission, and shall notify the defendant of the right to a hearing on the reimbursement amount. If the defendant or prosecutor requests a hearing within thirty days of receiving notice under this subdivision, the court shall schedule a hearing at which the actual amount of attorney’s fees and expenses must be shown. In determining the amount of reimbursement and method of payment, the court shall consider the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that reimbursement of costs and expenses will impose.

A person against whom civil recovery is sought under this subsection is entitled to all exemptions accorded to other judgment debtors. The attorney general, state’s attorney, or prosecuting attorney may contract with a private sector collection agency for assistance in seeking recovery of such funds. Before referring the matter to a collection agency, the state’s attorney shall notify the person who is the subject of the collection action.

        This section is construed to permit an indigent defendant, who is to repay for his court-appointed attorney, to claim all the exemptions from process granted to other judgment debtors, and where repayment for court-appointed attorney is made a condition of probation, there must be a finding that probationer is capable, but unwilling, to repay before probation may be revoked for failure to repay; as construed, this section is not unconstitutionally vague, does not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of the federal constitution, does not have an unconstitutional chilling effect on a defendant’s right to counsel, and it is constitutional.

The state’s attorney, or assistant state’s attorney, in the same manner and for the same reasons as the defendant, may obtain a transfer of the action from the municipal judge before whom the action was commenced, or from the district judge to whom it has been transferred on the application of the state, in which event it must be transferred to another district judge designated by the presiding judge of the judicial district. The place of examination cannot be changed more than once by each party under this section.

        North Dakota’s policy of openness in judicial proceedings may at times conflict with a defendant’s right to a fair trial. Such a situation may arise where a motion is made to close a preliminary examination pursuant to this section, and when it does, the trial court must seek to best accommodate these conflicting interests.

       <p>
        Judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering the closing of the preliminary examination as provided in this section where the defendant, with the concurrence of the state’s attorney, requested the closing order and the judge’s stated reasons for ordering the closing were that in the conduct of the examination the court was authorized to receive and consider evidence that may otherwise be inadmissible at the time of trial and evidence that would be offered at the examination was of such a nature that to permit it to come within the general knowledge of a prospective juror would be highly prejudicial to the defendant and deny him his right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.
   Dickinson Newspapers v. Jorgensen, 338 N.W.2d 72, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 372</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Preliminary examinations should generally be open to the public; however, if, upon motion by the defendant and a hearing thereon, the magistrate finds and determines that evidence inadmissible at the trial on the issue of guilt or innocence will be admissible at the preliminary examination, and as a result there is a substantial likelihood that such evidence will interfere with the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial jury, then departure from the policy of openness to the public will be justified.

        A preliminary examination should not be closed unless the trial court finds there are no reasonable alternatives to complete closure. Minot Daily News v. Holum, 380 N.W.2d 347, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        In exercising its discretion under this section, a trial court should close a preliminary examination only upon a showing that evidence inadmissible at trial will be offered at the preliminary examination and that as a result there is a substantial likelihood of interference with the defendant’s right to a fair trial.

        This section allows a magistrate or a municipal judge to appoint persons to “arrange, receive, and approve bail” for traffic violations, and former N.D.C.C. § 29-08-21 (superseded by N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 46) allowed the court to treat the forfeiture of bail as a final disposition of a traffic violation. Together, these sections allowed for the expedited release of individuals arrested for traffic violations without triggering the usual criminal procedures, but did not permit municipal courts to authorize “minimum periods of detention, prior to release pending trial.” City of Fargo v.

      Except as otherwise provided in this section, moneys deposited as bail are the property of the defendant, whether deposited by the defendant or by a third person on the defendant’s behalf. If bail moneys are deposited by a third person, the person must be notified at the time of deposit that the moneys may be paid to the defendant upon final disposition of the case or applied to any fine, cost, or restitution imposed on the defendant. The person may direct, subject to further order of the judge, that the deposited moneys be released to that person upon final disposition of the case. When moneys are accepted by the court as bail, the judge shall order that the moneys received be deposited with the clerk of court. The clerk shall retain the moneys until the final order of the court disposing of the case. Upon release of the moneys held by the clerk, the moneys must be paid to the defendant or pursuant to the defendant’s written direction or, unless otherwise ordered by the judge, as directed by a person who deposited moneys on behalf of the defendant. In the case of a conviction, the judge may order the moneys to be applied to any fine, cost, or restitution imposed on the defendant. The balance of the deposit, if any, must be paid to the defendant. Moneys deposited with the court or clerk of court as bail are exempt from garnishment, attachment, or execution.

No grand jury may remain in session in excess of ten calendar days, unless the judge by written order filed with the clerk of the court extends the session as may be necessary. Unless extended, the grand jury must be discharged at the close of the tenth day of its session. Saturdays, legal holidays, and days in recess must be excluded in computing the duration of the initial or extended session.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Each grand jury impaneled within any county shall inquire into offenses against the criminal laws of the state alleged to have been committed within that county. The alleged offenses may be brought to the attention of the grand jury by the court or by any state’s attorney or the state’s attorney’s designee. The state’s attorney or the state’s attorney’s designee shall inform the grand jury of the alleged offense, the identity of the alleged offender, and the state’s attorney or state’s attorney’s designee’s action or recommendation. As to any offense committed while the grand jury is in session, the state’s attorney or prosecutor may proceed with a preliminary examination or the filing of an information, as provided for by law, and prosecute the charge, and, under such conditions, the grand jury is not required to inquire into such offense. The presentment of an indictment against a person does not preclude the prosecution of such person for the same offense upon a criminal complaint or information previously filed with the court.

        Assertion that the evidence heard by a grand jury was not sufficient to support an indictment serves as a limited ground for challenging the indictment; proper procedure to challenge order of trial court denying motion to dismiss the indictment when insufficiency of evidence is asserted is by application to supreme court for a writ of certiorari, and not to raise the issue on appeal from a judgment of conviction.

     <p>
      Within five days after a first appearance before a magistrate, the person against whom an indictment has been found and presented may make a written demand to the district judge for a copy of the transcript of the testimony given before the grand jury as it relates to that person and the charges against that person. Upon receipt of such written demand, the judge shall issue an appropriate order. If the judge for any reason determines that a copy of a transcript of the testimony cannot be obtained, the person indicted is entitled, but not otherwise, to a preliminary examination, as provided by the statutes or North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure for persons otherwise charged with a crime. Under such conditions, the preliminary examination must be had before a judge of the district court serving the county in which the crime was committed or is triable. Failure to make such demand within the time prescribed constitutes a waiver of the right to the transcript or to a preliminary examination.

The judge shall, upon good cause shown, order the impaneling of a state grand jury which has jurisdiction to investigate and indict for crimes committed anywhere within the state.

The judge granting the order shall impanel the state grand jury from such lists. A state grand jury must be composed of not less than eight nor more than eleven persons and each grand juror shall possess the qualifications of jurors within their respective counties as provided by law. However, not more than one-half of the members may be residents of one county. The members of the state grand jury must be selected and the foremen appointed in the manner provided by chapter 29-10.1 and shall serve a term or terms as provided therein.

      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol11">
       Subject to the provisions of this section, any party to a civil or criminal action or proceeding pending in the district court may obtain a change of the judge before whom the trial or any proceeding with respect thereto is to be heard by filing with the clerk of the court in which the action or proceeding is pending the original of a written demand for change of judge, executed either:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol11a">
         By the personal signature of the party, if an individual, and by the personal signature of an authorized officer or manager, if a corporation, limited liability company, or association; or
        </li>
        <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol11b">
         By the attorney for a party with the permission of the party, in which event the attorney shall file with the demand a certificate that the attorney has mailed a copy of the demand to such party.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol12">
       The demand is invalid unless it is filed with the clerk of the court not later than ten days after the occurrence of the earliest of any one of the following events:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol12a">
         The date of the notice of assignment or reassignment of a judge for trial of the case;
        </li>
        <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol12b">
         The date of notice that a trial has been scheduled; or
        </li>
        <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol12c">
         The date of service of any ex parte order in the case signed by the judge against whom the demand is filed.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol13">
       Any party who has been added, voluntarily or involuntarily, to the action or proceeding after the date of any occurrence in subsection 2 has the right to file a demand for change of judge within ten days after any remaining event occurs or, if all of those events have already occurred, within ten days after that party has been added. In any event, no demand for a change of judge may be made after the judge sought to be disqualified has ruled upon any matter pertaining to the action or proceeding in which the demanding party was heard or had an opportunity to be heard. Any proceeding to modify an order for alimony, property division, or child support pursuant to section 14-05-24 or an order for child custody pursuant to section 14-05-22 must be considered a proceeding separate from the original action and the fact that the judge sought to be disqualified made any ruling in the original action does not bar a demand for a change of judge.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol14">
       The demand for change of judge must state that it is filed in good faith and not for the purposes of delay. It must indicate the nature of the action or proceeding, designate the judge sought to be disqualified, and certify that that judge has not ruled upon any matter pertaining to the action or proceeding in which the moving party was heard or had an opportunity to be heard.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol15">
       Upon the filing of the demand for change of judge, the clerk shall immediately send a copy of the demand for a change of judge to the presiding judge of the judicial district and the judge sought to be disqualified.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol16">
       Upon receipt of a copy of a demand for change of judge, the judge sought to be disqualified has no authority or discretion to determine the timeliness or validity of the demand and shall proceed no further or take any action in the action or proceeding and is thereafter disqualified from doing any further act in the cause unless the demand is invalidated by the presiding judge. The judge sought to be disqualified shall promptly submit to the presiding judge any comments the judge may have regarding the demand. If the presiding judge thereafter invalidates the demand because it was not timely filed or for other reasons, the judge sought to be disqualified shall resume jurisdiction in the case and hear and determine the case to conclusion.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol17">
       If a demand for a change of judge has been made and another judge assigned by the presiding judge of the judicial district, the presiding judge may decline to grant another demand for a change of judge made by a party whose interests in the matter are not adverse to those of the party whose demand was granted. A judge assigned by the presiding judge pursuant to a demand for change of judge is not disqualified upon a subsequent demand for change of judge unless and until the subsequent demand is granted and notice thereof is given to that judge by the presiding judge. A subsequent demand for a change of judge may be made only within five days after receiving notice of the assignment of a judge by the presiding judge pursuant to a previous demand.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol18">
       Upon receipt of a timely filed demand for a change of judge from the clerk of the court, the presiding judge of the judicial district in which the demand is filed shall promptly designate another judge to act in the place and stead of the judge disqualified.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-15s29-15-21ol19">
       The judge designated, after receiving such notice of the assignment from the presiding judge, shall promptly proceed with the hearing or trial, first giving to the parties or their attorneys reasonable notice of the date of the hearing or trial.

        District court properly denied a father's motions for recusal, for change of judge in child support modification proceedings, to hold the mother in contempt of the divorce judgment, and to reconsider because the father waived his issues on appeal regarding recusal, the orders denying his demands for change of judge were interlocutory and not appealable, the father's relentless filing of meritless motions was clearly for purposes of harassing the mother, the court thoroughly explained its reasons for refusing to hold the mother in contempt, and the father failed to establish any contempt on the part of the mother.

        It was error for a successor judge to vacate a prior judge's child support modification order under N.D.C.C. § 29-15-21 based on the fact that a father had moved for recusal of the prior judge before the order was entered because the statute did not apply, so the statute did not deprive the prior judge of authority to enter the modification order, as the statute was not cited as the basis for the recusal motion. Schweitzer v. Mattingley, 2016 ND 231, 887 N.W.2d 541, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 2016).

       <p>
        District court erred in denying a demand for change of judge based solely on its timeliness because the demand for change of judge on the ground of bias was based on allegations of actions of the assigned judge prior to trial. Therefore, reversal of the court's judgment and remand for further proceedings was necessary. Gray v. Berg, 2015 ND 203, 868 N.W.2d 378, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 219</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly denied a father's demands for a change of judge because he did not meet statutory requirements for a change of judge where he did not file a demand for change of judge before the judge he sought to be disqualified ruled on his motion for joinder.

        Trial judge did not err in recusing himself because a father did not explain what knowledge the judge obtained in his personal capacity, the fact that the judge heard testimony in a different residential responsibility case involving the mother did not on its own raise a reasonable question about his impartiality where the relevant circumstances of the prior case were public record when the judge was assigned to this case, and no demand for change of judge was made.

        Court did not err in denying defendant’s demand for a change of judge where defendant’s demand cited only N.D.C.C. § 29-15-21, under which the demand was untimely and did not comply with other requirements, if the demand was intended to rely on bias, defendant’s allegations of preconceived notions were too vague, and the judge’s adverse rulings were not a basis for recusal. State v. Hunter, 2018 ND 173, 914 N.W.2d 527, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 2018), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 139 S. Ct. 804, 202 L. Ed. 2d 591, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 563 (U.S. 2019).

        The provision allowing for a change of judge in domestic relations cases clearly applies only to a proceeding to modify an order after the original action has been concluded.

        Husband was not entitled to a change of judge pursuant to this section because the wife’s motion to enforce the divorce judgment’s division of the husband’s employee retirement account did not invoke a proceeding to modify the original divorce decree, but rather initiated a proceeding to enforce that decree.

        An affidavit of prejudice, filed after the opening of a term of court but before the date to which an adjournment is taken, is not filed within the time limited, and may be disregarded by the court.

        A party is entitled to a peremptory challenge of an assigned judge, without alleging bias or prejudice. However, the party seeking to disqualify a judge must file a timely request before that judge has ruled upon any matter pertaining to the case. State v. Zueger, 459 N.W.2d 235, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s demand for change of judge was properly denied where it was not made before the judge sought to be disqualified had ruled on a matter pertaining to the proceeding, namely, a motion for an expedited trial date. State v. Zueger, 459 N.W.2d 235, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where demands for a change of judge were made in excess of ten days, they were untimely pursuant to subdivision (2)(b) of this section. Adolph Rub Trust v. Rub, 473 N.W.2d 442, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Record showed that defendant intentionally failed to raise issue of trial judge’s bias before trial, and eleventh-hour demand for a change of judge was held to be merely a stratagem to delay the trial. Varriano v. Bang, 541 N.W.2d 707, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this provision makes no reference to a case being scheduled on the calendar, but simply requires a judge to be assigned for trial in order for the ten-day period in which to make the demand for a change of judge to begin to run, the defendant’s demand for change of judge was untimely when made more than a month after notice was given of the judge assigned. State v. Velasquez, 1999 ND 217, 602 N.W.2d 693, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a criminal contempt case arising from a visitation dispute, a demand for a change of judge, filed over a year after the trial judge had been assigned to the case, was untimely under N.D.C.C. §

       </p>
       <p>
        Court did not err in denying the patient's demand for a change of judge because, in response to the petitions for continuing treatment, the judge had made rulings in the continuing case involving the patient and the mental health center, after which the demand for a change of judge was not statutorily permitted. Southeast Human Serv. Ctr. v. M.S. (In re M.S.), 2017 ND 208, 900 N.W.2d 805, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Presiding judge properly denied defendant’s demand for a change of judge because it was untimely; while it appeared from the record that the presiding judge’s determination regarding defendant’s request to disqualify the assigned judge appeared appropriate, on remand, the assigned judge was required to determine whether a reasonable person could, on the basis of all the facts, reasonably question the judge’s impartiality.

       The filing of an affidavit of prejudice against both the presiding judge and the county does not divest the trial judge of authority to order the transfer of the action to another county for trial. State v. White, 21 N.D. 444, 131 N.W. 261, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 113</cite> (N.D. 1911); State v. Boyd, 26 N.D. 224, 144 N.W. 232, 1913 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the trial judge who had been disqualified failed to designate judge who should sit, and where prejudice also existed in county to which case was transferred, supreme court in the exercise of its superintending control would name judge and county where case should be transferred.

       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 29-16-01 did not require a trial court to inform a defendant that the defendant could plead “once in jeopardy,” rather than only guilty or not guilty, because the statute mentioned no advisement obligation. State v. Scott, 2020 ND 160, 946 N.W.2d 704, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 2020).

         Former Jeopardy.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The question of fact of former jeopardy should be presented to jury upon a separate plea of not guilty because of former jeopardy arising from former acquittal or conviction, and the failure to enter such a plea is a waiver of the defense of former jeopardy arising from a former conviction. State v. Barnes, 29 N.D. 164, 150 N.W. 557, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 1</cite> (N.D. 1915).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since a plea of former jeopardy is not a denial of any allegations of the indictment, the burden is upon defendant to prove such plea, and if not proved, it must be answered in the negative without submission to the jury. State v. Taylor, 70 N.D. 201, 293 N.W. 219, 1940 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 1940).

     <p>
      In any case, whether a misdemeanor or felony, a trial jury may be waived by the consent of the defendant and the state’s attorney expressed in open court and entered on the minutes of the court. Otherwise, the issues of fact must be tried by the jury.

        Defendant was denied his right to a jury trial where he was tried by court and record did not reveal that defendant expressly and intelligently consented to waiver of his right to a jury trial; when a written waiver is not submitted, a trial court could eliminate doubt and safeguard rights of a defendant by obtaining an express statement of defendant specifically indicating on record that a jury trial is or is not waived.

        Legislative interference with the size of the jury for a felony trial is not authorized in Art. I, § 13, N.D.

      If a sufficient number of jurors cannot be selected to form a trial jury, the court, as often as is necessary, may order the sheriff to summon from the body of the county as many persons qualified to serve as jurors as the court deems sufficient to form a jury. The jurors so summoned may be called from the list returned by the sheriff, and as many of them not excused or discharged as may be necessary to complete the jury must be impaneled and sworn.

        Under this section, dismissal of the entire panel is proper when there has been a material departure in the process of selecting the panel; this section was not applicable where such process was not challenged.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A party asserting a lack of randomness from the jury selection process must demonstrate a resulting exclusion of a constitutionally cognizable group. To establish there was a substantial failure to comply with the statutory process requiring reversal, the complaining party must provide a factual basis showing the jury panel selection process was prejudicial, actually excluded, systematically excluded, or statistically excluded a fair cross section of the population. State v. Palmer, 2002 ND 5, 638 N.W.2d 18, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        Defendant showed no prejudice from jurors’ aggregate familiarity with the prosecutor because (1) defendant did not claim this caused the jurors to be unrepresentative of the community, and (2) jurors were selected pursuant to statutory requirements.

        Fact that clerk who called panel was also a justice of the peace was not sufficient ground for a challenge to the panel. State v. Lee, 78 N.D. 489, 50 N.W.2d 124, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 107</cite> (N.D. 1951).

       <p>
        Alleged procedural defects in drawing a jury can be taken advantage of only by challenge of the panel before the jury is sworn, and not by motion in arrest of judgment. State v. Probst, 63 N.D. 598, 249 N.W. 711, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 1933).

       An appellate court reviews the trial court’s jury selection procedure using an abuse of discretion standard of review; if the defendant’s ability to exercise peremptory challenges was denied or impaired, relief is justified without a showing of prejudice. However, the defendant must show prejudice when it is alleged that technical errors or irregularities occurred which did not result in the impairment or denial of the defendant’s peremptory challenges.

        Where there is no evidence in the record that the jurors challenged for actual bias had an actual predisposition against the defendant, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to excuse the jurors for cause. State v. Smaage, 547 N.W.2d 916, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1996).

       <p>
        There was no obvious error affecting substantial rights because defendant failed to show that his jury was not impartial, and therefore defendant’s argument that his jury was not impartial because the jury questionnaires revealed that approximately one-third of the persons in the jury pool or their spouses were employed by state or county governments was rejected, because the record showed that the district court asked the jurors whether they could remain fair and impartial and they replied that they could.

        Where defendant and state entered into a plea agreement immediately prior to trial and trial court dismissed, the jury panel telling them that they were not needed because a settlement had been reached, trial court’s recalling of the same jury panel after defendant revoked the plea agreement did not constitute actual bias per se.

        Although a juror testifies on his voir dire examination that the arrest and trial of one accused of crime might indicate to his mind “that there was something in it”, he is not disqualified.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling defendant’s challenge for cause where prospective juror’s testimony during voir dire that she could not be impartial was the result of confusion which arose due to the nature of defense counsel’s questions, and further questioning by the trial court revealed that the prospective juror had expressed no opinion on defendant’s guilt or innocence and that she could be impartial and base her decision on the evidence.

        Where the challenged juror never had a direct attorney-client relationship with the prosecuting attorney, and the relationship that they did have had ended by the time of trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to excuse the juror under subsection (2). State v. Smaage, 547 N.W.2d 916, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In trial of attorney for driving under the influence, trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to excuse for cause a juror who was a former client of attorney’s law firm, where the record failed to show a direct and current client relationship. State v. Thompson, 552 N.W.2d 386, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-17-36, a challenge for cause had to be granted if an implied bias had been established, and the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant defendant’s challenge for cause of two jurors because of their current attorney-client relationship with the prosecutor; however, because defendant used a peremptory challenge to exclude one of the jurors and the other juror was released as an alternate juror before the jury began its deliberations, no biased jurors sat on his case and defendant was not deprived of any rights.
   State v. Jaster, 2004 ND 223, 690 N.W.2d 213, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 368</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's challenge of two jurors for cause, both of whom had previously had a professional relationship with the state's attorneys who were prosecuting defendant. The record showed that any attorney-client relationship between the potential jurors and the state's attorney and assistant state's attorney had ended many years ago. State v. Garnder, 2016 ND 161, 883 N.W.2d 471, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s challenges to jurors who knew or had been represented by the prosecutor were correctly denied because (1) the prosecutor did not currently represent any juror, and (2) jurors affirmed the jurors would be impartial.

The right to a speedy trial in a criminal case in which the charging instrument contains a charge of a felony offense under section 19-03.1-23 or under chapter 12.1-20 is for the trial to begin within ninety days of the date the party elects this right. The prosecution and the defendant shall elect this right within fourteen days following the arraignment. The court may allow the trial to begin later than ninety days of the arraignment for good cause.

       <p>
        Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was violated because (1) defendant timely elected defendant’s right to a speedy trial, and, (2) after denying the State’s motion to continue, finding no good cause was shown, the court rescheduled the case twice outside the required 90-day time period without explanation or finding good cause. State v. Watson, 2019 ND 164, 930 N.W.2d 145, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial where his attempts to invoke Interstate Agreement on Detainers did not constitute a proper request for a speedy trial, much of the delay was attributable to motions filed by the defendant, and the defendant did not demonstrate that his ability to defend against charges was impaired by the delay. State v. Moe, 1998 ND 137, 581 N.W.2d 468, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s request for a speedy trial was denied where he did not elect this right within fourteen days of his arraignment, which was held on June 19, 2006; thus, while defendant did request a speedy trial, his request to be tried within the ninety-day period was untimely.
   Everett v. State, 2008 ND 199, 757 N.W.2d 530, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 222</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not deprived of his speedy trial rights under the United States or North Dakota Constitutions because the reason for the delay was precipitated by defendant's act of effectively firing his first counsel; the extent of the delay involved reasonable scheduling considerations for an anticipated five-day jury trial and the designation of a second court-appointed counsel. State v. Owens, 2015 ND 68, 860 N.W.2d 817, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly rejected defendant's claim that the State violated his right to a speedy trial because, while the district court scheduled a trial 96 days after defendant submitted his request to the Department of Corrections and 82 days after the district court and State's attorney had each received it, the 90-day period began when the district court and the State's attorney received defendant's request for a speedy trial and charges were statutorily required to be dismissed if not brought to trial within 90 days after the receipt of the request and certificate by the court and prosecuting official.
   State v. Gibson, 2017 ND 15, 889 N.W.2d 852, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 19</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denying defendant's speedy trial claim under
   N.D.C.C. § 29-19-02 was not error where the speedy trial demand was made more than 90 days after arraignment, which constituted good cause, and the district court had attempted to schedule the trial as soon as possible.
   State v. Hall, 2017 ND 124, 894 N.W.2d 836, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        Postconviction petitioner's statutory election of a speedy trial right was untimely where the trial was held within 90 days of arraignment. Koenig v. State, 2018 ND 59, 907 N.W.2d 344, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated in two counties because (1) continuances were granted based on the primary witness’s unavailability, (2) delays were short, considering the severity of the crimes, (3) there was no fault by the State, which provided statutorily required information, (4) the State did not have to subpoena the witness, and (5) defendant was not prejudiced, as, while defendant was incarcerated awaiting trial, defendant did not claim another month of incarceration was “oppressive” or caused anxiety or impaired the defense. State v. Watson, 2019 ND 164, 930 N.W.2d 145, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        State’s requests for a second and a third continuance were properly granted as a formal motion was not required, and the delays benefitted defendant by providing him the DNA evidence he wanted, increasing the jury pool, and allowing more time for trial. State v. Mondragon, 2020 ND 21, 937 N.W.2d 531, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the State had not complied with N.D.C.C. § 29-19-06, granting the first continuance was not an abuse of discretion as the two-day delay was not presumptively prejudicial, defendant did not argue prejudice, the charged offenses were not minor, and two witnesses, evidence, and the prosecutor were unavailable. State v. Mondragon, 2020 ND 21, 937 N.W.2d 531, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        State’s motion for a continuance was properly granted where although the court did not address the N.D.C.C. § 29-19-06 factors, the State’s supporting affidavit noted the unavailability of the prosecutor and court ruling on in camera review that required the State to provide defendant with additional redacted records. State v. Mondragon, 2020 ND 21, 937 N.W.2d 531, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not violate defendant’s right to a speedy trial by continuing the trial because his letter requesting dismissal based on a violation of his right to a speedy trial was written to the court while he was represented by counsel, he asserted no factual or legal support for the request, did not include any discussion of the four-part test to be used in reviewing potential speedy trial violations, did not renew or expand on that request with regard to the rescheduling of the trial date or the trial date, and although the general statutory right to a speedy trial applied, the speedy trial period of 90 days did not apply since defendant was not charged under the statutory provisions that triggered the provision.

        Because defendant had a right to a speedy trial and was presumed innocent, his continued pretrial detention at the State Hospital had to be determined under the statutory procedures and safeguards of N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.1.

        District court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's request for a continuance or a dismissal because defendant did not established that he was prejudiced by the State's conduct; the State was not required to call as witnesses all individuals endorsed on the information, and defendant did not appear to have subpoenaed police officers to testify nor did he call them as hostile witnesses.

        Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated in two counties because (1) continuances were granted based on the primary witness’s unavailability, (2) delays were short, considering the severity of the crimes, (3) there was no fault by the State, which provided statutorily required information, (4) the State did not have to subpoena the witness, and (5) defendant was not prejudiced, as, while defendant was incarcerated awaiting trial, defendant did not claim another month of incarceration was “oppressive” or caused anxiety or impaired the defense.

        State’s motion for a continuance was properly granted where although the court did not address the N.D.C.C. § 29-19-06 factors, the State’s supporting affidavit noted the unavailability of the prosecutor and court ruling on in camera review that required the State to provide defendant with additional redacted records.

       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the State had not complied with N.D.C.C. § 29-19-06, granting the first continuance was not an abuse of discretion as the two-day delay was not presumptively prejudicial, defendant did not argue prejudice, the charged offenses were not minor, and two witnesses, evidence, and the prosecutor were unavailable.

        Trial court is vested with a broad discretion in regard to the order of proof at trials, and, except in cases of clear abuse of such discretion, his decision will not be disturbed. State v. Werner, 16 N.D. 83, 112 N.W. 60, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1907).

        It is within the discretion of the court to allow the prosecution to give evidence in aid of the case already made, after the defense has rested, although the evidence is in contradiction of matters sworn to by the prisoner.

        In a gross sexual imposition case where the jury had to unanimously agree which sexual act or acts the defendant engaged in to find him guilty, a district court's failure to include information in the jury instructions identifying the underlying act for each count of the offense or to instruct the jury that it had to unanimously agree on the underlying act for each count constituted an obvious error; the complaint was not read to the jury and a copy of the complaint was not given to the jury with the jury instructions.

        Where the prosecuting attorney has stated the offense charged, and the defendant’s plea, to each juror as he was impaneled, and after the jury had been sworn to try the case, he, in his opening remarks, stated to them the allegations of the indictment in substance, and the plea and the proposed proof, the jurors were sufficiently informed to try the issue regardless of the specific requirement that the indictment and the plea of the defendant must be read to the jurors.

        Inadvertent reading of the information by the trial court, rather than by the clerk or state’s attorney, did not prevent defendant from having a fair trial. State v. Ellvanger, 453 N.W.2d 810, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Because the state had attempted to locate witness earlier, because witness was not a surprise witness, and because the trial court addressed the jury in an impartial manner regarding witness’s belated testimony, the court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the state to reopen its case after it had rested.

        In prosecution for grand larceny of livestock, statement made by prosecutor in open court (while objecting to question inquiring whether codefendant had mentioned any animals to defense witness), that if codefendant had any statement he should get up on the stand himself, was not prejudicial error where other codefendant had already testified, state had no knowledge whether codefendant concerned would take stand, statement obviously was not made for purpose of drawing jury’s attention to fact that defendant had not taken stand, and trial court advised jury that statement was stricken and should not be considered in arriving at verdict.

        Prosecutor’s question to prospective jurors during voir dire proceeding, asking if anybody believed that the state must come forward with a confession from the defendant in every case, did not violate defendant’s constitutional right against self-incrimination or his rights under this section.

        Prosecutor’s statement made during voir dire of the jury, when taken in the context in which it was made, that “someone will not get up and say I did it” did not constitute an improper comment on defendant’s fifth amendment rights and did not violate the rights afforded him by this section. State v. Skjonsby, 319 N.W.2d 764, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 265</cite> (N.D. 1982).

        Defendant’s rights under the Fifth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, N.D.C.C. § 29-21-11, and N.D. Const. art. I, § 12 were not violated by a statement made by a prosecutor during closing arguments because the statement referred to defendant’s failure to deny that a motel room, in which marijuana, cash, drug paraphernalia, and luggage containing men’s and women’s clothing were found, was his when he made voluntary assertions to police prior to the reading of his rights and the statement referred to evidence, not to defendant’s silence.

        State could not appeal the district court's judgment of acquittal because it was a true acquittal where the district court's oral ruling was not a dismissal on procedural grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, but rather was a determination that the State's evidence, which was based an accomplice's testimony, was insufficient to sustain a conviction. State v. Weight, 2015 ND 219, 868 N.W.2d 821, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        In a case in which defendant was found guilty of conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance, the record contained corroborating evidence to satisfy this statute because law enforcement officers testified the surveillance video captured the overdose victim and another individual arriving at the apartment building where they and defendant’s sister, an accomplice, all stated the drug transaction took place; and the other individual testified about the overdose victim showing her the pills at defendant’s apartment inscribed with the letter “M” and number “30,” and those were the pills he overdosed on later that day.

        The purchaser in a sale of marijuana cannot be charged with the same offense with which the seller is charged; therefore, the purchaser is not an accomplice and his testimony as witness in prosecution of seller did not require corroboration. State v. Dwyer, 172 N.W.2d 591, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1969).

        Where evidence that witness is an accomplice is undisputed and not susceptible to different inferences, the witness is an accomplice as a matter of law; but, where such evidence is either disputed or susceptible to different inferences, the question of whether the witness is an accomplice is a question of fact. State v. Thorson, 264 N.W.2d 441, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 238</cite> (N.D. 1978).

        Where defendant delivered marijuana and hashish to two individuals and was charged with delivering controlled substances, the two individuals were not accomplices since they could not be charged with delivery to themselves.

        Where witness and defendant were the only eyewitnesses to murder, and each claimed that the other, acting alone, killed the victim, it would have been very misleading to the jury for the court to have given the jury an instruction to the effect that testimony of an accomplice must be corroborated.

        This section applies only in criminal cases, and “accomplice,” when used in a criminal context, is a term of art with a limited, specific meaning, the statutory definition of which is in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-03-01(1), which is used to gauge the need for corroboration of accomplice testimony. This section requires corroboration of testimony only where the witness could be criminally responsible as an accomplice under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-03-01(1). State v. Pacheco, 506 N.W.2d 408, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        Court erred in dismissing conspiracy to take pheasants in excess of legal limit charge against a defendant who led undercover game wardens on a hunt; because the wardens were without criminal intent, and thus were not accomplices, it was not necessary for the state to corroborate the testimony of the wardens.

        Corroboration is not sufficient if it merely shows commission of offense or circumstances thereof; witness who was present when burglary was planned, who agreed to it, who went with others to store to be burglarized, who waited in car but took no part in actual break-in and slept while actual burglary was committed, who then helped concoct story to tell investigating officers in event any of parties should be questioned and who helped divide loot, was accomplice even though he may have had unexpressed objections to burglary; conviction could not stand where only witness for state other than members of party was store owner who could testify only that store had been burglarized and that some merchandise had been taken.

       <p>
        In a prosecution for larceny, the testimony of recent possession of stolen property by the accused and attempting to discourage the arrest of an accomplice, and the assertion to the wife of the accomplice that he has matters fixed up, are sufficient corroboration to require submission of the case to the jury.

        In cases involving the use of corroborative evidence, it is incumbent upon the trial court to first determine, as a matter of law, whether or not there is any evidence corroborating the testimony of the accomplice, and only after the court has found such corroborative evidence is it allowed to leave the question of the sufficiency of the corroborative evidence to the jury.

        When an accomplice testifies, the trial court must first determine, as a matter of law, whether other evidence corroborates that testimony.

        There was corroborating evidence to support the testimony of an accomplice in a drug case where police found clothes apparently belonging to defendant at a residence where an alleged assault occurred and drugs; moreover, the damage to the residence and the blood evidence found further supported the victim’s story that a violent incident involving defendant had occurred. The evidence placing defendant at the scene was sufficient to connect him with the drugs found under the doctrine of constructive possession; therefore, he was properly convicted of possession of methamphetamine with intent to manufacture, possession of drug paraphernalia for use with methamphetamine, and possession of methamphetamine.

        The purpose of corroborating evidence is to show that accomplices are reliable witnesses and worthy of credit, however, under this section it is not necessary to corroborate every fact testified to by an accomplice; all that is required is that the evidence, circumstantial or otherwise, corroborate the testimony of an accomplice as to some material fact or facts, and tends to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime; and, it is not necessary that the corroborating evidence be sufficient, in itself, to warrant a conviction or establish a prima facie case. Furthermore, the state need not point to a single isolated fact which is sufficient corroboration, as it is the combined and cumulative weight of the evidence other than the testimony of the accomplice witness which satisfies the statute. State v. Burgard, 458 N.W.2d 274, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant’s possession of stolen vehicle in Kansas with plates stolen in South Dakota tended to connect him to its recent theft in North Dakota, and thus sufficiently corroborated testimony of two accomplices for theft conviction. State v. Hogie, 454 N.W.2d 501, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Corroboration of accomplice testimony was sufficient where officer’s testimony established that accomplice’s vehicle traveled to defendant’s mobile home and then returned to accomplice’s business, where the accomplice delivered marijuana to the undercover officer. State v. Burgard, 458 N.W.2d 274, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        When viewed cumulatively, the evidence strongly corroborated witnesses’ testimony about defendant’s involvement in the murders of an elderly couple; there was sufficient corroborating evidence for witnesses’ testimony. State v. Austin, 520 N.W.2d 564, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was more than mere presence or an isolated circumstance where the act of the accomplice’s attempted phone call to defendant’s residence added corroboration in prosecution for delivery of marijuana; the aggregation of circumstances, reinforced with testimony by the narcotics officers, clearly corroborated accomplice’s testimony and linked defendant to the drug delivery. State v. Torres, 529 N.W.2d 853, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 49</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to corroborate accomplice’s testimony where police officer testified he saw defendant sitting in a parked car at the restaurant the accomplice burglarized, police officers testified that they found pry bars in defendant’s car and paint on one pry bar matched the broken window on the restaurant, and the owner of the restaurant testified that a money clip found in defendant’s car was identical to a clip he kept in the cash register. State v. Marshall, 531 N.W.2d 284, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Accomplice’s testimony that defendant was responsible for murder was corroborated by descriptions of defendant given by other witnesses, atomic absorption test results indicating defendant had handled a recently discharged firearm, shoeprints found at crime scene, and defendant’s attempted flight from police and possession of shotgun shell. State v. Garcia, 1997 ND 60, 561 N.W.2d 599, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 874, 118 S. Ct. 193, 139 L. Ed. 2d 131, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5532 (U.S. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence corroborating the testimony of accomplices to link both defendants to a burglary where defendant A was caught fleeing a car just blocks from the crime scene and the car contained items stolen from that scene; and there was evidence that defendant B was with accomplices until shortly before the burglary occurred and afterwards, he was identified by an accomplice as he passed by in a car close to the crime scene and then fled that car when pursued by police, and the car from which he fled contained stolen items from the crime scene.
   State v. Fraser, 2000 ND 53, 608 N.W.2d 244, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s murder conviction because, although there was no independent and direct evidence about the actual trigger person for the victim’s death, the combined and cumulative effect of the other independent evidence tended to connect defendant to the murder and corroborated the testimony of defendant’s wife.
   State v. Gaede, 2007 ND 125, 736 N.W.2d 418, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because appellant and another juvenile were accomplices, the juvenile court’s finding that appellant committed a theft had to be based upon more than the other juvenile’s testimony; however, the record was replete with evidence corroborating the other juvenile’s testimony and connecting appellant to the commission of the theft.
   Molbert v. J.K. (In the Interest of J.K.), 2009 ND 46, 763 N.W.2d 507, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction of conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance where even if the trial court erred by not giving a corroboration jury instruction, evidence from the accomplices' cell phones corroborated their testimony that defendant was the person who sold them the marijuana on the day of the transaction, and thus, any error was harmless.
   State v. Reddig, 2016 ND 39, 876 N.W.2d 34, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        The corroboration of an accomplice’s testimony need not directly link the accused to the crime. Rather, corroboration merely requires that there be evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense committed. State v. Haugen, 448 N.W.2d 191, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        As used in the statute requiring corroboration, “tends” indicates tendency, not certainty. State v. Hogie, 454 N.W.2d 501, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>
        The decision of whether or not to grant or deny a request for a jury view rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Schlickenmayer, 334 N.W.2d 196, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 295</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        During defendant’s trial for murder, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to allow the jury to view the crime scene outside his house; the court admitted exhibits into evidence, including photographs of the area, photographs taken at the crime scene by the police, and photographs of his house.
   State v. Romero, 2013 ND 77, 830 N.W.2d 586, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        By the clear language of this section, it is the mandatory duty of the trial judge to attend a viewing by the jury, and his absence at such viewing was prejudicial and constituted reversible error. State v. Rohrich, 135 N.W.2d 175, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1965).

      The jurors sworn to try a criminal action, at any time before the cause is submitted to the jurors, in the discretion of the court, may be permitted to separate, or may be kept in charge of proper officers. The officers must be sworn to keep the jurors together until the next meeting of the court, to suffer no person to speak to nor communicate with them, nor to do so themselves, on any subject connected with the trial, and to return them into court at the next meeting thereof.

        Because defendant failed to object to the short form admonishment, the district court’s error of failing to properly admonish the jury was not prejudicial and did not affect a substantial right; while the district court did not properly admonish the jury during breaks and adjournment, it did inform the jury of the substance of the statute when it read the preliminary jury instructions to the jury. State v. Pemberton, 2019 ND 157, 930 N.W.2d 125, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 165</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        The temporary cessation of proceedings before a jury for the purpose of hearing a motion is not an “adjournment” within the law requiring admonition. State v. West, 57 N.D. 652, 223 N.W. 705, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 312</cite> (N.D. 1929).

        District court’s failure to admonish the jury under N.D.C.C. § 29-21-28 prior to a 10 minute break was harmless error because defendant did not object, and he did not claim or demonstrate any prejudice.
   State v. Myers, 2006 ND 242, 724 N.W.2d 168, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>
        Although a trial court erred by failing to admonish the jury not to talk about the case or form opinions thereon before hearing all of the evidence prior to a lunch break, as it should have pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-21-28 and N.D.R.Ct. 6.11(b), defendant neither claimed nor demonstrated that he was prejudiced by such error. The trial court’s presumed error did not affect defendant’s substantial rights and thus, under N.D.R.Crim.P. 52(a), the error was harmless.

        Where trial judge admonished entire jury panel at beginning of term not to discuss the case with each other or others prior to its submission to them, and followed that full admonition at appropriate times during trial with a statement to the jurors, “members of the jury, bear in mind the court’s usual admonition”, no prejudice resulted to defendant by trial court judge’s use of a short form of admonition.

        A telephone call received by a juror during deliberations was an impermissible communication under this section, but it did not rise to the level of a denial of a fair trial, and defendant had not shown prejudice or demonstrated he suffered a serious injustice when the juror took the call to discuss a family emergency.

        It was not reversible error to allow one of jurors to visit post office to get his mail where no prejudice resulted to the defendant thereby.

        Where jurors went to a restaurant for lunch in three cars with both a bailiff and deputy sheriff present in two cars and only a deputy sheriff present in the third, and it appeared that no improper influences were used or attempted, no prejudice resulted from the mode in which the jurors were taken to lunch and returned to the courthouse and such separation furnished no ground for a new trial.

        Trial court’s denial of defendant’s motion to sequester the jury during deliberations and the court’s permitting the jurors to go home at nights and return during the days to resume deliberations did not constitute reversible error where the court admonished the jurors to avoid publicity and not to discuss the case and the defendant failed to show any actual prejudice resulting from the court’s actions.

        Where the trial court responded to a written question from the jury concerning the testimony about an exhibit with a written response telling the jurors to rely on their own recollections, it would be unreasonable to conclude that defendant’s presence or absence would have had any effect on the result; there was no possibility of prejudice and the trial court’s error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

        The trial court’s error in communicating with the jury in the absence of the defendant was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where, considering the jury’s requests, defense counsel’s repeated waiver, and the trial court’s responses, it would have been unreasonable to conclude that defendant’s presence or absence would have had any effect on the result.

        In an assault of a police officer case, defendant was not denied a fair trial when the district court answered requests from the jury while defendant was hospitalized as the procedure for answering such requests under N.D.C.C. § 29-22-05 was followed, and every effort to protect defendant’s rights and to avoid any possibility of prejudice to defendant was made. The discussion about the two jury requests while defendant was hospitalized was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

         Request of Jury in Open Court.

        The trial court erred by responding to the jurors’ request for a legal definition in the defendant’s absence and by not calling the jury into open court. State v. Smuda, 419 N.W.2d 166, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>
        District court’s failure to call the jury into open court to observe the effect of the prolonged late-night deliberations was not reversible error under N.D.C.C. § 29-22-05 where the jury was informed that it would be given a break at 6 p.m., it had returned a verdict at 7:35 p.m., and as a result, the jury was not exposed to prolonged late-night deliberations. Furthermore, where the jury submitted written questions, the defendant was present when the court considered how to respond to the jury’s questions; defendant failed to object to the court’s procedure to address the jury questions and failed to show how the court’s procedure constituted plain error affecting his substantial rights. State v. Fehl-Haber, 2007 ND 99, 734 N.W.2d 770, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       <p>
        Given the jury’s 17-hour workday, the lateness of the hour, the district court’s knowledge of the deadlocked jury’s numerical division, the two responses to the jurors encouraging them to continue to try to reach a verdict, the failure of the court to follow the proper procedure in addressing the jury’s questions, and the lack of a record of the in-chamber conferences, defendant’s right to be present was violated and the verdicts were improperly coerced in violation of defendant’s due process right to a fair trial. While each of the errors in defendant’s case, standing alone, arguably might have been harmless, the errors were so intertwined and interrelated that the cumulative effect of the errors required reversal of all three criminal judgments, and a remand for a new trial.
   State v. Parisien, 2005 ND 152, 703 N.W.2d 306, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a trial court committed plain error in responding to a jury’s request for a transcript of a witness’s testimony without calling the jury into open court, the error did not affect defendant’s substantial rights because defendant was not prejudiced by the error; the overwhelming evidence, including the audio recording of the controlled methamphetamine buy, the testimony of a confidential informant, and the testimony of the investigating officer, supported defendant’s conviction for delivery of methamphetamine.

        It was not reversible error for judge, after twenty-eight hours of deliberation, to tell jury they ought to be able to reach a verdict since case had twice been tried at great deal of expense to county.

        Trial court made no error where, in response to jury foreman’s request for another explanation of the offense of aggravated assault, he read the criminal information against the defendant and the jury instructions which set forth various definitions and an analytical simplification of the statute defining the offense of aggravated assault, and after the reading he asked the jury foreman if he understood the court’s answer. State v. Hartsoch, 329 N.W.2d 367, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 1983).

        Trial court’s incorrect statement to the jury that the jury “would not normally receive the testimony of defendant and a police officer but, by virtue of the nature of the instant case, the court granted that latitude and that’s all the transcripts and all the reading you’ll receive” did not constitute obvious error because it was not clear that the jury was denied access to reexamine any evidence or testimony and defendant had not demonstrated that he suffered a serious injustice or prejudice.

        Because the specific crime intended to be committed in the premises was not an element of burglary under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-22-02(1), the jury instruction stating the State was required to prove defendant “then and there intended to commit a crime in the premises” correctly informed the jury of the applicable law, and, under N.D.C.C. § 29-22-05, the district court did not err by referring the jury to the jury instructions in its response to a jury question.

    Finding on charge of previous conviction.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the fact of a previous conviction of another offense is charged in the information or indictment, the jurors, if they find a verdict of guilty of the offense with which the defendant is charged, also must find whether or not the defendant has suffered such previous conviction, unless the answer of defendant admits the charge. In addition to the verdict of “guilty”, the verdict of the jurors upon a charge of previous conviction may be, “we also find the charge of previous conviction true”, or “we also find the charge of previous conviction not true”, as they find that the defendant has or has not suffered such conviction.

     <p>
      If, from the evidence in a trial, there is reason to believe the defendant guilty, and a new information or indictment can be framed upon which the defendant may be convicted, the court may order the defendant to be recommitted to the officer of the proper county, or admitted to bail anew, to answer the new information or indictment. If the evidence shows the defendant guilty of another offense, the defendant must be committed or held thereon, and in neither case may the verdict be a bar to another prosecution. If no evidence appears sufficient to charge the defendant with any offense, the defendant, if in custody, must be discharged, or if admitted to bail, the defendant’s bail must be exonerated, or if money has been deposited instead of bail, it must be refunded, and the arrest of judgment operates as an acquittal of the defendant of the charge upon which the information or indictment was founded.

The court administration fee must include a fee of one hundred twenty-five dollars for a class B misdemeanor, two hundred dollars for a class A misdemeanor, four hundred dollars for a class C felony, six hundred fifty dollars for a class B felony, and nine hundred dollars for a class A or AA felony.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-26s29-26-22ol12">
       In addition, in all criminal cases except infractions, the court administration fee must include one hundred dollars. Of the additional one hundred dollar court administration fee, the first seven hundred fifty thousand dollars collected per biennium must be deposited in the indigent defense administration fund, which must be used for indigent defense services in this state, and the next four hundred sixty thousand dollars collected per biennium must be deposited in the court facilities improvement and maintenance fund. After the minimum thresholds have been collected, one-half of the additional court administration fee must be deposited in each fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-26s29-26-22ol13">
       In addition to any court administration fees that may be imposed under subsections 1 and 2, the court shall impose upon each defendant who receives a sentence that includes community service a community service supervision fee of twenty-five dollars. The community service supervision fee must be deposited in the community service supervision fund. The fees deposited in this fund must be used to provide community service supervision grants subject to legislative appropriations.
      </li>
      <li id="t29c29-26s29-26-22ol14">
       A court may waive the administration fee or community service supervision fee upon a showing of indigency as provided in section 25-03.1-13. District court administration fees, exclusive of amounts deposited in the indigent defense administration fund and the court facilities and improvement fund, and forfeitures must be deposited in the state general fund. A judgment that the defendant pay a fine or fees, or both, may be docketed and if docketed constitutes a lien upon the real estate of the defendant in like manner as a judgment for money rendered in a civil action. The court may allow the defendant to pay any assessed administration fee or community service supervision fee in installments. When a defendant is assessed administration fees or a community service supervision fee, the court may not impose at the same time an alternative sentence to be served if the fees are not paid.

      The court, within ten years of the date of entry of a judgment that imposes a fine, imposes a requirement that restitution or reparation be paid, or assesses costs against a defendant, may order the judgment to be docketed by the clerk of court in the judgment docket maintained pursuant to section 28-20-13 in the same manner in which a civil judgment for money is docketed. The docketing of the judgment has the same effect as the docketing of a civil judgment. The docketed judgment may be docketed in any other county in the same manner, it imposes a lien upon the real property owned by the defendant to the same extent, it is subject to the same statute of limitations, and it is enforceable by execution in the same manner as provided for a civil judgment for money. The court may direct a judgment be entered in favor of a person to whom restitution or reparation is ordered to be paid. That person may enforce the judgment as a civil judgment.

        This section created no “claim of entitlement” in defendants to a compromise of their costs and fees. The statute merely authorizes the board to compromise and settle judgments for such costs and fees, accords the board broad, unfettered discretion in exercising its authority, and the statute provides no objective criteria or standards, nor any significant limitation upon the board’s discretion. At best, the statute creates “an abstract need or desire,” or a “mere unilateral expectation,” of potential benefits; therefore, the statute does not create a constitutionally protected property interest that would give rise to due process rights. Ennis v. Williams County Bd. of Comm'rs, 493 N.W.2d 675, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>
        This section, although granting to the board broad discretion in deciding whether to compromise and settle a judgment for fines and costs, does provide one concrete benchmark: The board is to exercise its authority only “if in the opinion of said board said judgment cannot be collected in full.” Accordingly, a party seeking compromise and settlement of fines and costs must provide information demonstrating that he is, and will continue to be, unable to pay the judgment in full.

       There is no statutory authority which gives the state the right, upon conviction, to collect from the county an amount of money equivalent to the amount of the statutorily mandated fine. The state could not demand payment from a county for an imposed fine which could not be collected from a statutory violator. State ex rel. Rayl v.

        Criminal judgment entered after a district court held a trial anew was reviewed on appeal because it was appropriately designated an appeal, rather than a transfer.

        Because the matter was resolved by pretrial diversion, there was no trial, verdict, or final judgment, the order approving pretrial diversion and the order to pay restitution were not appealable orders; however, although defendant’s appeal was not authorized by statute, the supreme court could and did exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to review the orders.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where indigent criminal defendant has a right to appeal as a matter of law and court appointed defense counsel believes the appeal is frivolous and without merit, the proper procedure is for the court to appoint another attorney to represent defendant on appeal as soon after the initially appointed counsel makes his opinion as to frivolity known to the court as is practical. State v. Lewis, 291 N.W.2d 735, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a second court-appointed counsel is appointed pursuant to the Lewis doctrine, the court-appointed counsel must fulfill the ethical duty to the client and pursue an appeal with full diligence even if the attorney feels the appeal is without merit. State v. Vondal, 1998 ND 188, 585 N.W.2d 129, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s constitutional right to counsel did not attach in an appellate proceeding as there was no federal or state constitutional right to appeal; thus, defendant’s right to counsel was not violated when the trial court neither informed him of his right to counsel nor appointed defendant counsel on appeal from his probation revocation and resentencing.

        There is no provision authorizing appeals from a denial of a defendant’s motion to dismiss the prosecution against him. The right of appeal is purely statutory in this state. Without statutory authorization to hear an appeal, a court will on its own motion take notice of the lack of jurisdiction. State v. Robideaux, 475 N.W.2d 915, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        In defendant’s conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia, defendant’s attempt to appeal the denial of her motion to suppress was not authorized by N.D.C.C. § 29-28-06; the supreme court, however, treated the appeal from the suppression order as an appeal from the judgment.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where trial court stated in the judgment, which it labeled as “Judgment of Acquittal”, that the evidence having been submitted and the court having rendered its verdict thereon, there existed a reasonable doubt as to defendant’s guilt requiring the charge against the defendant to be dismissed, judgment constituted an acquittal from which the state had no right to an appeal. State v. Flohr, 259 N.W.2d 293, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        There can be no appeal from a true judgment of acquittal. There can, however, be appeal from “[a]n order quashing an information or indictment or any count thereof.” City of Dickinson v. Kraft, 472 N.W.2d 441, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 127</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the judgment of acquittal was based upon a lack of evidence as to a factual element of the crime of driving under the influence, i.e., proof that defendant had a blood-alcohol concentration of one tenth of one hundredth percent or more within two hours of operation or control of a vehicle, the order for dismissal was based upon factual elements, which was not appealed under this section. State v. Meyer, 494 N.W.2d 364, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Because the State of North Dakota lacked the ability to realistically appeal the district court’s orders denying a motion to amend the charge against defendant or the order denying a plea agreement, the Supreme Court of North Dakota concluded that the matter was an appropriate circumstance to consider exercising the court’s supervisory jurisdiction and considered the issues raised by the State on the merits. State v. Louser, 2021 ND 89, 959 N.W.2d 883, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 92</cite> (N.D. 2021).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Dakota exercised jurisdiction over the State of North Dakota’s appeal when a district court ordered a reduction in a criminal sentence because the State could appeal as the district court’s reduction of the sentence affected a substantial right of the State. State v. Neilan, 2021 ND 217, 967 N.W.2d 765, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 224</cite> (N.D. 2021).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The state has no right of appeal where, in a prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor, the court advised a verdict, and a verdict of acquittal was returned, and a judgment of acquittal was entered, and defendant’s bondsmen were exonerated, and the defendant was discharged. State v. Kelsey, 49 N.D. 148, 190 N.W. 817, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court advises a verdict, and the defendant is acquitted and cash bail is delivered to him and he is discharged, the state has no right of appeal. State v. Burdo, 54 N.D. 47, 209 N.W. 657, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1926).

        The state may appeal from an order, made at the close of the state’s case, dismissing the information. State v. Allesi, 211 N.W.2d 733, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only an order entered pursuant to the procedural device of a motion to quash, but any order which has the effect of quashing an information is appealable under subdivision 1 of this section; thus, dismissal of an action for insufficiency of evidence is appealable because its effect is to annul the information. State v. Howe, 247 N.W.2d 647, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order dismissing complaint has effect of quashing it, and is appealable under subsection 1 of this section. State v. Jelliff, 251 N.W.2d 1, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion to dismiss a complaint is equivalent to a motion to quash an information, regardless of the court in which the complaint was originally filed. State v. Hanson, 252 N.W.2d 872 (N.D. 1977), decided under former N.D.C.C. § 33-12-40.
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion to quash an information and a motion to dismiss an information are substantially equivalent, and an order which on its face, without more, has effect of quashing an information is appealable by state. State v. O'Boyle, 356 N.W.2d 122, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 392</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order of the district court dismissing a criminal complaint was an appealable order. State v. Swanson, 407 N.W.2d 204, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 325</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court’s dismissal of a complaint charging the defendants with violating the compulsory school-attendance law was appealable by the state under subsection 1 of this section, where the trial dismissed, the complaint because it found the compulsory school-attendance law unconstitutional.
   State v. Melin, 428 N.W.2d 227, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 942, 109 S. Ct. 367, 102 L. Ed. 2d 357, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5035 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A city has a right to appeal pursuant to this section when the complaint alleges conduct violative of a city ordinance which is also expressly prohibited by state statute. City of Bismarck v. Hoopman, 421 N.W.2d 466, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, although labeled a judgment of acquittal, the trial court’s order did not constitute an acquittal, but was, instead, an order which had the effect of quashing an information, the order was appealable by the state under subsection 1. State v. Hogie, 424 N.W.2d 630, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not authorize the state to appeal from an acquittal, but the state may appeal from a dismissal of an information or other order, regardless of its label, that has the same effect as an order quashing an information. State v. Hogie, 424 N.W.2d 630, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order dismissing a criminal complaint has the same effect as an order quashing an information for the purposes of appealability, and can therefore be appealed by the city pursuant to this section. City of Wahpeton v. Desjarlais, 458 N.W.2d 330, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a dismissal is based upon legal conclusions, rather than the resolution of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged, the dismissal is equivalent to an order quashing an information and is, therefore, appealable by the state. State v. Bettenhausen, 460 N.W.2d 394, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state may appeal from an order quashing an information or indictment or any count thereof. This includes the right to appeal from a dismissal, regardless of its label, that has the same effect as an order quashing an information. State v. Thill, 468 N.W.2d 643, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal of an order dismissing complaint which emanated from a pretrial conference, and which disposed of defendant’s motion at a stage in the proceedings before the trier of fact commenced to take evidence, was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. State v. Hammond, 498 N.W.2d 126, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State has the right to appeal from an order of dismissal that has the same effect as an order quashing an information. State v. DuPaul, 509 N.W.2d 266, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        While court unification eliminated county courts, this section still allows the State to appeal an order dismissing a complaint. State v. Serr, 1998 ND 66, 575 N.W.2d 896, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State’s authority to appeal an order quashing an indictment or information includes appeals from orders of dismissal that have the same effect as orders quashing an information. City of Jamestown v. Snellman, 1998 ND 200, 586 N.W.2d 494, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 213</cite> (N.D. 1998).

        District court’s order dismissing criminal complaints because city was not ready to proceed was appealable. City of Jamestown v. Snellman, 1998 ND 200, 586 N.W.2d 494, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 213</cite> (N.D. 1998).

        Trial court’s decision quashing the criminal information against defendant for failing to register as a convicted sexual offender was based upon its legal interpretation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15 and not upon the resolution of any factual element of the crime charged, therefore the trial court’s ruling was not a judgment of acquittal, but a quashing of the information from which the State had a right to appeal under N.D.C.C. § 29-28-07(1).

        Appeal was dismissed because the State was unable to challenge the dismissal of its cases under N.D.C.C. § 29-28-07(1) where it was the party seeking the dismissal after the suppression of evidence in a drug case; the ruling on the motion to suppress was not heard either since it was then moot.

        District court erred in dismissing the felony theft of property count for lack of probable cause because, at the preliminary hearing, the State needed to establish that someone other than defendant had an interest in the property which defendant was not privileged to infringe without consent; the State did not need to have the victim testify as probable cause could be based on hearsay and other evidence that would be inadmissible at trial; a deputy testified that the victim told him that she owned the vehicles and defendant did not have permission to take them; the vehicle was property of the victim; and, even if defendant had a marital property interest in the vehicle, that interest did not prevent him from being prosecuted for theft.

        State was not authorized to appeal the order of dismissal because the written order of dismissal and the trial court’s oral statements at sentencing, together, proved the order of dismissal resolved factual elements of the offense charged and thus, N.D.C.C. § 29-28-07(1) was not applicable. However, the court considered the State’s attempt at an appeal to be a petition for a supervisory writ.

        Appeals by the state pursuant to subsection (5) of this section are limited to appeals from the granting of a motion to suppress under N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 12(b)(3), and from the granting of a motion to return evidence under N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 41(e).

         —Relevance of Evidence Suppressed.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        State’s appeal was timely under N.D. R. App. P. 4(b); although the prosecutor’s statement accompanying the notice of appeal merely parroted the language of N.D.C.C. § 29-28-07(5), the appeal was properly before the court because a review of the facts clearly demonstrated the relevance of the evidence suppressed and the court had jurisdiction under N.D. Const. art. VI, §§ 2 and 6 and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t29c29-28s29-28-07" target="_self">29-28-07.</a></cite>

       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecuting attorney’s statement in support of an appeal of the order granting defendant’s motion to suppress did not satisfy the requirements of N.D.C.C. § 29-28-07(5), because it did not explain the need for the suppressed evidence; the State could proceed with the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia using the non-suppressed evidence.

        Under this section the state is authorized to bring an appeal from an order granting suppression, and the suppression is upheld unless there is insufficient competent evidence to support the decision, or it is determined that the decision goes against the manifest weight of the evidence. State v. Kenner, 1997 ND 1, 559 N.W.2d 538, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the trial court excluded parts of a blood test on the ground that defendant was deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who conducted the test and not on the ground that the evidence was “illegally obtained,” the state’s appeal was not authorized by subsection 5 of this section. State v. Simon, 510 N.W.2d 635, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court excluded the result of the blood test under N.D.R.Ev. 402 and 403, upon what was essentially a pretrial motion in limine to preclude the State from introducing the results of the blood alcohol test into evidence, the State’s appeal was not authorized by subsection 5 of this section. State v. Miller, 512 N.W.2d 469, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress because it did not indicate that it reviewed the patrol car video or considered any other findings in its determination of involuntary consent where the State complied with the statutory requirements, a review of the facts clearly demonstrated the relevance of the suppressed evidence, the implied consent advisory read to defendant did not indicate that refusing the test was a crime. State v. Fleckenstein, 2018 ND 52, 907 N.W.2d 365, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        State’s appeal of a grant of defendant’s motion to suppress was dismissed because the motion was a motion in limine based on evidentiary grounds, and the State did not have statutory authority to appeal from an in limine order excluding evidence based on the physician-patient privilege.

        Motion to Quash Complaint.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of uniformity of practice and procedure, under section 27-08-24, in criminal actions in district courts and in county courts of increased jurisdiction and because there was no real distinction between criminal information and criminal complaint, motion to quash, based on former section 29-14-04 [now N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 12] having reference to criminal informations, was available and could be employed in county court of increased jurisdiction to test jurisdictional and legal sufficiency of criminal complaint; thus, order granting motion to quash complaint was appealable. State v. Hart, 162 N.W.2d 499, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       City, under subsection 1, could appeal from district court order quashing complaint charging violation of an ordinance prohibiting an act also prohibited by statute. City of Minot v. Knudson, 184 N.W.2d 58, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under former laws, an order setting aside an indictment could not be appealed by the state. State ex rel. Shafer v. District Court of Third Judicial Dist., 49 N.D. 1127, 194 N.W. 745, 1923 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 55</cite> (N.D. 1923).

         —Statement of Prosecutor.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        When the state appeals from an order suppressing evidence, the prosecuting attorney should, in addition to the statement prescribed by subsection 5 of this section, provide supreme court with an explanation, not inconsistent with the record, stating the reasons why the trial court’s order has effectively destroyed any possibility of prosecuting the criminal charge to a conviction; prosecutor’s explanation of why the suppressed evidence is essential to the state’s case need not be, although it may be, based upon the record, and it should be included either with the statement prescribed by this section, or in the state’s brief filed for purposes of the appeal. State v. Dilger, 322 N.W.2d 461, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 317</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere recitation of the statutory language of subsection 5 of this section in the required prosecutor’s statement does not give the state an automatic right to appeal an order suppressing evidence; such a mere recitation does not satisfy state’s burden of establishing that the order suppressing evidence has rendered the proof available to the state, with respect to the criminal chargee, so weak in its entirety that any possibility of prosecuting such charge to a conviction has been effectively destroyed. State v. Dilger, 322 N.W.2d 461, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 317</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When state appeals from an order suppressing evidence, supreme court’s review of the sufficiency of prosecutor’s statement filed pursuant to subsection 5 of this section is guided by the utmost deference for the prosecutor’s judgment in evaluating the remaining proof; there is reluctance to dismiss state’s appeal unless the prosecution’s determination of the need for the suppressed evidence is clearly inconsistent with the record or is without foundation in reason or logic. State v. Dilger, 322 N.W.2d 461, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 317</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        State’s appeal from order suppressing evidence will not be dismissed, unless the prosecutor’s determination of the need for the suppressed evidence is clearly inconsistent with the record or is without foundation in reason or logic. State v. Anderson, 336 N.W.2d 634, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 389</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a driving while under the influence prosecution, state marginally established its ground for appeal from order suppressing the result of a blood-alcohol test where the only remaining evidence was that of a witness who observed the defendant in a hospital emergency room after the auto accident and the arresting officer testified that he did not discover any alcohol in defendant’s car and that he lacked the opportunity to observe the defendant immediately after the accident; however, supreme court emphasized that the suppression of blood-alcohol test result alone does not automatically establish a ground for appeal under this section because the state, without the admission of the test result, can establish that a defendant was driving while intoxicated. State v. Frank, 350 N.W.2d 596, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 320</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In appealing an order suppressing evidence, prosecutor’s statement need not be based on the record, but may include other evidence in order to establish that further prosecution without the suppressed evidence would be futile, not just somewhat more difficult. State v. Frank, 350 N.W.2d 596, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 320</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In appeal from order suppressing chemical test results in a DWI case, prosecutor’s assertion that the evidence, in the absence of the suppressed chemical test results, was insufficient because it was “subjective” was insufficient to establish supreme court’s jurisdiction, and the appeal was dismissed. State v. Gawryluk, 351 N.W.2d 94, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 325</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal of an order suppressing evidence, prosecuting attorney may satisfy requirement of explaining reasons for appeal by filing a statement that explains reasons for appeal or by filing a terse statement and providing explanation in a brief; both procedures satisfy requirements of subsection 5 of this section. State v. Kisse, 351 N.W.2d 97, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 327</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        State’s appeal from order suppressing results of a breathalyzer test was dismissed, where suppression order did not necessarily determine outcome of case as there was sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction of driving while under influence without test results. State v. Kisse, 351 N.W.2d 97, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 327</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal of trial court’s order suppressing evidence, requirement that state provide an explanation as to why suppressed evidence is essential to case was satisfied where state provided such explanation in a reply brief rather than with prosecutor’s statement required by this section or in state’s initial brief. State v. Rambousek, 358 N.W.2d 223, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 428</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        State’s attempt to include required prosecutor’s statement in an amended notice of appeal filed after time for taking an appeal had expired did not satisfy requirement of this section that a copy of statement accompany notice of appeal. State v. Grant, 361 N.W.2d 243, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The words “an order . . . suppressing evidence” relate to a decision by a lower court granting a motion to suppress evidence pursuant to N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 12. State v. Miller, 391 N.W.2d 151, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 362</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeals by the state pursuant to subsection 5 of this section are limited to appeals from the granting of a motion to suppress under N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 12(b)(3), and from the granting of a motion to return evidence under N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 41(e). State v. Miller, 391 N.W.2d 151, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 362</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        State’s explanation why the court’s order suppressing evidence rendered the available proof insufficient as a matter of law may be provided in the state’s brief filed for the purposes of the appeal. State v. Thompson, 369 N.W.2d 363, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 330</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assertion of the state in its brief that since the state’s entire case was based on the evidence in question, the judge’s ruling suppressing same left the state without a case at all constituted an adequate explanation of the state’s reasons for appeal in light of the nature and circumstances of the case and the necessary reliance placed by the prosecution upon evidence obtained in execution of the search warrant. State v. Thompson, 369 N.W.2d 363, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 330</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the state appeals from a suppression order, it has the burden to establish that further prosecution without the suppressed evidence would be futile and not merely more difficult. State v. Allery, 371 N.W.2d 133, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 355</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection 5 of this section was amended in 1985 to provide that the prosecuting attorney’s statement must assert only that the appeal is not taken for purposes of delay and that the evidence is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding, but the 1985 amendment did not apply in a case where the state filed its appeal prior to its effective date of July 1, 1985. State v. Whitney, 377 N.W.2d 132, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 437</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       Although a district court abused the court’s discretion in accepting a plea agreement and then subsequently modifying the agreed upon sentence from a term of incarceration to probation to circumvent the plea agreement, the Supreme Court of North Dakota was required to affirm the judgment because the reversal of the judgment would have resulted in increased punishment.

        The failure of law enforcement officers to announce their presence and mission prior to entering through an open door to a house constitutes a “breaking” under this section, requiring suppression of the evidence seized in the subsequent search.

        Given defendant’s inability to maneuver within the dwelling because he was in a wheelchair, the time of night of the search, defendant’s conviction for possessing an illegal shotgun, and that officers had reason to conclude illegal contraband was being destroyed, officers’ 10-minute wait to force entry was not unreasonable.

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to suppress because the state constitution was not violated by law enforcement’s warrantless electronic monitoring of defendant’s face-to-face conversations with an informant when the conversations and drug transactions occurred in the informant’s car and the informant consented to the electronic monitoring; defendant’s suggestion to declare the statute unconstitutional was declined.

        Where there was no dispute that the informant who wore the body transmitter was cooperating with authorities in return for a favorable recommendation to the prosecutor, there was testimony that the informants were fully aware of the nature of the transaction, and the informant wore the body transmitter during the transaction and it was undisputed that he knew the transaction was being monitored, the court concluded that the evidence satisfactorily established the informant’s consent.

        Standard for Investigatory Stop.

      </p>
      <p>
       Officers were not required to actually confirm outstanding warrant prior to making investigatory stop. Such an argument would, in essence, require law enforcement officers to have an “absolute” suspicion that a person had violated the law, as opposed to a “reasonable and articulable” suspicion. State v. Rodriguez, 454 N.W.2d 726, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       Information that defendant was the subject of a felony warrant from South Dakota met the standard of articulable suspicion that the motorist violated the law, which was sufficient to entitle the officer to make a legal investigative stop of the vehicle.

       <p>
        In a forfeiture case, the State had a statutory right to appeal a district court's order because this statute allowed the State to appeal an order granting the return of property; moreover, the State properly appealed because the State Attorney's statement satisfied both prongs of this statute, asserting the purpose of the appeal was not to delay and the property was substantial proof of a fact material in a criminal proceeding.

        Although the promptness requirement in N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-36 does not apply to proceedings under this chapter, and although pending criminal proceedings do not toll the application of the Due Process Clause to commencement of civil forfeiture proceedings, where the money was held as evidence for trial and the time between the end of trial and the institution of forfeiture proceedings was short, there was no constitutional due process violation.

        Because district court erred in its due process analysis of whether a claimant’s due process rights had been violated by a delay in the forfeiture of items seized as evidence for his criminal trial and because findings of fact were inadequate to provide an understanding of the basis used to reach its decision, case was remanded for a new hearing.

     <p>
      Seized property that is not required as evidence or for use in an investigation may be returned to the owner without the requirement of a hearing, if the person’s possession of the property is not prohibited by law, the property is not forfeitable property, and there is no forfeiture proceeding filed on behalf of the seizing agency. The seizing agency shall send notice by regular mail, if the value of the property is less than two hundred fifty dollars, or certified mail, if the value of the property is equal to or greater than two hundred fifty dollars, to the last-known address of any person having an ownership or possessory right in the property stating that the property is released and must be claimed within thirty days. Notice is deemed to have been made upon the mailing of the notice. The notice must state that if no written claim for the property is made upon the seizing agency within thirty days after the mailing of the notice, the property will be deemed abandoned and disposed of accordingly. If there is more than one party who may assert a right to possession or ownership of the property, the seizing agency may not release the property to any party until the expiration of the date for filing claims unless all other claimants execute a written waiver. If there is more than one claim filed for the return of property under this section, at the expiration of the period for filing claims the seizing agency shall file a copy of all such claims with the clerk of the district court and deposit the property with the court in accordance with the provisions of chapter 32-11. If no owner can be located or no claim is filed under this section, the property is deemed abandoned and the seizing agency becomes the owner of the property and may dispose of it in any reasonable manner.

      Forfeitable property may be seized whenever and wherever the property is found within this state. Forfeitable property may be seized by taking custody of the property or by serving upon the person in possession of the property a notice of forfeiture and seizure. If the court finds that the forfeiture is warranted, an order transferring ownership to the seizing agency must be entered and the property must be delivered to the seizing agency for disposition as directed by the court. Property that has been seized for forfeiture, and is not already secured as evidence in a criminal case, must be safely secured or stored by the agency that caused its seizure.

       Property may not be forfeited under this chapter to the extent of an interest of an owner who had no part in the commission of the crime and who had no knowledge of the criminal use or intended use of the property. However, if it is established that the owner permitted the use of the property under circumstances in which a reasonable person should have inquired into the intended use of the property and that the owner failed to do so, there is a rebuttable presumption that the owner knew that the property was intended to be used in the commission of a crime.

       Upon receipt of forfeited property, the seizing agency shall permit any owner or lienholder of record having a nonforfeitable property interest in the property the opportunity to purchase the property interest forfeited. If the owner or lienholder does not exercise the option under this subsection within sixty days of mailing of written notice to such person of such option, the option is terminated unless the time for exercising the option is extended by the seizing agency.

       A person having a valid, recorded lien or property interest in forfeited property, which has not been repurchased pursuant to subsection 2, must either be reimbursed to the extent of the nonforfeitable property interest or to the extent of the amount raised by the sale of the item, whichever amount is less. The sale of forfeited property must be conducted in a manner that is commercially reasonable and calculated to provide a sufficient return to cover the cost of the sale and reimburse any nonforfeitable interest. The validity of a lien or property interest is determined as of the date the property is seized. All costs and expenses of the proceedings for forfeiture and sale, including expenses of seizure, maintenance of custody, advertising, and court costs, must be first deducted from the sale proceeds and paid to the party incurring such costs and expenses.

      Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, in the case of forfeitable property seized and held as evidence of the commission of a criminal offense, the court in which a criminal prosecution was commenced may issue its order, upon motion and after hearing unless waived, for disposition of the property in accordance with this chapter. Notice of the motion must be served in accordance with the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure upon the owner and all persons known to be claiming an interest in the property to be forfeited. The notice must be served at least twenty days before a hearing on the motion unless the time period is waived by all parties claiming an interest in the property. The motion must contain the information required in a complaint as set forth in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.19.html#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-36" target="_blank">19-03.1-36.</a></cite>3. Although no separate forfeiture proceeding is required to be instituted under this section, all other provisions of this chapter apply to proceedings commenced pursuant to this section.

        In a forfeiture case, the State had a statutory right to appeal a district court's order because this statute allowed the State to appeal an order granting the return of property; moreover, the State properly appealed because the State Attorney's statement satisfied both prongs of this statute, asserting the purpose of the appeal was not to delay and the property was substantial proof of a fact material in a criminal proceeding.
   State v. Horning, 2016 ND 10, 873 N.W.2d 920, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        District court's order denying the forfeiture of $16,420 in U.S. currency seized by law enforcement during a traffic stop relied on an erroneous application of the law and was not supported by the evidence. The State's evidence established a probable basis for finding the property was forfeitable drug money, but defendant did not rebut the presumption of forfeiture. State v. Horning, 2016 ND 151, 882 N.W.2d 247, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        In a forfeiture case, a purported owner had an interest in a large sum of money because it was found in his pocket and inside of a cooler in the car he was driving. The cooler contained the cash, the owner's cell phone, and title to a car he had purchased.

        District court did not err in denying a prisoner’s application for postconviction relief based upon the prisoner’s claim that his failure to receive hepatitis treatment while in prison warranted a reduction in his sentence to time served, as the provisions governing postconviction relief are expressly unavailable to seek relief for an inmate’s custodial treatment after he is incarcerated. There were other avenues of relief available for the prisoner’s claims.

        District court properly denied defendant’s application for post-conviction relief because the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation had exclusive discretion to determine whether he should be credited with a performance-based sentence reduction, and the statute at issue was not available to provide relief for disciplinary measures, custodial treatment, or other violations of civil rights of a convicted person occurring after the imposition of sentence, and the second amended judgment expressly provided that defendant was to be given credit for the 307 days he was held in custody prior to sentencing.

        Court did not err in failing to grant petitioner a new trial based on newly discovered evidence in the form of recanted statements where the police had substantial evidence implicating petitioner in the conspiracy case other than the statements of the witnesses.

        The trial court properly denied defendant’s application for post-conviction relief under N.D.C.C. 29-32.1-01(1)(e) where evidence of misconduct that could have been used to impeach the doctor who examined defendant did not constitute newly discovered evidence; the information about the doctor’s background had previously been published, was publicly disseminated and easily accessible and, therefore, defendant failed to establish that the failure to learn about the evidence at the time of trial was not the result of the defendant’s lack of diligence.

       <p>
        District court properly exercised its discretion in denying a petitioner’s request for postconviction relief because, although the petitioner alleged that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and this was newly discovered evidence, even if a hearing were held, the outcome would not have been changed. Moreover, the petitioner never had a trial; rather, he entered a guilty plea and, the petitioner failed to show manifest injustice for withdrawal of the guilty plea.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to summarily deny an inmate’s application for post-conviction relief because the inmate had over two years to produce competent, admissible evidence supporting the inmate’s claim that the inmate had evidence requiring vacation of the inmate’s conviction, but the inmate failed to do so.

       <p>
        Generally, an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is more effectively presented in a post-conviction-relief proceeding than an appeal because the court in those proceedings is the court before which the trial was held. State v. Ricehill, 415 N.W.2d 481, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 436</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the issue of ineffectiveness of counsel may be raised in a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, it is more effectively determined through the State v. Bowers, 426 N.W.2d 293, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, ineffective assistance of counsel claims are most effectively presented in proceedings for post-conviction relief pursuant to chapter 29-32.1. However, when defective assistance of counsel is urged on direct appeal, Supreme Court will review the entire record, and if it cannot readily determine that assistance of counsel was plainly defective and there exist no other grounds for reversal, then defendant can later pursue his claim at a post-conviction proceeding where an adequate record can be developed. State v. Sayler, 443 N.W.2d 915, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Our state and federal constitutions guarantee criminal defendants the right to reasonably effective assistance of counsel; consequently, ineffective assistance of counsel is one ground for relief from a criminal conviction under our post-conviction procedure act.

       <p>
        Where, from its review of the record on appeal, the appellate court could not conclude that defendant’s trial counsel was ineffective, it affirmed his judgment of conviction without prejudice to his right to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in an appropriate post-conviction proceeding.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s determination that all of the issues the petitioner raised in his application for postconviction relief had already been raised in his previous appeal was error, because the petitioner’s claims of ineffective assistance of his trial and appellate counsel had never been addressed, and the merit of the petitioner’s claim, that had counsel raised the issue of lack of probable cause to support a nighttime search there was a reasonable probability the evidence against him would have been suppressed, was never considered.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant argued that he was denied access to relevant information by his trial attorney, his evidentiary hearing attorney, and the Department of Corrections, he did not raise these issues in his initial application for post-conviction relief or his amended application for post-conviction relief; further, defendant did not explain how failure to provide him with a set of the crime scene photographs constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.

       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of postconviction relief was affirmed because the petitioner’s conclusory allegations that counsel failed to call certain witnesses did not support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where the petitioner did not present affidavits from the additional witnesses nor did he have the witnesses testify at his postconviction hearing, and the petitioner’s testimony as to what the witnesses might have said was not sufficient evidence as to what the witnesses would say.

       <p>
        Where defendant failed to supply any competent evidence showing an issue of material fact under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1), his failure to appropriately respond to the State’s motion was fatal and the trial court’s dismissal of his motion for post-conviction relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel was appropriate.

       </p>
       <p>
        Postconviction relief was denied in a case where defendant alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because the decisions were mostly based on a defense strategy, such as the failure to call a handwriting expert and the failure to request a mistrial. Moreover, a motion to change venue would have been futile, and testimony regarding intent would have been irrelevant since that was not an element of the crimes charged.

       <p>
        Defendant’s second application for postconviction relief was denied because there was no claim for ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal since defendant represented himself; moreover, he failed to meet the requisite showing of ineffectiveness pertaining to his first application for postconviction relief. Defendant did not show that the alleged errors of counsel were prejudicial or that the outcome would have been different without those alleged errors.

Jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for post-conviction relief was designed to be vested in courts of general jurisdiction such as the district courts.

        Postconviction relief was properly summarily dismissed on a claim of newly discovered evidence because, even though some of the requirements were satisfied, the applicant failed to establish that the weight and quality of the newly discovered evidence would have likely resulted with an acquittal at trial; in addition to the overwhelming evidence against the applicant, the independent physical evidence suggested that much of the testimony was not fabricated.

        Petitioner did not provide competent, admissible, newly discovered evidence sufficient to grant an evidentiary hearing, did not show an abuse of discretion in the district court’s order summarily dismissing his application for post-conviction before ruling on his discovery motions, and the legality of an anticipatory search warrant issued for his criminal conviction could not be challenged at this stage of post-conviction relief.

       <p>
        District court did not err in denying an application for postconviction relief on the basis of newly discovered evidence where, contrary to petitioner’s arguments, a receipt did not show that the timeline of the charged incidents was inaccurate in light of the victim’s testimony, and even if had been admitted, it was not inconsistent with the evidence that another trip was when the first instances of sexual assault occurred.

        Defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief based on newly discovered evidence because (1) text messages were not newly discovered, as defendant’s mother possessed the messages, defendant’s failure to learn about the messages was due to a lack of diligence, and the messages’ weight and quality was unlikely to result in an acquittal, and (2) sexual assault kit results were not newly discovered, as counsel most likely provided the results to defendant before trial.

        Denial of post-conviction relief was proper when (1) an inmate failed to show selective prosecution; (2) there was no authority that post-conviction relief was available for pretrial bail orders; (3) the inmate did not specify how and where his trial counsel was incompetent or establish a reasonable probability that, but for his attorney’s asserted errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different; and (4) the inmate provided no support for his remaining claims.

        Where appellant pled guilty to indecent exposure and was sentenced to 12 months in prison, appellant’s complaint that female prison guards watched him shower and that the State should therefore be estopped from complaining of his conduct did not support his position that his conviction should be reversed. Appellant’s conviction for indecent exposure was affirmed as he failed to establish any legal basis for relief under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act or under N.D.R.Crim.P. 35.

        Court properly denied petitioner’s motion for new trial because, even if a witness’s statement were admitted into evidence and jurors inferred that a third party struck the victim outside petitioner’s presence, petitioner would still likely have been found guilty of murder. The witness’s statement did not demonstrate that petitioner’s actions were clearly insufficient to cause the victim’s death, and did not eliminate petitioner’s culpability for the murder

        Court properly denied petitioner’s motion for new trial because petitioner failed to establish that a witness’s testimony was likely to result in an acquittal because petitioner failed to produce any evidence as to what the testimony would have been, and due to that failure, the district court found that petitioner failed to establish entitlement to post-conviction relief on the basis of the witness’s availability.

        Denial of postconviction relief was proper, because at the change of plea hearing the court found the State’s offer of proof established an adequate factual basis for the charge and proved the petitioner was likely to be convicted if his case proceeded to trial, and the petitioner failed to show he received ineffective assistance of counsel, when counsel took adequate steps to ensure the petitioner understood the proceedings, including meeting with the petitioner on a number of occasions, reading documents to the petitioner and discussing the nature of the case and the plea offers with the petitioner.

        Denial of post-conviction relief was proper, because an administrative rule delineated JWH-018 1-Pentyl-3 (1-naphthoyl) indole (JWH-018) as a prohibited controlled substance when petitioner committed the alleged acts, the administrative rule had force and effect of law upon becoming effective, and subsequent codification of JWH-018 as a prohibited controlled substance did not invalidate the effect of the final administrative rule.

        It was an abuse of discretion to deny an inmate's N.D. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion to reopen a post-conviction relief application because, (1) although the application had been dismissed without prejudice, it was effectively dismissed with prejudice, since it was subject to a new two-year statute of limitations, so the dismissal was a final order for purposes of N.D. R. Civ. P. 60(b), (2) the motion was filed under prior law, (3) the trial court considered matters outside the application when considering prior post-conviction relief motions, (4) the court did not give the inmate notice that the inmate was being put to the inmate's proof or a chance to submit evidence of a genuine material fact issue, and (4) the N.D.

        The Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act was never intended to create a new remedy to wholly replace habeas corpus and the other common-law writs. Rather, the Uniform Act creates a procedure which implements the writ of habeas corpus and provides an opportunity for more extensive development of the issues and a more complete record for review. Jensen v. State, 373 N.W.2d 894, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 394</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        The appeal provisions of former chapter 29-32 were a cumulative, and not a superseding, remedy, and the right of the people to invoke the original jurisdiction of the supreme court in habeas corpus was still viable. Thus, an unsuccessful applicant for post-conviction relief could seek appellate review pursuant to former section 29-32-09 or could petition the supreme court for an original writ of habeas corpus. Jensen v. State, 373 N.W.2d 894, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 394</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        In an appeal from a judgment under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act, the supreme court applies the “clearly erroneous” standard of N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 52(a) in reviewing fact questions. Rule 52(a) is inapplicable in original habeas corpus proceedings, and the supreme court reviews the record de novo. Thus, the court’s review of fact issues is more liberal under its original habeas corpus jurisdiction than it would be in an appeal under the Uniform Act. Jensen v. State, 373 N.W.2d 894, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 394</cite> (N.D. 1985).

The requirements of N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-03 that the State be named as respondent, a copy of the application be delivered to the state’s attorney, and the State answer the application, all indicate post-conviction relief under N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1 exists only in the district court, not in the municipal court.

        Post-conviction relief application was improperly dismissed on a trial court’s own motion under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-06(2) because it was not impossible for an applicant to prove a claim upon which relief could have been granted; ineffectiveness of trial counsel was a ground for granting relief that generally could not have been summarily decided. Although the trial court had the inherent authority to summarily dismiss an application on its own initiative, there had to be no dispute as to the material facts or the inferences to be drawn from the undisputed facts before a dismissal could have been entered pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09; the trial court did not comply with the requirements of N.D.R.Civ.P. 56 and N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1) because the applicant was not given notice and an opportunity to respond and submit evidence before dismissal.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to summarily deny an inmate’s application for post-conviction relief because the inmate had over two years to produce competent, admissible evidence supporting the inmate’s claim that the inmate had evidence requiring vacation of the inmate’s conviction, but the inmate failed to do so.

        District court erred in summarily dismissing defendant's application for post-conviction relief because defendant raised reasonable inferences creating a genuine issue of material fact regarding his counsel's trial performance with respect to the use of a surveillance video and was entitled to an evidentiary hearing inasmuch as what the video depicted was a disputed fact, defendant's specific references to the transcript and the video were both competent admissible evidence, and, if the video showed what defendant alleged, it could have been used to rebut or impeach the testimony of the alleged victim of one of the terrorizing charges and perhaps bolster defendant's own testimony.

        Where an application for post-conviction relief is not frivolous, it is improper for trial court to summarily deny the application before the defendant is afforded an opportunity to provide evidentiary support for the allegations in the application. State v. Bender, 1998 ND 72, 576 N.W.2d 210, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 1998).

        Post-conviction relief was properly denied in a case alleging ineffectiveness of counsel because appellant applicant did not present any affidavits or supporting materials after the State requested summary disposition; moreover, he did not inform the district court that he had witnesses to present. If the applicant thought that the district court denied him the opportunity to present testimony, an offer of proof should have been made under

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's post-conviction relief motion, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct, was properly denied by summary disposition because (1) the application had to refer to the portions of the record pertinent to the alleged grounds for relief, but the grounds for relief relied solely on unsupported, conclusory allegations, and, (2) after the State moved for summary disposition, it was defendant's burden to present competent, admissible evidence capable of raising issues of material fact, which was not met.

       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in summarily denying defendant's application for post-conviction relief and his subsequent motion for reconsideration because defendant alleged his counsel failed to zealously represent him during his criminal proceeding and plea agreement, which was a genuine issue of material fact, and the district court erred as a matter of law in considering information outside the pleading without allowing defendant to file a brief with supporting materials.

        Supreme Court of North Dakota held that post-conviction relief under N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1 was not available in municipal courts in North Dakota, because municipal courts were not courts of record under N.D.C.C. § 27-01-01 and N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1 refers to the record below in N.D.C.C. §§ 29-32.1-04(2), 29-32.1-10(1), (2). If an appeal from municipal court directly to the Supreme Court was proper, review would be impossible because of the lack of a record; therefore, the municipal court judgment denying petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief was void.

        The actual appointment of counsel remains discretionary with the court pursuant to the requirements of this section. State v. DeCoteau, 464 N.W.2d 605, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The appointment of counsel is discretionary, but applications for court-appointed counsel should be read in a light most favorable to the applicant, and if a substantial issue of law or fact may exist, counsel should be appointed.

       <p>
        Although the Supreme Court would not reverse the trial court’s refusal to appoint counsel for defendant seeking post-conviction relief, the Supreme Court directed the trial court to reconsider its denial in view of the Supreme Court’s remand for an evidentiary hearing for defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. DeCoteau v. State, 1998 ND 199, 586 N.W.2d 156, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the defendant’s request for post-conviction counsel where defendant’s challenge to his sentence failed to raise a substantial issue of fact or law and was completely without merit.

        The appointment of an attorney to assist an indigent post-conviction relief applicant is discretionary; however, trial judges ordinarily would be well advised to appoint counsel for most indigent applicants and should appoint counsel where the indigent applicant is unable to file any application without assistance or where, reading the application in a light most favorable to the applicant, a substantial issue of law or fact may exist.

        Trial court properly denied indigent applicant’s request for appointment of an attorney to assist him in postconviction relief proceedings where he was able to file his application for postconviction relief without assistance and his application, read most favorably toward him, did not raise the possibility of a substantial issue of fact or law.

        Trial court properly dismissed the petitioner’s application for post-conviction release when he failed to show an excuse for not presenting seven of his claims for relief in the proceeding leading to the conviction. Steinbach v. State, 2003 ND 46, 658 N.W.2d 355, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable to actions under the post-conviction relief act and, since matters outside the pleadings were raised by the State in its motion to dismiss petitioner’s motion for post-conviction relief, the rule governing summary judgment motions was applicable. Because petitioner was not given 30 days in which to respond to the State’s brief as required by N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 56(c), the trial court’s judgment dismissing the inmate’s application for post-conviction relief pursuant to N.D.C.C. § § 29-32.1-06(2) and 29-32.1-09 was reversed.
   Kaiser v. State, 2005 ND 49, 693 N.W.2d 26, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 2005).

        Post-conviction relief application was improperly dismissed on a trial court’s own motion under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-06(2) because it was not impossible for an applicant to prove a claim upon which relief could have been granted; ineffectiveness of trial counsel was a ground for granting relief that generally could not have been summarily decided. Although the trial court had the inherent authority to summarily dismiss an application on its own initiative, there had to be no dispute as to the material facts or the inferences to be drawn from the undisputed facts before a dismissal could have been entered pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09; the trial court did not comply with the requirements of N.D.R.Civ.P. 56 and N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1) because the applicant was not given notice and an opportunity to respond and submit evidence before dismissal.

       </p>
       <p>
        Summary disposition on defendant's claim for ineffective assistance of counsel was appropriate because defendant provided no affidavits or other comparable evidence to satisfy defendant's burden of presenting competent admissible evidence to raise an issue of material fact on defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, defendant failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact showing that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in the context of defendant's guilty plea.

       </p>
       <p>
        State's response to a postconviction application was timely under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-06 where the 30th day from the date of docketing fell on a Saturday, the following Monday was a legal holiday, service was made electronically, which added three days to the N.D. R. Civ. P. 6(a) period, and with those additional days, the response was timely. Koenig v. State, 2018 ND 59, 907 N.W.2d 344, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the State's response to petitioner's application for postconviction relief was untimely, N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-06 gave the district court discretion to give additional time to respond, and petitioner failed to show any real prejudice due to the delayed response. Koenig v. State, 2018 ND 59, 907 N.W.2d 344, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Dismissing an inmate’s post-conviction relief application alleging ineffective assistance of counsel erred because, whether or not the State submitted anything outside the pleadings to support the State’s summary disposition motion, the inmate’s allegations, construed in the light most favorable to the inmate, stated a claim upon which relief could be granted and did not show it was impossible for the to prove the claim. Burden v. State, 2019 ND 178, 930 N.W.2d 619, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Failure of the State to respond within thirty days after the application was docketed, although serious and distressing, does not entitle the petitioner to a default judgment. Bell v. State, 1998 ND 35, 575 N.W.2d 211, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the State did not timely respond to petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief, the district court reviewed all of the transcripts from his prior proceedings involving his guilty plea and found no merit to his application. Likewise, petitioner failed to show he suffered any prejudice by the State’s failure to timely respond; the 30-day time period for the State to respond under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-06(1) was not mandatory, and it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny petitioner’s request for default judgment.
   Gamboa v. State, 2005 ND 48, 693 N.W.2d 21, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in denying appellant’s motion for default judgment on the basis that the State failed to respond to his January 26, 2005, application for post-conviction relief until April 8, 2005. N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-06(1) only required the State to respond to a motion for post-conviction relief within 30 days or within any further time the court allowed.

        Petitioner did not provide competent, admissible, newly discovered evidence sufficient to grant an evidentiary hearing, did not show an abuse of discretion in the district court’s order summarily dismissing his application for post-conviction before ruling on his discovery motions, and the legality of an anticipatory search warrant issued for his criminal conviction could not be challenged at this stage of post-conviction relief.

        When a petitioner for postconviction relief sought DNA testing of evidence 30 years after his conviction, the clerk of court’s testimony regarding the existing evidence was sufficient to establish a prima facie case under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-15(2)(b), but the petitioner was unable to show that the remaining evidence for which he requested testing, apart from its having been received at trial, was subject to a sufficient chain of custody or was even still in existence. The supreme court concluded the petitioner did not establish a prima facie case under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-15(2)(b); the petitioner had the opportunity to conduct discovery under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-08 to locate the missing evidence, but there was no evidence indicating he did so, and he was unable to seek that remedy on appeal.

        Although this section permits discovery in post-conviction proceedings upon order of the court or agreement of the parties, where former husband did not attempt to use this procedure to obtain the records he claimed would prove his assertions and because he failed to present evidence of what those records would show, Supreme Court could not conclude trial counsel’s failure to obtain and present them prejudiced him; the evidence did not establish that, but for counsel’s failure to obtain these records, there was a reasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to deny an inmate’s motion to depose a witness to obtain new evidence supporting the inmate’s application for post-conviction relief because, after seven months, counsel could not secure minimal evidence to support the inmate’s speculative, unsubstantiated assertion that the witness had evidence a State’s witness lied at the inmate’s trial.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to deny an inmate’s motion to depose a witness to obtain new evidence supporting the inmate’s application for post-conviction relief because (1) the evidence was found after trial, (2) the inmate could have discovered the witness before or during trial and elicited a statement, and, (3) while the evidence was material, the weight and quality of the evidence would not likely result in an acquittal, as other evidence undercut the inmate’s assertion that the evidence would show the inmate acted in self-defense.

        Postconviction relief was properly summarily dismissed on a claim of newly discovered evidence because, even though some of the requirements were satisfied, the applicant failed to establish that the weight and quality of the newly discovered evidence would have likely resulted with an acquittal at trial; in addition to the overwhelming evidence against the applicant, the independent physical evidence suggested that much of the testimony was not fabricated.

       <p>
        Summary disposition on defendant's claim for ineffective assistance of counsel was appropriate because defendant provided no affidavits or other comparable evidence to satisfy defendant's burden of presenting competent admissible evidence to raise an issue of material fact on defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, defendant failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact showing that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in the context of defendant's guilty plea.
   Stewart v. State, 2017 ND 77, 891 N.W.2d 727, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 2017).

       <p>
        District court did not err by summarily dismissing defendant's application for post-conviction relief because he did not meet his minimal burden of supporting his application with competent, admissible evidence raising an issue of material fact. Atkins v. State, 2017 ND 290, 904 N.W.2d 738, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 299</cite> (N.D. 2017).

       <p>
        Because the district court found petitioner's speedy trial rights were not violated as a matter of law, and petitioner failed to establish a claim or right to relief, an evidentiary hearing on those issues was unnecessary, and summary dismissal was appropriate. Koenig v. State, 2018 ND 59, 907 N.W.2d 344, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner did not provide competent, admissible, newly discovered evidence sufficient to grant an evidentiary hearing, did not show an abuse of discretion in the district court’s order summarily dismissing his application for post-conviction before ruling on his discovery motions, and the legality of an anticipatory search warrant issued for his criminal conviction could not be challenged at this stage of post-conviction relief. Chatman v. State, 2018 ND 77, 908 N.W.2d 724, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary denial of postconviction relief on an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim was proper as there was no issue of material fact as to petitioner testifying at trial, and since the State’s use of images on presentation slides during closing argument was insufficiently prejudicial to violate due process, failing to preserve the images was not ineffective assistance. Kalmio v. State, 2018 ND 182, 915 N.W.2d 655, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        District court did not err in summarily disposing of petitioner’s claims that he was not provided with particular information or allowed to submit particular information in the context of his guilty plea where the record clearly and unambiguously demonstrated the contrary. Stein v. State, 2018 ND 264, 920 N.W.2d 477, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       <p>
        District court did not err in summarily dismissing defendant’s motion for relief from an order denying an application for post-conviction relief because the issue regarding the July 2012 hotel receipt had been previously raised in his April 2017 application for post-conviction relief. Kovalevich v. State, 2019 ND 210, 932 N.W.2d 354, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in summarily dismissing defendant’s November 2018 application for post-conviction relief regarding the February and August 2012 hotel receipts as defendant was aware of the receipts and had complete access to the receipts before trial; he could have raised that issue at trial or at the very latest, in his April 2017 application for post-conviction relief; and those receipts, which defendant argued would impeach the victim’s testimony, would not likely result in an acquittal. Kovalevich v. State, 2019 ND 210, 932 N.W.2d 354, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly summarily disposed of defendant’s fifth application for post-conviction relief because he did not respond to the State’s assertion that the claims were untimely and barred by res judicata. Wisham v. State, 2020 ND 250, 950 N.W.2d 762, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the district court erred in dismissing appellant’s application for post-conviction relief without giving him notice, the error was harmless because the application made no mention of newly discovered evidence; without even alleging he had new evidence, appellant failed to show he was prejudiced by lack of notice. Atkins v. State, 2021 ND 83, 959 N.W.2d 588, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly denied appellant’s application for post-conviction relief because it did not err in concluding appellant’s claims had been presented in previous petitions or had been previously decided by the supreme court and were barred by res judicata; appellant had brought repeated applications for relief on the same or similar grounds for the same underlying conviction. Atkins v. State, 2021 ND 83, 959 N.W.2d 588, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court reached the correct result applying the doctrine of res judicata prior to the State responding, but for the wrong reason, because when the district court used the term “res judicata,” it should have referred to the authority granted under subsection (1), rather than the affirmative defense statute; subsection (1), expressly allows the district court to consider whether an application for relief is successive, and upon determining it is, to summarily dismiss. Atkins v. State, 2021 ND 83, 959 N.W.2d 588, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 2021).

        District court erred in summarily dismissing defendant’s application for post-conviction relief because defendant was not provided with notice and an opportunity to present evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact as to his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.

        District court erred in making factual findings on the State’s affirmative defense of laches and in summarily dismissing petitioner’s post-conviction relief application on that ground; however, because the State moved for summary disposition, petitioner was put to her proof, and the burden shifted to her to support her application with evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. Lindsey v. State, 2014 ND 174, 852 N.W.2d 383, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 2014).

       <p>
        It was an abuse of discretion to deny an inmate's N.D. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion to reopen a post-conviction relief application because, (1) although the application had been dismissed without prejudice, it was effectively dismissed with prejudice, since it was subject to a new two-year statute of limitations, so the dismissal was a final order for purposes of N.D. R. Civ. P. 60(b), (2) the motion was filed under prior law, (3) the trial court considered matters outside the application when considering prior post-conviction relief motions, (4) the court did not give the inmate notice that the inmate was being put to the inmate's proof or a chance to submit evidence of a genuine material fact issue, and (4) the N.D. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion and appeal were timely. Riak v. State, 2015 ND 120, 863 N.W.2d 894, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 2015).

       <p>
        District court erred in summarily dismissing petitioner's application for post-conviction relief in which petitioner asserted ineffective assistance of his trial counsel. Petitioner and his trial counsel's contradictory and varying accounts, on their face, raised fact issues regarding his counsel's pretrial preparation and trial performance, in addition to purported conflict of interest claims.
   Chase v. State, 2017 ND 192, 899 N.W.2d 280, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 196</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        District court erred in summarily dismissing the allegation that petitioner was not informed that he would be required to serve at least 85 percent of any period of incarceration where the court had not addressed the allegation or petitioner’s contention that had he been informed of that requirement, he would not have pled guilty. Stein v. State, 2018 ND 264, 920 N.W.2d 477, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Granting summary disposition dismissing an inmate’s post-conviction relief application erred because (1) the inmate was not put to the inmate’s proof until the State moved for summary dismissal, when the inmate had 30 days to respond, and (2) the application was summarily dismissed before that 30-day period expired. Burden v. State, 2019 ND 178, 930 N.W.2d 619, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary dismissal of defendant’s motion to vacate judgment and withdraw guilty plea was not appropriate because defendant’s application for post-conviction relief was summarily dismissed subsequent to the State’s response and without proper notice; because the State filed its answer, defendant should have been provided proper notice that the district court intended to summarily dismiss his motion. State v. Vogt, 2019 ND 236, 933 N.W.2d 916, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 243</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary dismissal of defendant’s post-conviction relief application erred because, (1) once the State responded, summary dismissal on the court’s motion was no option, and, (2) when the court treated the State’s response as a motion to dismiss, defendant was entitled to notice, which was not given. Chase v. State, 2019 ND 214, 932 N.W.2d 529, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        District court erred in summarily dismissed petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief after the State had responded but prior to the expiration of the time for a response by petitioner because the statute allowed him an opportunity to respond; the mistake was prejudicial, and the appropriate remedy was to reverse and remand to provide petitioner with an opportunity to respond. Friesz v. State, 2021 ND 37, 956 N.W.2d 338, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in summarily dismissing defendant’s application for post-conviction relief because the order did not address the specific claims asserted in defendant’s verified amended post-conviction relief application, the lengthy delays by his post-conviction counsel to obtain the blood testing initially appear to be due to inexperience, delays in dealing with the State and the private lab, and possibly COVID-19 issues, and the court did not address the specific claims of defendant’s amended application alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, did not undertake any analysis under Strickland, and did not adequately explain why an evidentiary hearing on the application was no longer necessary. Campbell v. State, 2021 ND 45, 956 N.W.2d 387, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary dismissal of an application for postconviction relief was improper because the State requested summary dismissal in its answer instead of filing a motion for summary disposition. A motion for summary disposition has to be made consistent with North Dakota’s rules for motion practice, and Delvo v. State, 2010 N.D. 78, 782 N.W.2d 72, and Chisholm v. State, 2020 N.D. 19, 937 N.W.2d 520, were overruled to the extent they approved of an inconsistent procedure. Van Chase v. State, 2021 ND 206, 966 N.W.2d 557, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        The Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act authorizes summary disposition only if “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” State v. Wilson, 466 N.W.2d 101, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Trial court properly dismissed the petitioner’s application for post-conviction release when he failed to show an excuse for not presenting seven of his claims for relief in the proceeding leading to the conviction. Steinbach v. State, 2003 ND 46, 658 N.W.2d 355, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Granting of the state’s motion for summary disposition of the inmate’s application for post-conviction relief was proper where the state indicated that the inmate failed to provide any evidence to support his allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel; the burden then shifted to the inmate to provide some competent evidence to support his allegation, which he failed to do. Weaver v. State, 2003 ND 47, 658 N.W.2d 352, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        Defendant was not entitled to a hearing or post-conviction relief because he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that he was prejudiced by his counsel’s failure to pursue the appeal of his conviction where the amended judgment merely corrected a clerical mistake in the original judgment by including the statutorily required mandatory minimum sentence that the trial court originally orally imposed. A nunc pro tunc order was appropriate to correct this clerical omission and defendant’s absence when the amended judgment and commitment was entered did not affect any of his substantial rights. Sampson v. State, 506 N.W.2d 722 (N.D. 1993), overruled on other grounds, Whiteman v. State, 2002 ND 77, 643 N.W.2d 704 (2002), but see Whiteman v. State, 2002 ND 77, 643 N.W.2d 704, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s arguments regarding his sentence did not raise an issue of fact which would make an evidentiary hearing necessary because the intent of the sentencing court could be determined from the face of the criminal judgments and the sentencing court’s clarifying order; therefore, no evidentiary hearing on that issue was necessary and the trial court did not err in refusing to hold one.
   Crumley v. State, 2000 ND 110, 611 N.W.2d 165, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 107</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a genuine issue of material fact existed, the trial court should not have granted N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09 summary disposition to the State on defendant’s second application for post-conviction relief upon determining that res judicata under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-12(1) and misuse of process under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-12(2) barred defendant’s right to relief. The genuine issue of material fact that defendant raised was that certain issues, including the State’s alleged violation of N.D.R.Ev. 609(a)(1) by admitting evidence of prior instances of defendant committing domestic violence, were not pursued earlier because post-conviction counsel did not develop the evidentiary record, and that issue had to be considered in an evidentiary hearing.

        Conclusory allegations about trial counsel’s failure to call certain witnesses at trial without identifying the potential witnesses, indicating what their testimony would have been, or indicating how their testimony might have affected the outcome of the trial, were insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact, and a hearing was not required and post-conviction relief was not warranted. Hopfauf v. State, 1998 ND 30, 575 N.W.2d 646, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1998), overruled in part, Whiteman v.

        Where the state did not allege in its motion and supporting brief that the defendant’s application for post-conviction relief should be dismissed because no genuine issue of material fact existed, the defendant was under no duty to put forth evidentiary support for the allegations in his application, and the district court erred in summarily dismissing his claims.

        Even though trial court made erroneous findings of fact corresponding to another application for post-conviction relief filed by inmate, trial court did not err in summarily dismissing his application given that his stated grounds for relief had either been fully and fairly determined in his previous direct appeal, see N.D.C.C. 29-32.1-12(1), or he inexcusably failed to raise them in that appeal, see N.D.C.C. 29-32.1-12(2).

        District court properly granted summary dismissal, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1), of a postconviction relief petitioner’s claim that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made; although the district court did not inform petitioner that he would be required, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-9.1, to serve 85 percent of his sentence, the 85 percent rule was imposed as a condition of parole and was not a mandatory minimum sentence requiring disclosure under N.D.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(Sambursky v. State, 2006 ND 223, 723 N.W.2d 524, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 2006).

        Where defendant failed to supply any competent evidence showing an issue of material fact under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1), his failure to appropriately respond to the State’s motion was fatal and the trial court’s dismissal of his motion for post-conviction relief was appropriate.

        Trial court did not err under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1) in granting the State’s motion to dismiss defendant’s application for postconviction relief where defendant presented no competent evidence to meet even a minimal burden of demonstrating a material fact issue as to juror misconduct.

        Where appellant was convicted of murdering two victims based in part by DNA evidence showing that blood from the one of victims was found on his blue jeans, additional DNA testing was not “materially relevant” under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-15(3)(b) to his claim of actual innocence. There was significant evidence tying appellant to the crime scene, including the testimony of witnesses who indicated that appellant planned to kill the victims and was seen at their home shortly before the fire; therefore, he failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary dismissal of his application for post-conviction relief under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1).

        When the state failed to make at least a cursory review of the record, and did not point out to the trial court how petitioner’s allegations were unsupported by the record, it failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact, and the trial court’s summary disposition of petitioner’s petition for post-conviction relief was reversed.

        The Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable to actions under the post-conviction relief act and, since matters outside the pleadings were raised by the State in its motion to dismiss petitioner’s motion for post-conviction relief, the rule governing summary judgment motions was applicable. Because petitioner was not given 30 days in which to respond to the State’s brief as required by N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 56(c), the trial court’s judgment dismissing the inmate’s application for post-conviction relief pursuant to N.D.C.C. § § 29-32.1-06(2) and 29-32.1-09 was reversed.

        District court improperly granted summary dismissal, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1), of a postconviction relief petitioner’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI, which claim was made on the ground that petitioner’s attorney did not inform petitioner that he would be required, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-9.1, to serve 85 percent of his sentence, because petitioner raised issues of fact and was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and as to whether petitioner suffered prejudice therefrom.

       <p>
        Denial of postconviction relief was improper because the district court erred in reading defendant’s sex offender treatment program condition to apply while he was incarcerated, rather than when he was released on probation, when the plain language of defendant’s probationary condition did not require attendance, participation, cooperation, or completion of a sex offender treatment program while defendant was incarcerated.

        District court erred in summarily dismissing defendant’s application for post-conviction relief because under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09, only a party could move for summary disposition, which could be granted only after it carried its initial burden of showing there was no genuine issue of material fact.

        Post-conviction relief application was improperly dismissed on a trial court’s own motion under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-06(2) because it was not impossible for an applicant to prove a claim upon which relief could have been granted; ineffectiveness of trial counsel was a ground for granting relief that generally could not have been summarily decided. Although the trial court had the inherent authority to summarily dismiss an application on its own initiative, there had to be no dispute as to the material facts or the inferences to be drawn from the undisputed facts before a dismissal could have been entered pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09; the trial court did not comply with the requirements of N.D.R.Civ.P. 56 and N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1) because the applicant was not given notice and an opportunity to respond and submit evidence before dismissal.

        Supreme Court of North Dakota held that post-conviction relief under N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1 was not available in municipal courts in North Dakota, because municipal courts were not courts of record under N.D.C.C. § 27-01-01 and N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1 refers to the record below in N.D.C.C. §§ 29-32.1-04(2), 29-32.1-10(1), (2). If an appeal from municipal court directly to the Supreme Court was proper, review would be impossible because of the lack of a record; therefore, the municipal court judgment denying petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief was void.

        Although the district court did not explicitly state its decision denying petitioner’s motion for postconviction relief was based on evidence presented at the evidentiary hearing, it issued its order five days after the hearing, and it was reasonable to infer that the district court’s decision was the result of the evidentiary hearing. Cue v. State, 2003 ND 97, 663 N.W.2d 637, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Procedure used in this case was tantamount to an evidentiary hearing based solely on a review of documents, including the transcript where the parties had indicated they had no other evidence to produce than what already existed in the court’s file and no purpose would have been served by scheduling an evidentiary hearing for the court to formally receive uncontested evidence accompanying the application for post-conviction relief.

       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner's claim that the district court failed to cite the basis of its decision was rejected where it was reasonable to infer based on the findings made that the decision was based on the transcript and the additional evidence offered by petitioner in the postconviction process.

       <p>
        District court properly dismissed an application for postconviction relief where although the order was devoid of reasoning as to why the State's summary judgment motion was granted, the prior proceedings, including appeals, involved essentially the same issues raised in the instant petition, the State had submitted the motion based on misuse of process and untimeliness at the court's invitation, and petitioner had not responded to the motion.

        Where district court issued an order addressing “various facets” of appellant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the appellate court noted that it did not encourage such a “minimalist” approach. It did, however, conclude that the failure to make more explicit findings and conclusions was harmless error.

        Defendant’s second petition for postconviction relief was properly denied, even though the order denying such was succinct, where judicial notice was taken of a prior petition; moreover, the trial court stated that the issues raised in the second petition had been previously considered. A legal conclusion dealing with res judicata was overly broad, but the remaining claims were appropriately denied on the ground of misuse of process and failure to show ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel.
   Steen v. State, 2007 ND 123, 736 N.W.2d 457, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2007).

        District court reached the correct result applying the doctrine of res judicata prior to the State responding, but for the wrong reason, because when the district court used the term “res judicata,” it should have referred to the authority granted under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1), rather than the affirmative defense statute; § 29-32.1-09(1), expressly allows the district court to consider whether an application for relief is successive, and upon determining it is, to summarily dismiss. Atkins v. State, 2021 ND 83, 959 N.W.2d 588, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 2021).

        As the study of false confessions was not a new science, without deciding whether information constituted newly discovered evidence, the supreme court concluded that the inmate inexcusably failed to raise claims of newly discovered evidence in his previous applications for postconviction relief, and they were barred as a misuse of the postconviction process. Froistad v. State, 2021 ND 92, 959 N.W.2d 863, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 2021).

       <p>
        District court erred in denying defendant’s application for post-conviction relief as procedurally barred based on the doctrines of misuse of process and res judicata because, while defendant received notice of the State’s motion to dismiss, he was not afforded time to reply, and, consequently, could not show good cause for noncompliance. Atkins v. State, 2019 ND 146, 928 N.W.2d 438, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should not be brought on direct appeal, but rather through a post-conviction relief proceeding, which allows the parties to fully develop a record on the issue of counsel’s performance and its impact on the defendant’s case. Therefore, where defendant first raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal of his conviction and trial court summarily affirmed the conviction without expressly denying the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the denial was without prejudice and defendant could raise the issue in post-conviction proceedings affording the possibility of an evidentiary hearing on the issue. DeCoteau v. State, 1998 ND 199, 586 N.W.2d 156, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The district court erred in finding to be res judicata the issues of failure of defense counsel to properly investigate and present the case to the jury and his failure to raise and protect issues that were his duty to raise and protect, inasmuch as those issues were not raised in the defendant’s direct appeal claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. Wilson v. State, 1999 ND 222, 603 N.W.2d 47, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where none of the issues raised by the defendant in his applications for post-conviction relief were issues which could not have been raised in his first motion to withdraw his guilty plea, he was not prejudiced by his counsel’s arguing inconsistently on the third application that defendant was not informed of the mandatory minimum instead of maximum sentence, given that his application would still have been dismissed on the grounds of misuse of process since the defendant had inexcusably failed to raise all his claims under this rule in his first motion.
   Berlin v. State, 2000 ND 206, 619 N.W.2d 623, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a genuine issue of material fact existed, the trial court should not have granted N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09 summary disposition to the State on defendant’s second application for post-conviction relief upon determining that res judicata under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-12(1) and misuse of process under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-12(2) barred defendant’s right to relief. The genuine issue of material fact that defendant raised was that certain issues, including the State’s alleged violation of N.D.R.Ev. 609(a)(1) by admitting evidence of prior instances of defendant committing domestic violence, were not pursued earlier because post-conviction counsel did not develop the evidentiary record, and that issue had to be considered in an evidentiary hearing.
   Coppage v. State, 2011 ND 227, 807 N.W.2d 585, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 231</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which petitioner appealed from an order denying his second application for postconviction relief, the Supreme Court directed the district court to address the merits of petitioner’s claims of denial of the right to counsel and of ineffective assistance of trial counsel because, under the law of the case doctrine, the Supreme Court’s previous decision allowed petitioner to raise these issues in a second postconviction proceeding. Baatz v. State, 2013 ND 172, 837 N.W.2d 387, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly dismissed defendant's application for postconviction relief because he did not establish that his trial counsel was ineffective where counsel could not be held responsible for something of which he had no knowledge, his chances of prevailing on a severance motion were slim where the codefendants did not testify against defendant, defendant's argument about the jury receiving an audio recording that was not received in evidence was determined in a previous proceeding, defendant did not identify what an objection to a jury instruction should have been or how it misstated the law, and the State only promised to forego the pursuit of habitual offender status if defendant entered into a written plea agreement. Ratliff v. State, 2016 ND 149, 882 N.W.2d 716, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        Finding that postconviction petitioner did not meet Strickland’s first prong as to an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim was error as the purposeful waiver of an argument on direct appeal in order to raise it in a postconviction relief action was a misuse of process.

        Defendant was precluded from raising issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in a second application for post-conviction relief where the defendant did not raise the issue in his first appeal.

       <p>
        Defendant who, in his first petition for post-conviction relief, inexcusably failed to raise issues concerning the trial court’s acceptance of his guilty plea, his right to be heard at sentencing, and violation of his plea agreement, but raised them in his second petition misused the post-conviction process. Silvesan v. State, 1999 ND 62, 591 N.W.2d 131, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Where the defendant failed to raise his claims in his initial post-conviction application, and chose instead to raise them in his second application, his claims were barred by the statutes’ affirmative defenses.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although the State’s notice of defendant’s status as a special dangerous offender was filed only 20 days before trial, defendant made no showing of prejudice and defendant did not raise the issue on direct appeal or in defendant’s previous applications for post-conviction relief; defendant’s failure to raise the issue until a subsequent post-conviction action was an abuse of process. Greybull v. State, 2004 ND 116, 680 N.W.2d 254, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s claim that the district court erred in holding a conference in his absence was barred because he failed to raise the issue on direct appeal, and the conference did not fall under one of the phases requiring him to be present; trial counsel’s performance concerning the hearing was not deficient given his testimony that there was inadequate time to contact petitioner and the fact that he communicated the facts to petitioner and was forced to act quickly because trial was scheduled for the next day. Kinsella v. State, 2013 ND 238, 840 N.W.2d 625, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner was not barred by res judicata from raising an in a post-conviction relief application because the issue was not determined in his motion to correct an illegal sentence; petitioner could not collaterally attack the conviction in the proceeding on his motion. Keller v. State, 2015 ND 228, 869 N.W.2d 424, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner's raising arguments in a post-conviction relief application did not qualify as a misuse of process because it involved new interpretations of law that were not adopted at the time petitioner was convicted or when he could have previously applied for post-conviction relief. Keller v. State, 2015 ND 228, 869 N.W.2d 424, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        District court did not err in summarily dismissing defendant’s November 2018 application for post-conviction relief regarding the February and August 2012 hotel receipts as defendant was aware of the receipts and had complete access to the receipts before trial; he could have raised that issue at trial or at the very latest, in his April 2017 application for post-conviction relief; and those receipts, which defendant argued would impeach the victim’s testimony, would not likely result in an acquittal.

        Issues which were considered and decided in the first appeal from conviction would not be considered further, and defendant’s variations on the same themes decided before did not merit post-conviction relief.

        Where, in his direct appeal, the defendant raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel with regard to a sleeping juror, that issue was fully and finally determined, and there was no error in the district court’s denial of his request for post-conviction relief on that issue. Wilson v. State, 1999 ND 222, 603 N.W.2d 47, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Defendant misused the post-conviction process in his third post-conviction relief application because the issues he identified as grounds for relief could have been raised in his previous petitions; therefore, they were barred as res judicata.

       <p>
        Issues, or variation of issues, raised by defendant in his second action for post-conviction relief were either fully and finally determined in previous proceedings and were res judicata, or constituted a misuse of process, because defendant offered no excuse or justification for failing to raise those claims in prior proceedings; thus, the dismissal of his application, and the trial court’s decision denying the appointment of post-conviction counsel was proper since his application was entirely without merit.

        Defendant, convicted of murder and filing a second application for post-conviction relief, was not entitled to relief on defendant’s claims of evidentiary error, ineffective assistance of trial counsel, and prosecutorial misconduct, as those claims were barred either due to res judicata under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-12(1) or misuse of process pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-12(2). As a result, dismissal of those claims could be summarily affirmed under N.D.R.App.P. 35.1(a)(7), although summary affirmance would not be proper on defendant’s ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel claim because defendant had stated facts regarding it that might entitle defendant to relief.

   Owens v. State, 2001 ND 15, 621 N.W.2d 566, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 17</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1057, 121 S. Ct. 2204, 149 L. Ed. 2d 1034, 2001 U.S. LEXIS 4094 (U.S. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly dismissed the petitioner’s application for post-conviction release when he failed to show an excuse for not presenting seven of his claims for relief in the proceeding leading to the conviction. Steinbach v. State, 2003 ND 46, 658 N.W.2d 355, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       <p>
        Where defendant did not raise the issue of prosecutorial misconduct on his prior direct appeal and failed to make any showing of excuse or justification for his failure to raise the issue, the supreme court found that his attempt to raise the issue at a belated date constituted misuse of process under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-12(2)(a), and that it would not address the issue on appeal.
   Laib v. State, 2005 ND 187, 705 N.W.2d 845, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claims of a denial of a speedy trial, a violation of double jeopardy, and imprisonment for failing to pay a debt all could have been raised in a direct appeal; therefore, postconviction relief was properly denied based on a misuse of process.
   Noorlun v. State, 2007 ND 118, 736 N.W.2d 477, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       <p>
        Although petitioner’s post-conviction relief claim could be construed as misuse of process under N.D.C.C. 29-32.1-12 because petitioner failed to pursue the alleged unlawful revocation of probation on direct appeal from the order revoking his probation, because petitioner’s response to the State’s motion to dismiss his petition for post-conviction relief asserted his claim was not barred by either res judicata or misuse of process, affirmative defenses listed in N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-12(3), and the State did not address this assertion at the district court, nor did the State address this issue on appeal, the State’s failure to plead this defense required the court to review the merits of petitioner’s appeal. Voisine v. State, 2008 ND 91, 748 N.W.2d 429, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, in his direct appeal, argued prosecutorial misconduct relating to the prosecutor’s comments during its closing argument, and his claims of prosecutorial misconduct relating to the prosecutor intentionally lying, misleading the court and jury, and suborning perjury also could have been raised in his direct appeal, and defendant did not provide any reason why he did not raise them then; defendant’s present attempt to raise claims of prosecutorial misconduct, after failing to pursue those claims in his direct appeal, constituted a misuse of process.
   Everett v. State, 2008 ND 199, 757 N.W.2d 530, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 222</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly summarily dismissed defendant's second application for postconviction relief because his application was a misuse of process inasmuch as neither miscommunication with counsel nor misunderstanding of the legal process excused defendant's failure to include his illegal sentence claim in his first application to the district court, and defendant asserted no newly discovered evidence that could not have been raised in the earlier application.
   Myers v. State, 2017 ND 66, 891 N.W.2d 724, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error to summarily deny an inmate’s subsequent post-conviction relief application for misuse of process because the inmate was not given required notice or an opportunity to show the application raised genuine issues of material fact, and it could not be concluded the trial court’s error did not prejudice the inmate as the court did not address the inmate’s argument that DNA analysis results withheld from the inmate would have been material to the inmate’s decision to plead guilty rather than proceed to trial. Gonzalez v. State, 2019 ND 47, 923 N.W.2d 143, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief because (1) defendant’s motions were properly considered as post-conviction claims barred by res judicata and misuse of process, and (2) defendant’s previously raised ineffective assistance claims were also barred by res judicata and misuse of process. State v. Atkins, 2019 ND 145, 928 N.W.2d 441, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 2019).

      If an application is denied, the state may move for an order requiring the applicant to reimburse the state for costs and for litigation expenses paid for the applicant from public funds. The court may grant the motion if it finds that the applicant’s claim is so completely lacking in factual support or legal basis as to be frivolous or that the applicant has deliberately misused process. The court may require reimbursement of costs and expenses only to the extent reasonable in light of the applicant’s present and probable future financial resources.

       <p>
        Although the county court issued an order denying a petition for post-conviction relief, where it was clear from the circumstances that the court intended the order to have the effect of a final judgment, the supreme court would treat the appeal as an appeal from the final judgment. Kaiser v. State, 417 N.W.2d 175, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 457</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        The current law governing post-conviction procedure does not contain a provision which provides that certain orders are equivalent to a final judgment. Kaiser v. State, 417 N.W.2d 175, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 457</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        An order granting a new trial to a post-conviction relief petitioner is a final judgment entered under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act, and thus appealable, given that no further post-conviction relief proceedings will occur after such an order except for a new criminal trial.
   Hill v. State, 2000 ND 143, 615 N.W.2d 135, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 2000).

        Supreme Court of North Dakota lacked jurisdiction over a municipal court judgment denying petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief, because the appeal was not authorized by statute.

        The appeal provisions of former chapter 29-32 were a cumulative, and not a superseding, remedy, and the right of the people to invoke the original jurisdiction of the supreme court in habeas corpus was still viable. Thus, an unsuccessful applicant for post-conviction relief could seek appellate review pursuant to former section 29-32-09 or could petition the supreme court for an original writ of habeas corpus.

       <p>
        In an appeal from a judgment under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act, the supreme court applies the “clearly erroneous” standard of N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 52(a), in reviewing fact questions. Rule 52(a) is inapplicable in original habeas corpus proceedings, and the supreme court reviews the record de novo. Thus, the court’s review of fact issues is more liberal under its original habeas corpus jurisdiction than it would be in an appeal under the uniform act. Jensen v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        As the statutory language of
   N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-15(3)(b) is similar to language adopted in Illinois under 725 ILCS 5/116-3, the Supreme Court of North Dakota has applied Illinois law in determining that evidence that is “materially relevant” to a defendant’s claim of actual innocence is evidence which tends to significantly advance that claim. In deciding whether evidence is “materially relevant,” a court must consider the exculpatory potential of a favorable DNA result, in addition to the other evidence presented at trial.

        Where appellant was convicted of murdering two victims based in part by DNA evidence showing that blood from the one of victims was found on his blue jeans, additional DNA testing was not “materially relevant” under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-15(3)(b) to his claim of actual innocence. There was significant evidence tying appellant to the crime scene, including the testimony of witnesses who indicated that appellant planned to kill the victims and was seen at their home shortly before the fire; appellant also testified at trial that one of the victim’s blood was found on his pants.

       </h5>
       <p>
        When a petitioner for postconviction relief sought DNA testing of evidence 30 years after his conviction, the clerk of court’s testimony regarding the existing evidence was sufficient to establish a prima facie case under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-15(2)(b), but the petitioner was unable to show that the remaining evidence for which he requested testing, apart from its having been received at trial, was subject to a sufficient chain of custody or was even still in existence. The supreme court concluded the petitioner did not establish a prima facie case under N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-15(2)(b).

        When a felony complaint is filed against an inmate, the trigger for the ninety-day period is when the prosecuting official and the court in which the untried complaint is filed receive the inmate’s request for disposition of the detainer.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant’s actions in delaying hearings for additional preparation time and for availability of out-of-state witnesses, and in requesting meetings with BCI agents on an unrelated matter, contributed substantially to the criminal charges not being brought to trial within 90 days. State v. Fulks, 1997 ND 143, 566 N.W.2d 418, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Factors to be considered in determining if the extension or continuance of the trial beyond the ninety-day time period constitutes good cause include: length of delay; reason for delay; defendant’s assertion of his right; and prejudice to the defendant. State v. Kania, 341 N.W.2d 361, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 419</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Good cause existed for justifying trial court’s order extending or continuing the trial beyond the ninety-day limitation period where, pursuant to defendant’s request, he was returned to the penitentiary, 200 miles away, denying immediate access, which did not militate in favor of an early trial; defendant expressed dissatisfaction with appointed counsel creating the need for appointment of new counsel; and defendant’s displeasure with the judge, causing the judge to recuse himself, resulted in the reassignment of the case to a new judge whose schedule was such that the matter could not be tried promptly. State v. Kania, 341 N.W.2d 361, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 419</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The substitution of defendant’s attorney the day before trial was to begin, the court’s full schedule and an approaching state holiday combined to warrant postponement of defendant’s trial. State v. Foster, 1997 ND 8, 560 N.W.2d 194, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-33-03 of the North Dakota Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 29-33, the combination of the unavailability of the state’s crime lab witness and the withdrawal of defense counsel shortly before the scheduled trial due to a conflict of interest was sufficient to constitute good cause for the delay.
   State v. Hinojosa, 2011 ND 116, 798 N.W.2d 634, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in finding good cause and extending the deadlines under the statute because it did not address whether the continuance satisfied the requirements of an administrative order that suspended criminal jury trials from March through July 1, 2020; any good cause determination was untimely, and, under the statute all the district court could do was dismiss the charges for lack of jurisdiction to continue their prosecution unless the 90-day period was tolled. State v. Lafromboise, 2021 ND 80, 959 N.W.2d 596, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2021).

       <p>
        Absent a statute or rule to the contrary, a written order of the court granting a continuance is entered and effective when it is signed by the judge; filing of the order by the clerk is not a prerequisite.

        Under the statute extension or trial was required before July 12, 2020, but the State did not seek a continuance or attempt to schedule the trial before July 12, 2020, or did the district court grant a continuance based on good cause before July 12, 2021; therefore, the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act was not complied with and dismissal of the charges with prejudice was required unless the 90-day period was tolled. State v. Lafromboise, 2021 ND 80, 959 N.W.2d 596, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err by granting the State additional time to schedule a trial and denying defendant’s motion to dismiss because an administrative order stated that the period from March 16, 2020 to July 1, 2020 would be deducted by the district court; that language dispensed with the district court’s need to make any further findings about the 90-day period because, after the June 16, 2020 continuance, the 90-day period was tolled as a matter of law. State v. Lafromboise, 2021 ND 80, 959 N.W.2d 596, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2021).

         Prejudice to Defendant.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant did not show he was prejudiced by the delay of his trial, where he was already incarcerated in the state penitentiary when he requested disposition of his detainer and was incarcerated on the date of his trial, he did not claim “anxiety and concern” because of the delay, nor was there any evidence of impaired defense. State v. Foster, 1997 ND 8, 560 N.W.2d 194, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order granting the State’s motion for additional time to bring defendant’s case to trial was upheld where defendant was not prejudiced by the delay because he was already incarcerated on another charge; the trial court’s oral ruling finding good cause was a final order that properly granted the State’s motion for additional time.

       <p>
        The defendant’s statutory right to a speedy trial was violated where his trial date was three days after the expiration of the court’s continuance order. State v. Olsen, 540 N.W.2d 149, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-33-03 of the North Dakota Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 29-33, because the first rescheduled trial date before defendant consented to further continuances was approximately 54 days beyond the 90-day limit, the delay was not excessive given the severity of the class AA felony charge facing defendant.
   State v. Hinojosa, 2011 ND 116, 798 N.W.2d 634, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly rejected defendant's claim that the State violated his right to a speedy trial because, while the district court scheduled a trial 96 days after defendant submitted his request to the Department of Corrections and 82 days after the district court and State's attorney had each received it, the 90-day period began when the district court and the State's attorney received defendant's request for a speedy trial and charges were statutorily required to be dismissed if not brought to trial within 90 days after the receipt of the request and certificate by the court and prosecuting official.

        ARTICLE I
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

        Where a prisoner made a prima facie showing that his delay in arriving at a federal correctional institution, allegedly caused by a detainer and written request for temporary custody issued by the state, prejudiced him and had an adverse impact on his rehabilitation program and his qualifications for extra good time credits, the State, in order to prevail in arguing that this Act was inapplicable while the prisoner was housed by the state, was required to establish that the prisoner would have remained at the state facility under the control of federal authorities regardless of the existence of the detainer and pending state charges.

       <p>
        Commencement of 180 day period under Interstate Agreement of Detainers was not triggered where defendant served request for speedy disposition on out of state warden and warden never forwarded the request to officials of this state. State v. Moe, 1998 ND 137, 581 N.W.2d 468, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1998).

         Detainer.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A detainer is simply a notification filed with the institution in which a prisoner is serving a sentence, advising that he is wanted to face pending criminal charges in another jurisdiction. Runck v. State, 497 N.W.2d 74, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum and accompanying affidavits constituted both a detainer and a written request for temporary custody within the meaning of this section where the documents accompanying the writ sufficiently notified the federal authorities that the prisoner was wanted to face pending criminal charges in North Dakota, where a complaint was in existence at the time, and where the affidavit of the prosecutor informed federal authorities that the prisoner would be charged with felony criminal offenses in North Dakota. Runck v. State, 497 N.W.2d 74, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s request for speedy disposition of detainer under N.D.C.C. § 29-33-01 did not invoke the provisions of this section because defendant’s request did not contain a certificate from the warden of the institution where he was incarcerated as required under Article III, § 1. State v. Moe, 1998 ND 137, 581 N.W.2d 468, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1998).

        This Act is intended to minimize uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation caused by the existence of outstanding charges against a prisoner and detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints in other jurisdictions. Runck v. State, 497 N.W.2d 74, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        The purpose of this Act is to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of outstanding charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. Runck v. State, 497 N.W.2d 74, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A prisoner did not waive his right to complain of a violation of this Act by entering into a contingent guilty plea. Runck v. State, 497 N.W.2d 74, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant stated he wished to plead guilty in order to accept responsibility for his actions and to do so early on in order to take advantage of a concurrent sentence and dismissal of other charges, the objective facts clearly demonstrated that defendant’s plea was knowing and voluntary, and therefore, constituted a waiver of alleged Detainers Act violations.
