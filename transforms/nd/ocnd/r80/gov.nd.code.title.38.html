     </h3>
     <p>
      A surface coal mining operator may petition the board of county commissioners to temporarily close or relocate a section line road or other road if the road interferes with the operator’s conduct of surface coal mining operations. The board of county commissioners, if so petitioned, may, after notice and public hearing, temporarily close or relocate the section line road or other road, providing the road is not required due to readily accessible alternate routes of travel and the closing or relocation does not deprive adjacent landowners access to their property. If a road is closed as provided for in this section, the board of county commissioners may require that after completion of surface coal mining operations the operator restore the road to as good a condition as existed prior to the closing of the road.

     <p>
      If the locator of any mining claim, or the locator’s assigns, shall apprehend that the original certificate was defective, erroneous, or that the requirements of the law had not been complied with before filing, or is desirous of changing the locator’s surface boundaries, or of taking in any part of an overlapping claim which has been abandoned, such locator or the locator’s assigns may file an additional certificate subject to the provisions of this chapter. Such relocation may not interfere with the existing rights of others at the time of such relocation. No such relocation, nor the record thereof, may preclude the claimant from proving any such title as the claimant may have held under previous locations.

    Actions relating to disputed mining property — Surveys ordered — Regulations governing.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In an action in any district court of this state wherein the title or right of possession to any mining claim is in dispute, the court, upon the application of any of the parties to such suit, may enter an order for such survey of the underground as well as the surface of such part of the property in dispute as may be necessary to a just determination of the question involved. Such order must designate some competent surveyor who is not related to any of the parties to such suit and who is not interested in the result of the same. Upon the application of the party adverse to such application, the court may appoint some competent surveyor selected by such adverse applicant, who shall attend upon such survey and observe the method of making the same. Such second survey must be made at the cost of the party requesting it. Such order may specify the names of witnesses named by either party, not exceeding three on each side, to examine such property, and such witnesses may enter into such property and examine the same. The court may cause the removal of any rock, debris, or other obstacle in any of the drifts or shafts of such property when such removal is shown to be necessary to a just determination of the question involved. No order may be made for a survey and inspection except upon notice of the application for such order of at least six days, and not then except by an agreement of the parties or upon the affidavit of two or more persons that such survey and inspection are necessary to the just determination of the suit. Such affidavit must state the facts in the case and wherein the necessity for the survey exists. Such order may not be made unless it appears that the party asking for the same had been refused the privilege of survey and inspection by the adverse party.

        District court properly dismissed a nonparticipating cotenant's declaratory judgment action and claim for specific performance because the nonparticipating cotenant failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and could not establish that it was a third-party beneficiary of an assignment between the participating cotenant and the assignee inasmuch as the Industrial Commission had the ability to request any documents necessary from the assignee or the participating cotenant, their assignment clearly and explicitly declared there were no third-party beneficiaries, and the parol evidence rule precluded the nonparticipating cotenant from introducing extrinsic evidence to contradict the agreement.

        By enacting N.D.C.C. § 38-08-04(2), the North Dakota legislature intended that the North Dakota Industrial Commission would occupy the field of the regulation of oil and gas waste treatment plants and, therefore, has exclusive jurisdiction of the issue of the location of oil and gas waste treating plants.

        Where the commission’s decision is consistent with the norm of not injecting substances into producing formations, except, for example, in unit operation of secondary recovery efforts, the commission’s findings are adequate to support commission’s decision to deny working interest owner’s application to dispose of produced salt water by injecting into nearby nonproducing well.

       <p>
        Plaintiff, an oil company, filed application with state industrial commission seeking an exception to prescribed spacing pattern in connection with drilling a test well for oil and gas. The application was approved and drilling exception granted. Defendant corporation requested suspension of the order pending hearing de novo before the commission. The commission attached no conditions to granting of a hearing de novo but only required defendant to file a supersedeas bond which caused plaintiff to cease drilling operations. The defendant, who did not object to conditioning of order of suspension on filing of bond and who did not file bond under protest, could not contend that bond was not voluntary and binding although commission had no authority to require defendant to file the bond.

       <p>
        Since no provision is made by statutes or rules of state industrial commission for suspension of an order of commission pending a hearing de novo or a rehearing, no provision exists for fixing of a supersedeas bond upon application for suspension of a commission order.

       The person or company drilling or operating the well or equipment cannot be found, has no assets with which to properly plug or replug the well or reclaim the site, cannot be legally required to plug or replug the well or to reclaim the site, pipeline, or associated pipeline facility, or damage is the result of an illegal dumping incident.
      </li>

     <p>
      Sealed bids for any well plugging or reclamation work under this section must be solicited by placing a notice in the official county newspaper of the county in which the work is to be done and in such other newspapers of general circulation in the area as the commission may deem appropriate. Bids must be addressed to the commission and must be opened publicly at the time and place designated in the notice. The contract must be let to the lowest responsible bidder, but the commission may reject any or all bids submitted. If a well or equipment is leaking or likely to leak oil, gas, or saltwater or is likely to cause a serious threat of pollution or injury to the public health or safety, the commission, without notice or the letting of bids, may enter into contracts necessary to mitigate the problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      The contracts for the plugging or replugging of wells or the reclamation of well sites must be on terms and conditions as prescribed by the commission, but at a minimum the contracts shall require the plugging and reclamation to comply with all statutes and rules governing the plugging of wells and reclamation of sites.

      If the commission, its agents, employees, or contractors, plugs or replugs a well or reclaims a well site, pipeline facility, production facility, saltwater handling facility, or treating plant under the provisions of sections <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-04" target="_self">38-08-04.</a></cite>4, <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-04" target="_self">38-08-04.</a></cite>5, 38-08-04.7, 38-08-04.8, 38-08-04.9, and 38-08-04.10, the state has a cause of action for all reasonable expenses incurred in the plugging, replugging, or reclamation against the operator at the time the well is required to be plugged and the well or facility is required to be abandoned or any or all persons who own a working interest in the well, pipeline facility, production facility, saltwater handling facility, or treating plant at the time the well is required to be plugged and the well, pipeline facility, production facility, saltwater handling facility, or treating plant abandoned as a result of the ownership of a lease or mineral interest in the property on which the well, pipeline facility, production facility, saltwater handling facility, or treating plant is located. The term “working interest owner” does not mean a royalty owner or an overriding royalty interest owner. The commission shall seek reimbursement for all reasonable expenses incurred in plugging any well or reclaiming any well site, pipeline facility, production facility, saltwater handling facility, or treating plant through an action instituted by the attorney general. The liability of any working interest owner under this section shall be limited to that proportion of the reasonable expenses incurred by the commission that the interest of any such working interest owner bears to the entire working interest in the well. Any money collected in a suit under this section must be deposited in the state abandoned oil and gas well plugging and site reclamation fund. Any suit brought by the commission for reimbursement under this section may be brought in the district court for Burleigh County, the county in which the plugged well or reclaimed well site, pipeline facility, production facility, saltwater handling facility, or treating plant is located, or the county in which any defendant resides.

    Confiscation of equipment and salable oil to cover plugging and reclamation costs.

     <p>
      When the commission intends to exercise or has exercised its right to plug a well or reclaim a well site, pipeline facility, production facility, saltwater handling facility, or treating plant, the commission, as compensation for its costs, may confiscate any equipment and salable oil at the well site, pipeline facility, production facility, saltwater handling facility, or treating plant. The equipment subject to confiscation is limited to that owned by the operator, former operator, or working interest owner. If the commission exercises its authority under this section and there is salable oil at the well site, that oil must be confiscated. The commission shall pay the mineral owners the royalty interest in the oil confiscated at the well site. In determining the mineral owners and their royalty interests, the commission may rely upon the most recent division order it is able to obtain. If one is unavailable or the commission finds the order unreliable, the commission may rely upon any other source of information the commission deems reasonable to determine and pay mineral owners. A confiscation must be by an order of the commission after notice and hearing. A confiscation order transfers title to the commission.

       Whenever the commission limits the total amount of oil or gas which may be produced in the state or a marketing district, the commission shall allocate or distribute the allowable production among the pools therein on a reasonable basis, giving, where reasonable under the circumstances to each pool with small wells of settled production, an allowable production which prevents the general premature abandonment of such wells in the pool.

       Whenever the commission limits the total amount of oil or gas which may be produced in any pool in this state to an amount less than that amount which the pool could produce if no restriction was imposed, which limitation is imposed either incidental to, or without, a limitation of the total amount of oil or gas produced in the marketing district wherein the pool is located, the commission shall allocate or distribute the allowable production among the several wells or producing properties in the pool on a reasonable basis, preventing or minimizing reasonable avoidable drainage, so that each property will have the opportunity to produce or to receive its just and equitable share, subject to the reasonable necessities for the prevention of waste.

      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-06ol14">
       In allocating the market demand for gas as between pools within marketing districts, the commission shall give due regard to the fact that gas produced from oil pools is to be regulated in a manner as will protect the reasonable use of its energy for oil production.

       The commission is not required to determine the reasonable market demand applicable to any single pool, except in relation to all other pools within the same marketing district, and in relation to the demand applicable to the marketing district. In allocating allowables to pools, the commission may consider, but is not bound by, nominations of purchasers to purchase from particular fields, pools, or portions thereof.

       When necessary to prevent waste, to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells, or to protect correlative rights, the commission shall establish spacing units for a pool. Spacing units when established must be of uniform size and shape for the entire pool, except that when found to be necessary for any of the purposes above mentioned, the commission is authorized to divide any pool into zones and establish spacing units for each zone, which units may differ in size and shape from those established in any other zone.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-07ol12">

       An order establishing spacing units for a pool must specify the size and shape of each unit and the location of the permitted well thereon in accordance with a reasonably uniform spacing plan. Upon application, if the commission finds that a well drilled at the prescribed location would not produce in paying quantities, that surface conditions would substantially add to the burden or hazard of drilling such well, or that the drilling of such well at a location other than the prescribed location is otherwise necessary either to protect correlative rights, to prevent waste, or to effect greater ultimate recovery of oil and gas, the commission is authorized to enter an order permitting the well to be drilled at a location other than that prescribed by such spacing order; however, the commission shall include in the order suitable provisions to prevent the production from the spacing unit of more than its just and equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool.

       An order establishing units for a pool must cover all lands determined or believed to be underlaid by such pool, and may be modified by the commission from time to time to include additional areas determined to be underlaid by such pool. When found necessary for the prevention of waste, or to avoid the drilling of unnecessary wells, or to protect correlative rights, an order establishing spacing units in a pool may be modified by the commission to increase or decrease the size of spacing units in the pool or any zone thereof, or to permit the drilling of additional wells on a reasonably uniform plan in the pool, or any zone thereof, or an additional well on any spacing unit thereof.

        Property subject to a mineral lease in sections 14 and 15 could be used for operations on property within the spacing unit in sections 23 and 26 that were not subject to the lease, and the Supreme Court declined to add additional language to the lease. Under these circumstance, the district court correctly construed the lease to authorize an energy company to use the parts of sections 14 and 15 subject to the lease for operations within the pooled spacing unit but outside the lease.

        The commission’s authority to modify “an order establishing spacing units” by either downspacing or providing infill drilling is derived from this statute, and nothing in this statute limits its scope to only proper spacing orders as opposed to temporary spacing orders.

       <p>
        District court properly affirmed an Industrial Commission order granting a lessee's application to terminate existing oil and gas well spacing units, to create new spacing units, and to modify well setback requirements for portions of two spacing units because one lease specifically authorized the lessee to seek reunitization, the proposed spacing units and well configurations would prevent waste and the drilling of unnecessary wells, the surface owner did not have a right to a guaranteed share of production, the estimated reduction did not establish that the owner's correlative rights were violated, and appeals from administrative agency decisions could not be turned into inverse condemnation actions.

        The commission has the authority to divide a pool into geographic areas (i.e., zone a pool) for non-uniform spacing units when necessary to prevent waste, avoid drilling unnecessary wells, or to protect correlative rights. Hystad v. Industrial Comm'n, 389 N.W.2d 590, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 346</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        The existence of different stratigraphic intervals is not a statutory requirement for the commission to order different size or shape spacing units. The context of the language authorizes the commission to divide a pool into geographic zones. If a zone were interpreted as a stratigraphic interval, the commission would have the authority to divide a pool into stratigraphic intervals. However, a stratigraphic interval exists because of the geologic composition of the earth, and the commission cannot create a stratigraphic interval if it does not exist because of the earth’s geologic composition.

        When entering its initial proper spacing order, the commission may divide a pool into geographic zones, and establish different sized or shaped spacing units in each zone, including the drilling of additional wells within one zone on the spacing unit first established in a temporary spacing order. However, since the primary statutory requirement is units “of uniform size and shape for the entire pool”, the commission’s authority to establish zones with different unit provisions for one pool requires express findings that such a spacing order is necessary to prevent waste, to avoid drilling unnecessary wells, or to protect correlative rights. Hystad v. Industrial Comm'n, 389 N.W.2d 590, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 346</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a deviation from the standard of a uniform size unit is necessary to protect correlative rights, the commission must explain why the deviation is necessary within the context of the right of each owner to a just and equitable share of the common source of supply and the duty to other owners not to damage or take an undue proportion of oil or gas from that common source of supply. This is especially true because the physical characteristics and reservoir dynamics of a pool involve highly technical evidence. Hystad v. Industrial Comm'n, 389 N.W.2d 590, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 346</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        Since no provision is made by statutes or rules of state industrial commission for suspension of an order of commission pending a hearing de novo or a rehearing, no provision exists for fixing of a supersedeas bond upon application for suspension of a commission order.

       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff, an oil company, filed application with state industrial commission seeking an exception to prescribed spacing pattern in connection with drilling a test well for oil and gas. On approval of the application the drilling exception was granted. Defendant corporation requested suspension of the order pending hearing de novo before the commission. The commission attached no conditions to the granting of a hearing de novo but only required defendant to file a supersedeas bond which caused the plaintiff to cease drilling operations. The defendant, who made no objection to conditioning of order of suspension on filing of bond and who did not file bond under protest, could not contend that bond was not voluntary and binding although the commission had no authority to require defendant to file the bond.

       When two or more separately owned tracts are embraced within a spacing unit, or when there are separately owned interests in all or a part of the spacing unit, then the owners and royalty owners thereof may pool their interests for the development and operation of the spacing unit. In the absence of voluntary pooling, the commission upon the application of any interested person shall enter an order pooling all interests in the spacing unit for the development and operations thereof. Each such pooling order must be made after notice and hearing, and must be upon terms and conditions that are just and reasonable, and that afford to the owner of each tract or interest in the spacing unit the opportunity to recover or receive, without unnecessary expense, that owner’s just and equitable share. Operations incident to the drilling of a well upon any portion of a spacing unit covered by a pooling order must be deemed, for all purposes, the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the drilling unit by the several owners thereof. That portion of the production allocated to each tract included in a spacing unit covered by a pooling order must, when produced, be deemed for all purposes to have been produced from such tract by a well drilled thereon. For the purposes of this section and section 38-08-10, any unleased mineral interest pooled by virtue of this section before August 1, 2009, is entitled to a cost-free royalty interest equal to the acreage weighted average royalty interest of the leased tracts within the spacing unit, but in no event may the royalty interest of an unleased tract be less than a one-eighth interest. An unleased mineral interest pooled after July 31, 2009, is entitled to a cost-free royalty interest equal to the acreage weighted average royalty interest of the leased tracts within the spacing unit or, at the operator’s election, a cost-free royalty interest of sixteen percent. The remainder of the unleased interest must be treated as a lessee or cost-bearing interest.

      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-08ol12">
       Each such pooling order must make provision for the drilling and operation of a well on the spacing unit, and for the payment of the reasonable actual cost thereof by the owners of interests in the spacing unit, plus a reasonable charge for supervision. In the event of any dispute as to such costs, the commission shall determine the proper costs. If one or more of the owners shall drill and operate, or pay the expenses of drilling and operating the well for the benefit of others, then, the owner or owners so drilling or operating shall, upon complying with the terms of section 38-08-10, have a lien on the share of production from the spacing unit accruing to the interest of each of the other owners for the payment of the owner’s or owners’ proportionate share of such expenses. All the oil and gas subject to the lien must be marketed and sold and the proceeds applied in payment of the expenses secured by such lien as provided for in section 38-08-10.

       In addition to any costs and charges recoverable under subsections 1 and 2, if the owner of an interest in a spacing unit elects not to participate in the risk and cost of drilling a well thereon, the owner paying for the nonparticipating owner’s share of the drilling and operation of a well may recover from the nonparticipating owner a risk penalty for the risk involved in drilling the well. The recovery of a risk penalty is as follows:

        <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-08ol13a">
         If the nonparticipating owner’s interest in the spacing unit is derived from a lease or other contract for development, the risk penalty is two hundred percent of the nonparticipating owner’s share of the reasonable actual costs of drilling and completing the well and may be recovered out of, and only out of, production from the pooled spacing unit, as provided by section 38-08-10, exclusive of any royalty or overriding royalty.
        </li>
        <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-08ol13b">
         If the nonparticipating owner’s interest in the spacing unit is not subject to a lease or other contract for development, the risk penalty is fifty percent of the nonparticipating owner’s share of the reasonable actual costs of drilling and completing the well and may be recovered out of production from the pooled spacing unit, as provided by section 38-08-10, exclusive of any royalty provided for in subsection 1.

         The owner paying for the nonparticipating owner’s share of the drilling and operation of a well may recover from the nonparticipating owner a risk penalty for the risk involved in drilling and completing the well only if the paying owner has made an unsuccessful, good-faith attempt to have the unleased nonparticipating owner execute a lease or to have the leased nonparticipating owner join in and participate in the risk and cost of drilling the well. Before a risk penalty may be imposed, the paying owner must notify the nonparticipating owner with proof of service that the paying owner intends to impose a risk penalty and that the nonparticipating owner may object to the risk penalty by either responding in opposition to the petition for a risk penalty or if no such petition has been filed, by filing an application or request for hearing with the industrial commission.

        “Spacing unit”, as used in N.D.C.C. § 38-08-07 and 38-08-08 is synonymous with “drilling unit” as used in the fourth sentence of subsection 1 of this section; the sentence is applicable only where there are separately owned tracts and not separately owned interests in the same tract. Schank v. North Am. Royalties, 201 N.W.2d 419, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1972).

        Property subject to a mineral lease in sections 14 and 15 could be used for operations on property within the spacing unit in sections 23 and 26 that were not subject to the lease, and the Supreme Court declined to add additional language to the lease. Under these circumstance, the district court correctly construed the lease to authorize an energy company to use the parts of sections 14 and 15 subject to the lease for operations within the pooled spacing unit but outside the lease.

       <p>
        North Dakota Industrial Commission’s decision to impose a risk penalty under
   N.D.C.C. § 38-08-08 was not given deference because the findings of fact were not sufficient; the decision did not explain how the Commission reached the conclusion that a risk penalty could have been assessed due to an untimely acceptance of an invitation. Even if immaterial or insubstantial deviations from the administrative requirements that did not refer to estimations or approximations were allowable, there was no explanation why, in view of the changes made in a second letter, that a second owner’s 10 day tardiness in accepting the invitation and forwarding its share of the costs was not an equally immaterial and insubstantial deviation.
   Gadeco, LLC v. Indus. Comm'n of N.D., 2012 ND 33, 812 N.W.2d 405, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial and credible evidence supported the assessment of a 200 percent risk penalty against a nonparticipating owner under N.D.C.C. § 38-08-08(3)(a) because changes to an invitation to participate in a well, made by a subsequent letter, were insubstantial under N.D.C.C. § 31-11-05(24) and did not require that another invitation be issued. The invitation met the requirements of N.D. Admin. Code § 43-02-03-16.3(1)(a)(1), and timeliness in accepting a valid invitation is mandatory.

        District court erred in awarding damages to an oil company in it breach of contract action against a non-operating working interest owner and in dismissing the owner's counterclaims because, while a contract existed between the parties, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action when the oil company amended its complaint to abandon the lien foreclosure action and allege breach of contract against the owner, the owner's counterclaims were inextricably intertwined with the "reasonable actual cost" determination, and the parties had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before the industrial commission.

        A well of an owner of mineral and royalty interests in an oil field proposed to be made a unit under a voluntary unitization agreement cannot be designated as an injection well where the owner did not join in such unit agreement.

    Order — Units and unit areas — Plan of unitization.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The order of the commission must define the area of the common source of supply or portion thereof to be included within the unit area and prescribe with reasonable detail the plan of unitization applicable thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each unit and unit area must be limited to all or a portion of a single common source of supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      A unit may be created to embrace less than the whole of a common source of supply only where it is shown by the evidence that the area to be so included within the unit area is of such size and shape as may be reasonably required for the successful and efficient conduct of the unitized method or methods of operation for which the unit is created, and that the conduct thereof will have no material adverse effect upon the remainder of such common source of supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      The plan of unitization for each such unit and unit area must be one suited to the needs and requirements of the particular unit dependent upon the facts and conditions found to exist with respect thereto. In addition to such other terms, provisions, conditions, and requirements found by the commission to be reasonably necessary or proper to effectuate or accomplish the purposes of sections <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>1 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>16, and subject to the further requirements hereof, each such plan of unitization must contain fair, reasonable, and equitable provisions for:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-09.20ol11">
       The efficient unitized management or control of the further development and operation of the unit area for the recovery of oil and gas from the common source of supply affected. Under such a plan, the actual operations within the unit area may be carried on in whole or in part by the unit itself, or by one or more of the lessees within the unit area as unit operator subject to the supervision and direction of the unit, dependent upon what is most beneficial or expedient. The designation of the unit operator must be by a vote of the working interest owners in the unit in a manner provided by the plan of unitization and not by the commission, and the unit-operating agreement must contain a provision that the owners of a simple majority of the working interest in the unit area may vote to change the unit operator.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-09.20ol12">
       The division of interest or formula for the apportionment and allocation of the unit production, among and to the several separately owned tracts within the unit area such as will reasonably permit persons otherwise entitled to share in or benefit by the production from such separately owned tracts to produce or receive, in lieu thereof, their fair, equitable, and reasonable share of the unit production or other benefits thereof. A separately owned tract’s fair, equitable, and reasonable share of the unit production must be measured by the value of each such tract for oil and gas purposes and its contributing value to the unit in relation to like values of other tracts in the unit, taking into account acreage [hectarage], the quantity of oil and gas recoverable therefrom, location on structure, its probable productivity of oil and gas in the absence of unit operations, the burden of operation to which the tract will or is likely to be subjected, or so many of said factors, or such other pertinent engineering, geological, or operating factors, as may be reasonably susceptible of determination. Unit production as that term is used in sections 38-08-09.1 through 38-08-09.16 means and includes all oil and gas produced from a unit area from and after the effective date of the order of the commission creating the unit regardless of the well or tract within the unit area from which the same is produced.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-09.20ol13">
       The manner in which the unit and the further development and operation of the unit area shall or may be financed and the basis, terms, and conditions on which the cost and expense thereof shall be apportioned among and assessed against the tracts and interests made chargeable therewith, including a detailed accounting procedure governing all charges and credits incident to such operations. Upon and subject to such terms and conditions as to time and legal rate of interest as may be fair to all concerned, reasonable provision must be made in the plan of unitization for carrying or otherwise financing owners who are unable to promptly meet their financial obligations in connection with the unit and, in addition to the unit expense assessed against each tract and chargeable to each owner, the recovery of a risk penalty from each owner electing not to participate in the unit expense. The recovery of the risk penalty is as follows:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-09.20ol13a">
         If the nonparticipating owner’s interest in the unit is derived from a lease or other contract for development, the risk penalty is two hundred percent of the nonparticipating owner’s share of the unit expense and may be recovered out of, and only out of, production from the unit, exclusive of any royalty or overriding royalty.
        </li>
        <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-09.20ol13b">
         If the nonparticipating owner’s interest in the unit is not subject to a lease or other contract for development, the penalty is fifty percent of the nonparticipating owner’s share of the unit expense and may be recovered out of production from the unit exclusive of any royalty provided for in section 38-08-09.13.
        </li>
        <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-09.20ol13c">
         The owner paying for the nonparticipating owner’s share of the unit expense may recover from the nonparticipating owner a risk penalty for the risk involved in the unit expense only if the paying owner has made an unsuccessful, good-faith attempt to have the unleased nonparticipating owner execute a lease or to have the leased nonparticipating owner join in and participate in the risk of the unit expense. Before a risk penalty may be imposed, the paying owner must notify the nonparticipating owner with proof of service that the paying owner intends to impose a risk penalty and that the nonparticipating owner may object to the risk penalty by either responding in opposition to the petition for a risk penalty or if no such petition has been filed, by filing an application or request for hearing with the industrial commission.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-09.20ol14">
       The procedure and basis upon which wells, equipment, and other properties of the several lessees within the unit area are to be taken over and used for unit operations, including the method of arriving at the compensation therefor, or of otherwise proportionately equalizing or adjusting the investment of the several lessees in the project as of the effective date of unit operation.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-09.20ol15">
       The creation of an operating committee to have general overall management and control of the unit and the conduct of its business and affairs and the operations carried on by it, together with the creation or designation of such other subcommittees, boards, or officers to function under authority of the operating committee as may be necessary, proper, or convenient in the efficient management of the unit, defining the powers and duties of all such committees, boards, or officers and prescribing their tenure and time and method for their selection.

       The time when and conditions under which and the method by which the unit must or may be dissolved and its affairs wound up; however, the unit may be dissolved ten years after the unit agreement becomes effective upon a petition to the commission by the royalty owners who are credited with at least the percentage of interest of the royalty production and proceeds thereof required to ratify the unit agreement on the date the unit agreement was initially approved by the commission, and a subsequent hearing and order by the commission. The commission may not dissolve any unit if the dissolution would be likely to result in waste or the violation of the correlative rights of any owner.

     <p>
      At the time of filing of the petition for the approval of a unit agreement and the filing of the unit agreement, the commission shall schedule a hearing. At least forty-five days prior to the hearing, the applicant shall give notice of the hearing and shall mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the application and the proposed plan of unitization to each affected person owning an interest of record in the unit outline, at such person’s last-known post-office address. In addition, the applicant shall file with the commission engineering, geological, and all other technical exhibits to be used at the hearing, and further, the notice must specify that such material is filed and is available for inspection. Service is complete in the mailing of the notice of hearing and unit agreement to each interest owner as described in this section and the filing of an affidavit of mailing with the commission. No order of the commission creating a unit and prescribing its plan of unitization becomes effective until the plan of unitization has been signed, or in writing ratified or approved by those persons who, under the commission’s order, will be required to pay more than fifty-five percent of the costs of the unit operation and by the owners of more than fifty-five percent of the royalty interests, excluding overriding royalties, production payments, and other interests carved out of the working interest, and in addition it is required that when there is more than one person who will be obligated to pay costs of the unit operation, at least two nonaffiliated such persons and at least two royalty interest owners, are required as voluntary parties, and the commission has made a finding either in the order creating the unit or in a supplemental order that the plan of unitization has been so signed, ratified, or approved by lessees and royalty owners owning the required percentage interest. If the plan of unitization has not been signed, ratified, or approved by lessees and royalty owners owning the required percentage interest at the time the order creating the unit is made, the commission shall, upon petition and notice, hold such additional hearings as may be requested or required to determine if and when the plan of unitization has been so signed, ratified, or approved by lessees and royalty owners owning the required percentage interest and shall, in respect to such hearings, enter a finding of its determination in such regard. In the event lessees and royalty owners, or either, owning the required percentage interest have not signed, ratified, or approved the plan of unitization within six months from the date on which the order creating the unit is made, the order ceases to be of further force and effect and shall be revoked by the commission.

      The obligation or liability of the lessee or other owners of the oil and gas rights in the several separately owned tracts for the payment of unit expense is at all times several and not joint or collective and in no event may a lessee or other owner of the oil and gas rights in the separately owned tract be chargeable with, obligated or liable, directly or indirectly, for more than the amount apportioned, assessed, or otherwise charged to that person’s interest in such separately owned tract pursuant to the plan of unitization and then only to the extent of the lien provided for within sections <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>1 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>16.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any nonsigning working interest owner may withdraw from the unit to which that person’s interest is committed by transferring, without warranty of title, either express or implied, to the unit operator on the behalf of the other working interest owners, all of that person’s working interest in all unit equipment and in all wells used in unit operations. The instrument of transfer must be delivered to the unit operator. Such transfer relieves the withdrawing working interest owner from any liability for unit operations except any incurred pursuant to sections <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>1 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>16. The interest so transferred is owned by the other working interest owners in proportion to their respective participation in the unit. The unit operator, on the behalf of the other working interest owners, in proportion to their respective interests so acquired, shall pay the transferor for the transferor’s interest in unit equipment and wells the net salvage value thereof as determined by agreement between the transferor and the unit operator. In the event such net salvage value is not agreed upon within sixty days after such transfer, then either party may request a hearing of the matter before the commission, and, after notice and hearing, the commission shall determine such value.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to such reasonable limitations as may be set out in the plan of unitization, the unit has a first and prior lien upon the leasehold production (exclusive of such interests which are free of costs, such as royalties, overriding royalties, and production payments) in and to each separately owned tract, the interest of the owners thereof in and to the unit production in the possession of the unit, to secure the payment of the amount of the unit expense charged to and assessed against such separately owned tract. The interest of the lessee or other persons who by lease, contract, or otherwise are obligated or responsible for the cost and expense of developing and operating a separately owned tract for oil and gas in the absence of unitization, must, however, be primarily responsible for and charged with any assessment for unit expense made against such tract. Any landowner royalty or any overriding royalty, or any production payment which is a part of the unit production allocated to each separately owned tract must in all events be regarded as royalty to be distributed to and among, or the proceeds thereof paid to the royalty owners free and clear of all unit expense and free of any lien thereof.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Property rights, leases, contracts, and all other rights and obligations must be regarded as amended and modified to the extent necessary to conform to the provisions and requirements of sections <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>1 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>16 and to any valid and applicable plan of unitization or order of the commission made and adopted pursuant hereto, but otherwise to remain in full force and effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in sections <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>1 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>16 may be construed to require a transfer to or vesting in the unit of title to the separately owned tracts or leases thereon within the unit area, other than the right to use and operate the same to the extent set out in the plan of unitization; nor may the unit be regarded as owning the unit production. The unit production and the proceeds from the sale thereof are owned by the several persons to whom the same is allocated under the plan of unitization. All property, whether real or personal, which the unit may in any way acquire, hold, or possess may not be acquired, held, or possessed by the unit for its own account but must be so acquired, held, and possessed by the unit for the account and as agent of the several lessees and is the property of such lessees as their interests may appear under the plan of unitization, subject, however, to the right of the unit to the possession, management, use, or disposal of the same in the proper conduct of its affairs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The amount of the unit production allocated to each separately owned tract within the unit, and only that amount, regardless of the well or wells in the unit area from which it may be produced, and regardless of whether it be more or less than the amount of the production from the well or wells, if any, on any such separately owned tract, must for all intents, uses, and purposes be regarded and considered as production from such separately owned tract, and, except as may be otherwise authorized in sections <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>1 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>16, or in the plan of unitization approved by the commission, must be distributed among or the proceeds thereof paid to the several persons entitled to share in the production from such separately owned tract in the same manner, in the same proportions, and upon the same conditions that they would have participated and shared in the production or proceeds thereof from such separately owned tract had not said unit been organized, and with the same legal force and effect. If adequate provisions are made for the receipt thereof, the share of the unit production allocated to each separately owned tract must be delivered in kind to the persons entitled thereto by virtue of ownership of oil and gas rights therein or by purchase from such owners subject to the rights of the unit to withhold and sell the same in payment of unit expense pursuant to the plan of unitization, and subject further to the call of the unit on such proportions of the gas for operating purposes as may be provided in the plan of unitization.
     </p>
     <p>
      Operations carried on under and in accordance with the plan of unitization must be regarded and considered as a fulfillment of and compliance with all of the provisions, covenants, and conditions, express or implied, of the several oil and gas mining leases upon lands included within the unit area, or other contracts pertaining to the development thereof, insofar as said leases or other contracts may relate to the common source of supply or portion thereof included in the unit area. Wells drilled or operated on any part of the unit area no matter where located must for all purposes be regarded as wells drilled on each separately owned tract within such unit area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing herein or in any plan of unitization may be construed as increasing or decreasing the express or implied covenants of a lease in respect to a unit source of supply or lands not included within the unit area of a unit. However, when an oil and gas lease covers and affects lands partially within and partially without the unit area, unit operations and unit production allocated to the lease, as provided in this section, may not be deemed operations on or production from the lease as to the lands covered by the lease lying outside the unit area after two years from the effective date of the order of the commission creating and approving the unit or the expiration of the primary term of the lease, whichever is the later date. After the later date, the lease as to lands outside the unit area may be maintained in force and effect only in accordance with the terms and provisions contained in the lease.

      The unit area of a unit may be enlarged at any time by the commission, subject to the limitations provided in this chapter to include adjoining portions of the same common source of supply, including the unit area of another unit, and a new unit created for the unitized management, operation, and further development of the enlarged unit area, or the plan of unitization may be otherwise amended, all in the same manner, upon the same conditions and subject to the same limitations as provided with respect to the creation of a unit in the first instance, except, that where an amendment to a plan of unitization relates only to the rights and obligations as between lessees, or the amendment to a plan of unitization or the enlargement of a unit area is found by the commission to be reasonably necessary in order to effectively carry on the joint effort, to prevent waste, and to protect correlative rights, and that such will result in the general advantage of the owners of the oil and gas rights within the unit area and the proposed enlarged unit area, and the persons and owners in the proposed added unit area have ratified or approved the plan of unitization as required by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-08s38-08-09" target="_self">38-08-09.</a></cite>5, then the amendment to a plan of unitization or the enlargement of a unit area need not be ratified or approved by royalty owners of record in the existing unit area provided that written notice thereof is mailed to the royalty owners by the operator of a unit not more than forty days nor less than thirty days prior to the commission hearing. The notice must describe the plan for the unit amendment or enlargement together with the participation factor to be given each tract in the unit area and in the proposed area and must contain the time and place of the commission hearing. An affidavit of mailing verifying the notice must be filed with the commission. The notice must further provide that in the event ten percent of the royalty interests or working interests in the existing unit area file with the commission at least ten days prior to the commission proceeding an objection to the plan of enlargement, the commission shall require that the unit amendment or enlargement be approved by more than fifty-five percent of all royalty interests and working interests in the existing and proposed areas.

       District court properly dismissed a nonparticipating cotenant's declaratory judgment action and claim for specific performance because the nonparticipating cotenant failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and could not establish that it was a third-party beneficiary of an assignment between the participating cotenant and the assignee inasmuch as the Industrial Commission had the ability to request any documents necessary from the assignee or the participating cotenant, their assignment clearly and explicitly declared there were no third-party beneficiaries, and the parol evidence rule precluded the nonparticipating cotenant from introducing extrinsic evidence to contradict the agreement.

        Plaintiffs, who were represented by counsel and expert witnesses, participated in the proper spacing hearings before the Industrial Commission, had a full and fair opportunity to argue their version of the facts and applicable law, and although they sought judicial review by appeal to the district court, they did not have the Commission’s order suspended or stayed and thereby allowed the order to continue in force and effect as if no appeal was pending; therefore, the district court should have dismissed, plaintiffs’ subsequent action for damages resulting from improper spacing as an impermissible collateral attack on the Commission’s spacing order.

        North Dakota Industrial Commission’s decision to impose a risk penalty under
   N.D.C.C. § 38-08-08 was not given deference because the findings of fact were not sufficient; the decision did not explain how the Commission reached the conclusion that a risk penalty could have been assessed due to an untimely acceptance of an invitation. Even if immaterial or insubstantial deviations from the administrative requirements that did not refer to estimations or approximations were allowable, there was no explanation why, in view of the changes made in a second letter, that a second owner’s 10 day tardiness in accepting the invitation and forwarding its share of the costs was not an equally immaterial and insubstantial deviation.

        Since no provision is made by statutes or rules of state industrial commission for suspension of an order of commission pending a hearing de novo or a rehearing, no provision exists for fixing of a supersedeas bond upon application for suspension of a commission order. Thomas Producing Co. v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 229 F. Supp. 433, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8227 (D.N.D. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff, an oil company, filed application with state industrial commission seeking an exception to prescribed spacing pattern in connection with drilling a test well for oil and gas. The application was approved and drilling exception was granted. Defendant corporation requested suspension of the order pending hearing de novo before commission. The commission attached no conditions to granting a hearing de novo but only required defendant to file a supersedeas bond which caused plaintiff to cease drilling operations. The defendant, who made no objection to conditioning of order of suspension on filing of bond and did not file bond under protest, could not contend that bond was not voluntary and binding although commission had no authority to require defendant to file the bond.

       Illegal oil, illegal gas, and illegal product are declared to be contraband and are subject to seizure and sale as herein provided; seizure and sale to be in addition to any and all other remedies and penalties provided in this chapter for violations relating to illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product. Whenever the commission believes that any oil, gas, or product is illegal, the commission acting by the attorney general, shall bring a civil action in rem in the district court of the county where such oil, gas, or product is found, to seize and sell the same, or the commission may include such an action in rem for the seizure and sale of illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product in any suit brought for an injunction or penalty involving illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product. Any person claiming an interest in oil, gas, or product affected by any such action in rem has the right to intervene as an interested party in such action.

       Actions for the seizure and sale of illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product must be strictly in rem and must proceed in the name of the state as plaintiff against the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal products as defendant. No bond or similar undertaking may be required of the plaintiff. Upon the filing of the petition for seizure and sale, the attorney general shall issue a summons, with a copy of the complaint attached thereto, which must be served in the manner provided for service in civil actions, upon any and all persons having or claiming any interest in the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product described in the petition. Service must be completed by the filing of an affidavit by the person making the service, stating the time and manner of making such service. Any person who fails to appear and answer within the period of thirty days is forever barred by the judgment based on such service. The posting of copies of the summons and petition as above provided operates to place the state in constructive possession of the oil, gas, or product described in the petition. In addition, if the court, on a properly verified petition, or affidavits, or oral testimony, finds that grounds for seizure and for sale exist, the court shall issue an immediate order of seizure, describing the oil, gas, or product to be seized and directing the sheriff of the county to take such oil, gas, or product into the sheriff’s custody, actual or constructive, and to hold the same subject to the further order of the court. The court, in such order of seizure, may direct the sheriff to deliver the oil, gas, or product seized by the sheriff under the order to an agent appointed by the court, as the agent of the court; such agent to give bond in an amount and with such surety as the court may direct, conditioned upon the agent’s compliance with the orders of the court concerning the custody and disposition of such oil, gas, or product.

      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-15ol14">
       Any person having an interest in oil, gas, or product described in an order of seizure and contesting the right of the state to the seizure and sale thereof may, prior to the sale thereof as herein provided, obtain the release thereof, upon furnishing bond to the sheriff approved by the court, in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent of the market value of the oil, gas, or product to be released, and conditioned as the court may direct upon redelivery to the sheriff of such product released or upon payment to the sheriff of the market value thereof as the court may direct, if and when ordered by the court, and upon full compliance with the further orders of the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-08s38-08-15ol15">
       If the court, after a hearing upon a petition for the seizure and sale of oil, gas, or product, finds that such oil, gas, or product is contraband, the court shall order the sale thereof by the sheriff in the same manner and upon the same notice of sale as provided by law for the sale of personal property on execution of judgment entered in a civil action, except that the court may order that the illegal oil, illegal gas, or illegal product be sold in specified lots or portions and at specified intervals. Upon such sale, title to the oil, gas, or product sold vests in the purchaser free of the claims of any and all persons having any title thereto or interest therein at or prior to the seizure thereof, and the same is legal oil, legal gas, or legal product, as the case may be, in the hands of the purchaser.

     <p>
      The commission shall immediately forward notice of the issuance of a permit to the board of county commissioners of the county in which the lands are located. The commission may revoke the permit of any person engaging in geophysical exploration upon a showing that that person has violated any applicable requirement pertaining to geophysical exploration. The commission shall notify that person, by the most effective written means, of the permit revocation. Upon notification, the person engaging in geophysical exploration may, within fifteen days, request a hearing before the commission on the matter. The commission shall either affirm, modify, or deny the permit revocation. The commission may also suspend the permit temporarily in those cases where climate and physical conditions are such as to cause harm, damage, or undue stress to roads, bridges, pastures, crops, or other physical features. For these same reasons, a board of county commissioners, upon notice to the permitholder and the commission, also may suspend, for not longer than forty-eight hours, a permit for operations within the county.

     <p>
      The state or any of its departments and agencies when making a public offering for lease of state-owned mineral interests may allow private owners of mineral interests common to the state’s mineral interests to offer their mineral interests at the public offering to be conducted by the state. The state-owned and privately owned mineral interests must be offered separately at the public offering. Privately owned mineral interests may only be offered when the common state-owned mineral interest is being offered. The private mineral owners shall submit a signed and notarized lease form to the state at the time they submit their minerals for inclusion in a public offering together with a current title opinion for the mineral interests certified by an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of North Dakota. The lease to be used by the private mineral owners must be on a form prescribed by the board of university and school lands in which the lease term, royalty rate, and rental rate are consistent with the state-owned mineral lease term and rates. The executed lease must be submitted to the leasing agency prior to the cutoff date for the public offering as established by the leasing agency. The private mineral interests must be advertised in the same manner as provided for in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-09s38-09-15" target="_self">38-09-15.</a></cite> No bid may be accepted unless the bidder, at the time of the leasing, tenders or pays to the leasing official an amount equal to the bonus offered for the lease. The payment must be in the form of a thirty-day sight draft payable upon approval of title. The leasing official, in exchange for tender of the bonus, shall deliver to the successful bidder the executed lease. The leasing agency shall, as soon as practical after the sale, forward the thirty-day draft to the private mineral owners. The person must agree to warrant and defend title to the mineral interest being offered for lease before being allowed to offer the mineral interest for sale under this section. When a person agrees to offer a mineral interest at a public offering that interest may not be withdrawn from the offering. A person offering a mineral interest at a public offering under this section shall agree to pay prior to sale an equitable share of the costs incurred by the state in making that public offering. Nothing in this section may be construed or interpreted to impose any liability or obligation upon the state or any of its departments, agencies, agents, or employees by reason of any acts or omissions done under this section.

The state of North Dakota and all agencies, departments, and political subdivisions thereof, are specifically authorized to enter into agreements for the consolidation of land covered by leases on lands under the jurisdiction of such bodies with other adjoining or neighboring lands for the purpose of joint development and operation of the entire consolidated premises as a unit. In such a case, such agreement must provide that the lessor shall share in the royalty on oil and gas produced from a consolidated tract in the proportion that the area of the land covered by such lease bears to the total area of such consolidated tract, or upon such other royalty sharing basis as may appear equitable to the governing body controlling or administering such lands; and operations or production on such consolidated tract shall have the same effect as operations or production under the terms of each such lease included therein.

    Term of lease for production — Conditions and limitations in lease.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A lease for production made by a personal representative may be made subject to the confirmation of the district court, for a period of not more than ten years, and it may be extended thereafter as long as oil or gas is produced from such land by the lessee or the lessee’s assigns or the lessee or the lessee’s assigns are engaged in continuous drilling or reworking operations. Such a lease must be made upon such terms and in consideration of such bonuses, royalties, rentals, and payments as may be agreed upon except that in no case may the royalty be:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t38c38-10s38-10-03ol11">
       Less than equal to a one-eighth part of all oil produced and saved from the leased premises;
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-10s38-10-03ol12">
       Less than equal to a one-eighth part of the gross proceeds at the prevailing market rate at the well for all gas used off the premises, when gas only is found on the leased premises; nor
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-10s38-10-03ol13">
       Less than one-eighth of the gross proceeds at the prevailing market rate at the well for gas, during all times that such gas is used, when gas is produced from any oil well and used off the premises or for the manufacture of casinghead gasoline or dry commercial gas.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      No lease for production is effective for a period of more than two years from its date unless mining or a well is commenced on such land within such time, except that the lease may provide that the lessee may pay a delay rental in an amount that may be specified in the lease. Such payment operates as a rental and covers the privilege of deferring the commencement of mining or of a well for one year. A lease may provide for the payment of successive delay rentals which defers the commencement of mining or of a well for like successive periods. Any lease made by a personal representative under the authority of this section may provide for the pooling or unitization of the lease land, or any part or parts thereof, and of any mineral or royalty interest therein, with land adjoining or in the vicinity of the leased land, or any mineral or royalty interest therein, so as to form a unit for development and purpose of operation. Operations or production on any such unitized area shall have the same effect as operations or production on the leased land. The lease may provide for payment of a proportionate part of the royalties on production from any such unitized area to the personal representative in lieu of the royalties provided in the lease as to the area so unitized. A personal representative, upon compliance with the provisions of this chapter, may also enter into agreements pooling or unitizing existing leases. Upon the execution, approval, and delivery of a production lease, all persons interested in the estate are bound thereby during the entire period thereof.

      It is the purpose of this chapter to provide the maximum amount of constitutionally permissible protection to surface owners and other persons from the undesirable effects of development of minerals. This chapter is to be interpreted in light of the legislative intent expressed herein. Sections 38-11.1-04 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-11.1s38-11.1-04" target="_self">38-11.1-04.</a></cite>1 must be interpreted to benefit surface owners, regardless of whether the mineral estate was separated from the surface estate and regardless of who executed the document which gave the mineral developer the right to conduct drilling operations on the land. Sections 38-11.1-06 through 38-11.1-10 must be interpreted to benefit all persons.

       <p>
        When the provisions of N.D.C.C. §§ 38-11.1-04, 47-01-04, and 47-01-12 are read together, pore space is part of the surface owner's interest in the land for purposes of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-11.1s38-11.1-04" target="_self">38-11.1-04.</a></cite> The Supreme Court of North Dakota concludes a surface owner may be entitled to compensation under N.D.C.C. § 38-11.1-04 for a mineral developer's use of the surface owner's subsurface pore space for disposal of saltwater generated as a result of drilling operations. 2017 ND 169, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 38-11.1-04 requires a mineral developer to pay a surface owner a sum of money equal to the amount of damages sustained by the surface owner for lost land value, lost use of and access to the surface owner's land, and lost value of improvements caused by drilling operations. The plain language of that statute is not limited to whether the owner of a surface estate is currently using or planning to use the pore space in the near future. Rather, the statutory language requires the mineral developer to pay the surface owner for lost land value, lost use of and access to the surface owner's land, and lost value of improvements. 2017 ND 169, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite>.
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 38-11.1-04's language is not limited to a diminution in market value of the owner of the surface estate's interest and includes a surface owner's lost use of and access to a surface owner's pore space at some time in the future regardless of the surface owner's current use or future plan for use of the pore space. 2017 ND 169, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        Plain language of N.D.C.C. § 38-11.1-04 does not preclude a surface owner from recovering what others may be paying to dispose of saltwater in pore space; rather, the price per barrel others are paying for saltwater disposal may provide some probative evidence of the amount a surface owner may be damaged for lost use of and access to the surface owner's land under § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-11.1s38-11.1-04" target="_self">38-11.1-04.</a></cite> 2017 ND 169, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Surface owners could not recover damages for a mineral lessee’s use of a reserve pit because such use was not unreasonable; although a closed loop system could have been used as an alternative, reserve pits were commonly used in North Dakota at the time, and an administrative rule expressly allowed their use. Limited discovery was appropriate as to the issue of whether the lessee reclaimed and maintained the reserve pit in a reasonable manner.

       Mineral lessee provided sufficient notice to surface owners under former N.D.C.C. § 38-11.1-05 by reasonably estimating the amount of acreage it would occupy and the time its drilling and completion operations would take. The information allowed the surface owners to evaluate the effect of the lessee’s activities on their use of the property, and the owners had no right to make specific demands as to how the lessee would use the surface estate.

      If the domestic, livestock, or irrigation water supply of any person who owns an interest in real property within one-half mile [804.67 meters] of where geophysical or seismograph activities are or have been conducted or within one mile [1.61 kilometers] of an oil or gas well site has been disrupted, or diminished in quality or quantity by the drilling operations and a certified water quality and quantity test has been performed by the person who owns an interest in real property within one year preceding the commencement of drilling operations, the person who owns an interest in real property is entitled to recover the cost of making such repairs, alterations, or construction that will ensure the delivery to the surface owner of that quality and quantity of water available to the surface owner prior to the commencement of drilling operations. Any person who owns an interest in real property who obtains all or a part of that person’s water supply for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or other beneficial use from an underground source has a claim for relief against a mineral developer to recover damages for disruption or diminution in quality or quantity of that person’s water supply proximately caused from drilling operations conducted by the mineral developer. Prima facie evidence of injury under this section may be established by a showing that the mineral developer’s drilling operations penetrated or disrupted an aquifer in such a manner as to cause a diminution in water quality or quantity within the distance limits imposed by this section. An action brought under this section when not otherwise specifically provided by law must be brought within six years of the time the action has accrued. For purposes of this section, the claim for relief is deemed to have accrued at the time it is discovered or might have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable diligence.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tract of land is not bound to receive water contaminated by drilling operations on another tract of land, and the owner of a tract has a claim for relief against a mineral developer to recover the damages proximately resulting from natural drainage of waters contaminated by drilling operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The mineral developer is also responsible for all damages to person or property resulting from the lack of ordinary care by the mineral developer or resulting from a nuisance caused by drilling operations. This section does not create a cause of action if an appropriator of water can reasonably acquire the water under the changed conditions and if the changed conditions are a result of the legal appropriation of water by the mineral developer.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The mineral developer shall pay the surface owner a sum of money equal to the amount of damages sustained by the surface owner and the surface owner’s tenant, if any, for loss of agricultural production and income caused by oil and gas production and completion operations. The amount of damages may be determined by any formula mutually agreeable between the surface owner and the mineral developer. When determining damages for loss of production, consideration must be given to the period of time during which the loss occurs and the damages for loss of production must be paid annually unless the surface owner elects to receive a single lump sum payment. Payments under this section are intended to compensate the surface owner for loss of production. Any reservation or assignment of such compensation apart from the surface estate, except to a tenant of the surface estate, is prohibited. In the absence of an agreement between the surface owner and a tenant as to the division of compensation payable under this section, the tenant is entitled to recover from the surface owner that portion of the compensation attributable to the tenant’s share of the damages sustained.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person that owns a mineral, leasehold, or royalty interest underlying a tract of land may petition the district court of the county in which the tract or a portion of the tract is located to declare a trust in favor of other persons also owning or claiming an interest in the mineral, leasehold, or royalty interest underlying the tract if the place of residence and present whereabouts of the other persons are unknown and cannot reasonably be ascertained. In requesting the appointment of a trustee, the petitioner must show that a diligent but unsuccessful effort to locate the absent owner or claimant has been made and that appointment of a trustee will be in the best interest of all owners of an interest in the mineral, leasehold, or royalty interest. After determining that these conditions have been met, the court shall appoint the county treasurer as trustee and shall authorize the county treasurer to execute and deliver an oil, gas, or other mineral lease, a ratification, a division order, or any other related document or instrument on the terms and the conditions as the court may approve. A trust in existence on August 1, 2007, may be transferred to the county treasurer of the county in which the mineral, leasehold, or royalty interest is located.

     <p>
      The administration of the trust must comply with the appropriate provisions regulating trusts contained in title 59. Except as provided in this section, trustee or attorney’s fees may not be paid from the trust proceeds. All bonuses, rental payments, royalties, and other income must be paid to the trustee until the trust is terminated and notice of its termination is given to all interested parties. The trustee shall distribute all moneys held in the trust to the person entitled to the money upon the order of the district court. A trust in favor of unlocatable owners must be kept in force until the unlocatable owners of the mineral interests in question have successfully claimed their share of the funds held in trust and have filed the notice as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-13.1s38-13.1-04" target="_self">38-13.1-04.</a></cite> The creation of a trust in favor of unlocatable owners does not affect the right of a surface owner who succeeds to ownership of a mineral interest upon its lapse under chapter 38-18.1. A person who succeeds to ownership under chapter 38-18.1 owns the mineral interest and the proceeds from the mineral interest from the date of succession. The trustee shall invest funds in a prudent manner. Upon receipt, fifty percent of the moneys paid to the trustee must be credited to the general fund of the county in which the mineral interest is located to defray the costs of administration. Funds held in trust are subject to the laws governing abandoned property as provided in chapter 47-30.2.

      A person claiming an interest in the mineral, leasehold, or royalty interest underlying a tract of land that is the subject of a trust proceeding under section 38-13.1-01 may record with the recorder of each county in which the land is located a notice containing the person’s address and a description of the person’s mineral, leasehold, or royalty interest. Recording the notice creates a rebuttable presumption that the person owns the interest claimed.

      The legislative assembly finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t38c38-14.1s38-14.1-01ol11">
       Many surface coal mining operations may result in disturbances of surface areas that adversely affect the public welfare by diminishing the utility of land for commercial, industrial, residential, cultural, educational, scientific, recreational, agricultural, and forestry purposes, by causing erosion, by polluting the water, by destroying fish and wildlife habitats, by impairing natural beauty, by damaging the property of citizens, by creating hazards dangerous to life and property, by degrading the quality of life in local communities, and by counteracting governmental programs and efforts to conserve soil, water, other natural resources, and cultural resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-14.1s38-14.1-01ol12">
       The expansion of coal mining to meet the nation’s energy needs makes even more urgent the establishment of appropriate standards to minimize damage to the environment and to productivity of the soil and to protect the health and safety of the public.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-14.1s38-14.1-01ol13">
       Surface mining and reclamation technology as now developed requires effective and reasonable regulation of surface coal mining operations in accordance with the requirements of this chapter to minimize so far as practicable the adverse social, economic, and environmental effects of such mining operations.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-14.1s38-14.1-01ol14">
       Surface coal mining operations contribute to the economic well-being, security, and general welfare of the state and should be conducted in an environmentally sound manner.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-14.1s38-14.1-01ol15">
       Surface coal mining and reclamation operations should be so conducted as to aid in maintaining and improving the tax base, to provide for the conservation, development, management, and appropriate use of all the natural resources of affected areas for compatible multiple purposes, and to ensure the restoration of affected lands designated for agricultural purposes to the level of productivity equal to or greater than that which existed in the permit area prior to mining.
      </li>
      <li id="t38c38-14.1s38-14.1-01ol16">
       Warrantless inspections are necessary in this state to ensure effective enforcement of surface coal mining and reclamation operation requirements.

       Under
   N.D.C.C. § 28-32-49, the state supreme court’s review of the Commission’s decision that conditionally approved the mining company’s surface mining permit revision application involved the same standard of review of the Commission’s decision as the standard applied by the trial court under

      It is unlawful for any operator to engage in surface coal mining operations without first obtaining from the commission a permit to do so. All existing surface coal mining operations must on July 1, 1979, comply with this chapter and all rules adopted under the chapter, except that lands from which the coal has been removed before July 1, 1979, are governed by the reclamation standards that were in effect at the time of coal removal from the lands. A person or operator shall engage in the inventorying and evaluation of cultural resources upon compliance with section 55-03-01 and may implement a cultural resource mitigation plan approved by the director of the state historical society before applying for or receiving an approved surface coal mining and reclamation permit.

        Mining Permit Revision.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the public service commission (PSC) made its own assessment of the effect of mining and reclamation operations on water quantity and quality and the rights of prior users, applying the same standards as the State Engineer and the additional standards listed under subsection (7), the assessment satisfied this section. Coteau Props. Co. v. Oster, 2000 ND 23, 606 N.W.2d 876, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although statutory law establish that restoring land to agricultural use was one purpose of the surface coal mining and reclamation program, that law did not mandate that agricultural use was the highest or best use, especially since neither N.D.C.C. § 38-14.1-24(2) nor its implementing regulations established a hierarchy of post-mining land uses. As a result, the Commission could find that the mining company’s application for revision of its surface mining permit to allow for recreational post-mining use of certain land was the best approach under that statute, especially since N.D.C.C. § 1-02-02 regarding statutory interpretation dictated that statutory language was to be given its plain meaning, N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07 compelled a statute to be read as a whole, and N.D.C.C. § 1-02-05 required that a court interpreting a statute such as the surface mining statute pursue the letter of the statute rather than its spirit.
   Dakota Res. Council v. N.D. PSC, 2012 ND 72, 815 N.W.2d 286, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission could find that the substantial public benefit that would occur if the mining company’s surface mining permit revision request was granted warranted a revision in that permit allowing a certain amount of post-mining land to be converted to recreational use rather than agricultural and industrial use. Under N.D.C.C. § 38-14.1-24(17), post-mining lands used for agriculture were subject to a minimum 10-year bond liability period and had to be restored to the level of productivity equal to or greater, under equivalent management practices, than non-mined agricultural lands of similar soil types in the surrounding area, while the mining company would have an easier time regarding post-mining revegetation if the permit revision was granted.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds and declares that there are a substantial number of acres [hectares] within the state disturbed by surface coal mining operations and noncoal mining operations on which little or no reclamation was conducted, and the impacts from these unreclaimed lands impose social and economic costs on residents in nearby and adjoining areas as well as continuing to impair environmental quality. It is, therefore, the purpose of this chapter to promote the reclamation of mined areas left without adequate reclamation prior to the enactment of this chapter and which continue, in their unreclaimed condition, to substantially degrade the quality of the environment, prevent or damage the beneficial use of land or water resources, or endanger the health or safety of the public.

Before the lien may be enforced, written notice of intention to enforce the lien must be given by personal service upon the record owner of the land affected at least ten days before an action to enforce the lien is commenced, or by certified mail directed to the owner’s last-known address at least twenty days before the action is commenced. The land affected may not be sold for less than the fair market value of the land after the restoration, reclamation, abatement, control, or prevention of adverse effects of past coal mining or noncoal mining practices. No deficiency judgment may issue against the record owner of the land affected if the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to satisfy the total amount of the lien on the land.

    Gravel and sand surface mining operations — Reclamation — Civil action — Penalty.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any surface mining operator conducting a gravel or sand surface mining operation on land in this state owned by another person, upon completion or abandonment of the surface mining operation, shall reclaim the affected land. Each surface mining operator shall negotiate with the landowner a written agreement providing for the reclamation of the affected land. Unless the affected land is to be used for other purposes as agreed upon between the surface mining operator and the landowner, the reclamation agreement must, at a minimum, provide for restoration by the surface mining operator of the affected land as nearly as possible to the agreed contour and usability; indicate the amount of topsoil and subsoil to be saved, segregated, and respread; and indicate the party responsible for compaction of backfill, soil testing, fertilization, revegetation, weed control, rock disposal, and replacement or establishment of conservation practices. The reclamation must be within a time period agreed upon between the parties, but within one year after the final cessation of surface mining operations. A landowner may bring a claim for relief in any appropriate district court against the surface mining operator who has failed to reclaim properly affected land pursuant to a reclamation agreement under this section. In an action under this section, a surface mining operator is liable for damage in an amount necessary to reclaim the land. Any person who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a class B misdemeanor.

     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislative assembly of the state of North Dakota to exercise the legitimate police power of the state in order to protect the economic welfare of the citizens who rely for their livelihood on agricultural production and thereby protect the agricultural economic base of the state. It is in the public interest that certain of the terms and conditions of the leases of coal in place be regulated. The provisions of this chapter apply to all leases for the mining of coal entered into after April 9, 1975.

       The legislative assembly finds that it is necessary to exercise the police power of the state as described in this chapter to protect the public welfare of North Dakota which is largely dependent on agriculture and to protect the economic well-being of individuals engaged in agricultural production.

      <li id="t38c38-18s38-18-02ol12">
       Furthermore, the legislative assembly finds that there is an abundance of minerals in North Dakota which can be used for the production of electricity, synthetic natural gas, and other forms of energy, and that energy produced from North Dakota minerals is needed by the nation and North Dakota is capable of producing up to two and one-half percent of the nation’s energy needs if the minerals found here are fully developed.

       Before the public service commission may issue a permit to surface mine land, the mineral developer shall give the surface owner written notice of the type of land disturbance or mining operation contemplated by the mineral developer. This notice must sufficiently disclose the plan of work and operations to enable the surface owner to evaluate the extent of the land disturbance on the surface owner’s use of the property. The notice must be accompanied by an enlarged United States geological survey topographic map showing the specific locations to be covered by the mining operation. The notice and map must be submitted to the surface owner at least thirty days before the application for a permit to surface mine is to be submitted.

Any previously executed mineral lease or surface lease in favor of the mineral developer, the developer’s successors, assigns, or predecessors in title runs with the land and is binding on a subsequent mineral owner or owners or surface owner or owners, as the case may be.

       If the mineral developer desires to have the developer’s permit amended to cover additional land, the mineral developer shall file either consent statements or surface or mineral leases executed by the surface owners of such additional land as required by this section with the application to amend the permit to cover additional land. If, in addition, all of the requirements of chapter 38-14.1 are met, the public service commission may issue the amended permit.

       If the mineral owner or the mineral developer is unable to obtain the surface owner’s consent, the mineral owner or mineral developer may bring an action in district court to establish the relative rights of the parties and the measure of damages to the surface owner. At any time after the filing of any such action and either before or after the final decision of the district court, upon a showing to the satisfaction of the court that the surface owner will be adequately compensated for lost production, lost land value, and loss of the value of improvements due to the mining activity, the court shall issue an order which will authorize the public service commission to issue a permit to surface mine land without the consent which would otherwise be required by this section. In the event the damages awarded by the court to the surface owner exceed the amount tendered or otherwise provided for, the court shall award to the surface owner reasonable attorney’s fees in addition to any other sums determined to be due to the surface owner.

       Unless the mineral lease, surface lease, or consent statement executed by the surface owner provides for payments to the surface owner, the mineral developer shall annually pay to the surface owner a sum of money equal to the amount of damages sustained by the surface owner for loss of agricultural production caused by mining activity, provided that it can be shown that the land disturbed or to be disturbed has regularly been used for agricultural production. The amount of damages may be determined by any formula mutually agreeable between the surface owner and the mineral developer. The payments contemplated by this section only cover land actually mined, disturbed, or to be mined during the year or years during which agricultural production was actually interrupted and which land has not been restored to the level of agricultural productivity required by the plan submitted pursuant to chapter 38-14.1.

        Mineral interest does not automatically vest in the surface owners upon the publication of the first notice of lapse and the mineral owner’s interest does not become a reversionary interest; moreover, under N.D.C.C. §§ 38-18.1-02, 38-18.1-04, 38-18.1-05, a mineral interest vests in the surface owners when it is abandoned, and it is not abandoned if a statement of claim is recorded within sixty days of the publication of the notice of lapse. Therefore, where a timely recorded statement of claim was filed, mineral interests were not abandoned.

        Quiet title requirements in N.D.C.C. § 38-18.1-06(2) could not be used to deprive plaintiffs of an interest in the minerals that had already vested under former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-18.1s38-18.1-02" target="_self">38-18.1-02.</a></cite> Therefore, the district court did not err by not requiring plaintiffs to prove in the quiet title action that they made a reasonable inquiry for defendant’s mailing address before mailing the notice of lapse.

       </p>
       <p>
        Quiet title judgment entered in 1990 was not vacated because any defect in the mailing of the notice of a mineral interest lapse did not deprive the district court of personal jurisdiction in the subsequent quiet title action; rather, personal jurisdiction in the quiet title action was governed solely by compliance with the civil procedure service rule. A district court had personal jurisdiction over the quiet title action, the judgment was not void, and relief from the judgment was not available. Peterson v.

        District court did not err in concluding that the surface rights owner failed to comply with N.D.C.C. § 38-18.1-06(2) (2004) when he sent notice by mail to the address appearing on a mineral deed, but did not send notice to another address appearing on a later oil and gas lease, because the phrase “the address of record” required the surface owner to send notice to the most recent address of record. Nelson v. McAlester Fuel Co., 2017 ND 49, 891 N.W.2d 126, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        When finding if surface owners' notice of a lapse of mineral interests met statutory requirements by supplementing an address of record with a zip code, the surface owners did not have to rely on a lease signed by a person whose name was similar to the person to whom notice was sent because the record did not show the persons were the same. Huebner v. Furlinger, 2017 ND 145, 896 N.W.2d 258, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Surface owners did not meet statutory requirements by supplementing a record address with a zip code, when giving notice of a lapse of mineral interests, because (1) the surface owners had to send notice to the address as the address appeared on the record, and (2) nothing showed how or why the zip code was chosen, that the zip code was correct, or whether omitting the zip code would have made a difference. Huebner v. Furlinger, 2017 ND 145, 896 N.W.2d 258, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Publishing notice of a lapse of mineral interests to a mineral owner did not meet statutory requirements when the owner's address was not on a personal representative's deed, which was the most recent document of record, because prior documents showed the address. Huebner v. Furlinger, 2017 ND 145, 896 N.W.2d 258, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Surface interest owners gave adequate notice of lapse of a deceased mineral interest owner's interest because (1) the surface owners mailed notice to addresses “of record,” (2) certified mail with restricted delivery did not violate N.D.C.C. § 38-18.1-06(2), as the statutory scheme did not require or bar a type of mailing, and (3) it was error to hold the mineral owner's address did not appear of record due to the interest devolving to the owner's heirs. Capps v. Weflen, 2014 ND 201, 855 N.W.2d 637, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 205</cite> (N.D. 2014), cert. denied, 575 U.S. 913, 135 S. Ct. 1551, 191 L.

       <p>
        Surface interest owners giving notice of a lapse of mineral interests did not have to make “reasonable inquiry” into the mineral owner's address, even if the surface owners knew the mineral owner was dead, because the mineral owner's address appeared of record. Capps v. Weflen, 2014 ND 201, 855 N.W.2d 637, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 205</cite> (N.D. 2014), cert. denied, 575 U.S. 913, 135 S. Ct. 1551, 191 L.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Quiet title requirements in N.D.C.C. § 38-18.1-06(2) could not be used to deprive plaintiffs of an interest in the minerals that had already vested under former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t38c38-18.1s38-18.1-02" target="_self">38-18.1-02.</a></cite> Therefore, the district court did not err by not requiring plaintiffs to prove in the quiet title action that they made a reasonable inquiry for defendant’s mailing address before mailing the notice of lapse.
   Johnson v. Taliaferro, 2011 ND 34, 793 N.W.2d 804, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Quiet title judgment entered in 1990 was not vacated because any defect in the mailing of the notice of a mineral interest lapse did not deprive the district court of personal jurisdiction in the subsequent quiet title action; rather, personal jurisdiction in the quiet title action was governed solely by compliance with the civil procedure service rule. A district court had personal jurisdiction over the quiet title action, the judgment was not void, and relief from the judgment was not available. Peterson v. Jasmanka, 2014 ND 40, 842 N.W.2d 920, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        Whether property owner had made a reasonable inquiry to ascertain the addresses of mineral interest owners was a question of fact and inappropriate for summary judgment. Spring Creek Ranch, LLC v. Svenberg, 1999 ND 113, 595 N.W.2d 323, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Title to oil, gas and other minerals had to be quieted in favor of the surface owner where, under N.D.C.C. § 38-18.1-06, a surface owner had to conduct a reasonable inquiry for the mineral owner’s address when an address appeared of record, which he did, and the mineral owner did not receive notice because she did not keep her address current.

       <p>
        Summary judgment was improper when a corporation negligently, and belatedly, mailed landowners’
   notice of intent to acquire abandoned mineral interests. The corporation’s negligence in failing to comply with the requirements of N.D.C.C. § 38-18.1-06(2) was the proximate cause of the landowners’
   damages, i.e., the failure to acquire the disputed mineral interests.

     <p>
      It is in the public interest to promote the geologic storage of carbon dioxide. Doing so will benefit the state and the global environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Doing so will help ensure the viability of the state’s coal and power industries, to the economic benefit of North Dakota and its citizens. Further, geologic storage of carbon dioxide, a potentially valuable commodity, may allow for its ready availability if needed for commercial, industrial, or other uses, including enhanced recovery of oil, gas, and other minerals. Geologic storage, however, to be practical and effective requires cooperative use of surface and subsurface property interests and the collaboration of property owners. Obtaining consent from all owners may not be feasible, requiring procedures that promote, in a manner fair to all interests, cooperative management, thereby ensuring the maximum use of natural resources.

      If a storage operator does not obtain the consent of all persons owning a pore space and of mineral interest owners when required by this chapter, the commission may require the interest owned by the nonconsenting owners be included in an approved storage facility and subject to geologic storage if the minimum percentage of consent is obtained as specified in this chapter. Any pore space owner who does not have responsibility over the construction, management, supervision, or control of the storage facility operations is not liable for money damages for personal or other property damages proximately caused by the operations.

       Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the storage operator, mineral owners, and lease owners, royalties on gas produced but not sold and which is injected into a storage facility instead of flaring or for lack of market, are not due on the produced and stored gas until gas volumes actually are withdrawn from the storage facility, sold, and proceeds received from the sale.

       Prior to gas being withdrawn and sold from a storage facility under this section, the storage operator, after notice and hearing, shall obtain approval from the commission evidencing a reasonable and equitable method of allocation of the stored gas sale proceeds to the rightful mineral, royalty, and leasehold owners of the gas injected into storage. The commission may adopt such rules and orders as necessary to implement the purposes of this section.
