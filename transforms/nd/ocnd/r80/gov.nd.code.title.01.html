        District court erred in finding that the testator’s missing will was not presumed to be revoked, because while N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-07 did not speak to admitting a lost will and neither N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-14-03 nor 30.1-15-02 provided specific presumptions for admitting a missing will, the drafter’s of the Uniform Probate Code did contemplate the probate of lost wills, and the district court erroneously failed to apply the common law amino revocandi presumption that a missing will was revoked; if a will could not be found upon the death of the testator, the presumption arose that the testator revoked the missing will, and under N.D.R.Ev. 301(a), the party seeking to probate the missing will must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the testator did not destroy or revoke the missing will animo revocandi.

        In the statute defining second-degree manslaughter as applied to the operation of an automobile, the term “culpable negligence” implied a total lack of care which could be described as operating an automobile in a reckless and heedless manner with utter disregard for the lives and limbs of persons upon the highway. State v. Gulke, 76 N.D. 653, 38 N.W.2d 722 (1949), decided prior to the enactment of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.12.1.html#t12.1c12.1-16s12.1-16-02" target="_blank">12.1-16-02</a></cite>.

        One is a purchaser for value who takes a negotiable promissory note in the usual course of business from the payee who transfers it by endorsement of a guaranty of payment and the paper is in payment of an antecedent debt.

        In a dispute over an oil and gas lease, it was error for a trial court to grant summary judgment upon concluding, as a matter of law, that an individual was not a bona fide purchaser, due to having constructive notice of another’s claim when recording the lease, because (1) whether the individual had notice was a question of fact, (2) deciding an issue on summary judgment was not appropriate if the court had to draw inferences or make findings on disputed facts, (3) although two corporations argued the facts were not disputed, the corporations did not agree on the inferences that could be drawn from the evidence, (4) more than one inference could reasonably be drawn from the evidence and findings of fact were required, which was not appropriate in a summary judgment proceeding, (5) whether the individual acquired property rights in good faith and for value required findings of fact about the events surrounding a transaction, and (6) a factual dispute existed about whether the individual had constructive notice when the individual acquired rights under the lease.

        It was no error to quiet title to real estate in owners, despite the owners not recording title until after purchasers bought the property, because the purchasers had constructive notice of the owners' conflicting interest, as the purchasers knew someone planted trees around the property, which was next to the owners' home, and that the owners watered the trees and otherwise maintained the property, but did not ask the seller if the owners bought or rented the property or if the seller had sold the property, so the purchasers were not good faith purchasers, as the owners' possession and occupancy was open and notorious.

        In an action seeking to quiet title in mineral interests, summary judgment was inappropriate because there were disputed issues of material fact about whether the buyers were good-faith purchasers for value without notice of a prior unrecorded deed. A deed that was executed in 1990, but not recorded until 2012, was valid between the parties to the instrument and those with notice, a statement of claim imposed a duty of further inquiry to ascertain the state of the ownership of the disputed mineral interests, and a buyer was deemed to have constructive notice of the facts an inquiry would have revealed.

        Because the purchasers of real estate learned that the land was for sale through an advertisement in a local newspaper, which specifically stated that “no mineral interests will pass with the land,” and that the land would be sold “subject to any leases, encumbrances, covenants, reservations, restrictions, easements, conditions and rights appearing of record,” but did not conduct any inquiry into the state of the trustee’s title but rather assumed that they were receiving the gravel underlying the property, they were deemed to have constructive notice of the records in the register of deeds’ [now recorder] office and related unrecorded contracts.

        In a dispute over an oil and gas lease, it was error for a trial court to grant summary judgment upon concluding, as a matter of law, that an individual was not a bona fide purchaser, due to having constructive notice of another’s claim when recording the lease, because (1) whether the individual had notice was a question of fact, (2) deciding an issue on summary judgment was not appropriate if the court had to draw inferences or make findings on disputed facts, (3) although two corporations argued the facts were not disputed, the corporations did not agree on the inferences that could be drawn from the evidence, (4) more than one inference could reasonably be drawn from the evidence and findings of fact were required, which was not appropriate in a summary judgment proceeding, (5) whether the individual acquired property rights in good faith and for value required findings of fact about the events surrounding a transaction, and (6) a factual dispute existed about whether the individual had constructive notice when the individual acquired rights under the lease.

        In an action seeking to quiet title in mineral interests, summary judgment was inappropriate because there were disputed issues of material fact about whether the buyers were good-faith purchasers for value without notice of a prior unrecorded deed. A deed that was executed in 1990, but not recorded until 2012, was valid between the parties to the instrument and those with notice, a statement of claim imposed a duty of further inquiry to ascertain the state of the ownership of the disputed mineral interests, and a buyer was deemed to have constructive notice of the facts an inquiry would have revealed.

        It was no error to quiet title to real estate in owners, despite the owners not recording title until after purchasers bought the property, because the purchasers had constructive notice of the owners' conflicting interest, as the purchasers knew someone planted trees around the property, which was next to the owners' home, and that the owners watered the trees and otherwise maintained the property, but did not ask the seller if the owners bought or rented the property or if the seller had sold the property, so the purchasers were not good faith purchasers, as the owners' possession and occupancy was open and notorious.

        In a dispute over an oil and gas lease, it was error for a trial court to grant summary judgment upon concluding, as a matter of law, that an individual was not a bona fide purchaser, due to having constructive notice of another’s claim when recording the lease, because (1) whether the individual had notice was a question of fact, (2) deciding an issue on summary judgment was not appropriate if the court had to draw inferences or make findings on disputed facts, (3) although two corporations argued the facts were not disputed, the corporations did not agree on the inferences that could be drawn from the evidence, (4) more than one inference could reasonably be drawn from the evidence and findings of fact were required, which was not appropriate in a summary judgment proceeding, (5) whether the individual acquired property rights in good faith and for value required findings of fact about the events surrounding a transaction, and (6) a factual dispute existed about whether the individual had constructive notice when the individual acquired rights under the lease.

        It was no error to quiet title to real estate in owners, despite the owners not recording title until after purchasers bought the property, because the purchasers had constructive notice of the owners' conflicting interest, as the purchasers knew someone planted trees around the property, which was next to the owners' home, and that the owners watered the trees and otherwise maintained the property, but did not ask the seller if the owners bought or rented the property or if the seller had sold the property, so the purchasers were not good faith purchasers, as the owners' possession and occupancy was open and notorious.

A deed that was executed in 1990, but not recorded until 2012, was valid between the parties to the instrument and those with notice, a statement of claim imposed a duty of further inquiry to ascertain the state of the ownership of the disputed mineral interests, and a buyer was deemed to have constructive notice of the facts an inquiry would have revealed.

A reasonably diligent inquiry would have required the children, at the very least, to conduct a record search.

      The word “week” means seven consecutive days and the word “month” a calendar month. The word “year” means twelve consecutive months. Fractions of a year are to be computed by the number of months; thus, half a year is six months. Fractions of a day are to be disregarded in computations which include more than one day and involve no questions of priority.

        N.D.C.C. § 42-01-07 is a list of remedies available against a public nuisance and does not limit the remedies that may be sought against the same individual for the same nuisance to only one of the listed remedies; the phrases separated by the word “or” in N.D.C.C. § 42-01-07 do not have separate and independent significance, interpreting “or” as indicating mutually exclusive alternatives is unreasonable, and the word “remedies” is plural, which indicates more than one remedy may be pursued against a public nuisance. Therefore, a trial court did not err by refusing to dismiss a criminal nuisance action based on the fact that a civil nuisance action had also been filed against defendant.

        Applicability.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the sufficiency of the information used to charge defendant was governed by the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure rather than North Dakota statutes governing procedure, the requirement under statutory law about the information being verified, as set forth in N.D.C.C. § 1-01-42, did not apply. Thus, the information used to charge defendant with an ordinance violation for allowing defendant’s dog to bark continuously and excessively, sufficiently charged defendant with violating the ordinance.

        When a divorce is granted the court has jurisdiction over all the property of the parties, both real and personal, may distribute the property as may seem just and proper, and has jurisdiction to include in the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the decree, the agreement between parties as to the division of property.

        Where the signature to a will was by mark and the person who wrote the name of the maker to identify the mark failed to write his own name as a witness, the effect of the failure did not destroy the signature by mark but placed the burden of proving the mark was made as the maker’s signature upon the proponent of the writing.

        A court of equity will not cancel an unpaid mortgage at the suit of the mortgagor when it is given as part of a compromise settlement of pending litigation and when to do so would vary the provisions of the executed compromise settlement on the technical claim of invalidity of the method of affixing the signature.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A cardinal rule of statutory construction is that supreme court is to construe provisions in the code with a view to effecting their objectives. In Interest of C.J.A., 473 N.W.2d 439, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        The term “cause of action” in the statute of limitations is not used in a technical but in a special sense according to which a cause of action accrues when the holder thereof first obtains the right to resort to the particular form of action for relief. Colonial &amp; United States Mtg. Co. v. Northwest Thresher Co., 14 N.D. 147, 103 N.W. 915, 70 L.R.A. 814, 116 Am. St. Rep. 642, 8 Am. Ann. Cas. 1160 (1905), decided prior to the enactment of Chapter 5, p. 9, of the 1905 Laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the construction of the statute giving a farm laborer a lien for wages, the term “farm laborer” is construed according to the common understanding as to its meaning. Lowe v. Abrahamson, 18 N.D. 182, 119 N.W. 241, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        The view that where the grounds for a new trial are specified by statute, such statutory enumeration is exclusive, and a new trial can be granted only for the causes prescribed by the statute is in harmony with the rule of construction provided by this section. Higgins v. Rued, 30 N.D. 551, 153 N.W. 389, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1915), Gohl v. Bechtold, 37 N.D. 141, 163 N.W. 725, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D. 1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        A subsequent statute revising the whole subject matter of former enactments and intended as a substitute, repeals the former, but the original statutes may be resorted to in aid of construction in case of doubt. Klingensmith v. Siegal, 57 N.D. 768, 224 N.W. 680, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 324</cite> (N.D. 1929).

        The Sales Tax Act of 1935 covered the entire sales tax field and the court would not draw upon the common law to add to the statute a method of collection or supply a right of priority which the legislature did not provide. In re White, 69 N.D. 61, 284 N.W. 357, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1939).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The statute relating to the giving of notice of intention to redeem from a chattel mortgage sale was designed to enable persons interested in the property to protect themselves against unfair dealings; and, since its purpose was highly beneficent, like all remedial legislation, it should receive a liberal construction. Brown v. Smith, 13 N.D. 580, 102 N.W. 171, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        A remedial statute was to be liberally construed, even without this section. Scott v. District Court, 15 N.D. 259, 107 N.W. 61, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 31</cite> (N.D. 1906).

        When a statute abrogating a rule or principle of the common law is repealed, the common-law principle or rule is, ipso facto, revived, unless there is something to show a contrary intent on the part of the legislature. Burleigh County v. Rhud, 23 N.D. 362, 136 N.W. 1082, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1912); Reeves &amp; Co. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the statute authorizing extension of the redemption period after foreclosure of a lien upon realty was in derogation of the common law, the court was not required to give strict construction to the statute. Lillegard v. Hutchinson, 67 N.D. 44, 269 N.W. 43, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1936).

        In construing a statute, consideration must be given to the ordinary sense in which words are used, the context in which they are placed, and the background for the enactment as far as that can be ascertained from the whole act. Harding v. Dickinson, 76 N.D. 71, 33 N.W.2d 626, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1948).

        In interpreting a statute, words must be given their plain, ordinary and commonly understood meaning, and consideration should be given to the ordinary sense of statutory words, the context in which they are used, and the purpose which prompted their enactment. Coldwell Banker-First Realty v. Meide &amp; Son, 422 N.W.2d 375, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       </p>
       <p>
        When the plain language of a statute is not “transparent,” our codified rules of statutory interpretation direct us to look to the code itself in determining the meaning of statutory terms.

        District court clearly erred in concluding the obvious occurrence exception within N.D.C.C. § 28-01-46 applied because the alleged professional negligence was not within the knowledge of a layperson; under the rule of ejusdem generis, when the general words were construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects specifically enumerated the occurrence alleged was not like the failure to remove a foreign substance or performance of a medical procedure upon the wrong patient.

        Where there was no long-established, practical construction by city commission of the phrase “uncovered porch,” and the controlling ordinance provision was unambiguous, there was no need to give deference to city’s construction of it.

        Where a municipal ordinance provided that the revenues generated by the municipal water supply improvements surtax shall be expended exclusively to make improvements to the municipal water supply and further provided that in determining when to terminate the surtax, the Finance Director was directed to take into account the earnings likely to be derived from the tax proceeds set aside to make future cash payments during such time as it is possible to accomplish such set-aside, the city’s construction of its ordinance in such a way as to allow it to place interest accumulated from Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS) Project revenues into the general fund, instead of the NAWS fund created by the ordinance, was unreasonable, as interest clearly constitutes revenues and earnings and the language used could not reasonably be construed to permit interest earnings on surtax receipts to be expended for purposes other than improvements to the city’s water supply. If the city intended to allow interest on surtax receipts to be expended for other things when it drafted the ordinance, it would have used less inclusive terms than revenues and earnings.
   GO Comm. v. City of Minot, 2005 ND 136, 701 N.W.2d 865, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 2005).

        Where a municipal ordinance provided that revenues generated by the municipal water supply improvements surtax shall be expended exclusively to make improvements, defined in the ordinance as any measure that enhances the city’s water supply, including treatment facilities, to the municipal water supply through the Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS) Project or, failing that, through any prudent and reasonable means to the same end, the city’s construction of the ordinance was reasonable as its use of revenues generated by the water supply improvements surtax to improve its water treatment plant fell within the range of reasonableness within which a municipality’s exercise of discretion will not be interfered with or upset by the judiciary.

        In interpreting a township’s ordinance that prohibited the planting of trees 120 feet from the centerline of a road, the supreme court interpreted the ordinance as it would any statute, and the supreme court concluded that tree farmers’
   trees were planted for agricultural purposes; therefore, the trees were excluded from the ordinance.

        Words or phrases explained, or defined by statute are to be understood as thus explained, or defined. It is a well-settled rule of statutory construction that criminal statutes are strictly construed in favor of the defendant and against the government. State v.

        Defendant’s conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver was not subject to enhancement under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.19.html#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-23" target="_blank">19-03.1-23</a></cite>.1(1)(a) as this statute provided an offense enhancement only for the manufacture and distribution of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school. The inclusion of manufacture and distribution in this provision implied that possession with intent to deliver was excluded. Furthermore, possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver could not have “involved” distribution of a controlled substance by the defendant, because the defendant had not yet distributed it; instead, only circumstances that indicated an intent to deliver the controlled substance existed.

        District court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss, because under N.D.C.C. § 29-03-05, Burleigh County had authority to prosecute alleged offenses that the parties admitted occurred on the Burleigh County side of the center of the main channel of the Missouri River, or within five hundred yards of the boundary; the plain language of N.D.C.C. §§ 11-01-09 and 11-01-31, established the boundary between Morton County and Burleigh County to be through the center of the main channel of the Missouri River.

        District court erred in finding that the testator’s missing will was not presumed to be revoked, because while N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-07 did not speak to admitting a lost will and neither N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-14-03 nor 30.1-15-02 provided specific presumptions for admitting a missing will, the drafter’s of the Uniform Probate Code did contemplate the probate of lost wills, and the district court erroneously failed to apply the common law amino revocandi presumption that a missing will was revoked; if a will could not be found upon the death of the testator, the presumption arose that the testator revoked the missing will, and under N.D.R.Ev. 301(a), the party seeking to probate the missing will must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the testator did not destroy or revoke the missing will animo revocandi.

        The term “cause of action” in the statute of limitations is not used in a technical but in a special sense according to which a cause of action accrues when the holder thereof first obtains the right to resort to the particular form of action for relief. Colonial &amp; United States Mtg. Co. v. Northwest Thresher Co., 14 N.D. 147, 103 N.W. 915, 70 L.R.A. 814, 116 Am. St. Rep. 642, 8 Am. Ann.

        The statute giving a “farm laborer” a lien will be construed in accordance with the ordinary meaning of that term to the effect that a farm laborer is one who labors upon a farm in raising crops or doing general farm work. Lowe v. Abrahamson, 18 N.D. 182, 119 N.W. 241, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1908).

        A general statutory definition applies to the terms “gross negligence” and “willful misconduct” within the meaning of the automobile guest statute, in the absence of a definition of such terms therein. Jacobs v. Nelson, 67 N.D. 27, 268 N.W. 873, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ordinary, natural meaning of “descendant” used in the statute specifying exemptions from the estate tax, is the lineal issue, a person who proceeds from the body of another, as a child or grandchild. ESTATE OF LAMB, 72 N.D. 42, 4 N.W.2d 585, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether or not the word “may” as used in a statute is to be construed as mandatory or permissive in meaning depends upon the context and the circumstances under which it is used. Novak v. Novak, 74 N.D. 572, 24 N.W.2d 20, 1946 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The ordinary meaning of “lineal descendant” did not apply in the construction of the former non-lapse statute, former N.D.C.C. § 56-04-20, where it was being considered in connection with adopted children; the adoption law indicated that adopted children came within the meaning of the term “lineal descendants”. Heollinger v. Molzohn, 77 N.D. 108, 41 N.W.2d 217, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1950).

        It had to be presumed that at the time of the enactment of former N.D.C.C. § 15-53-18, the legislature was cognizant of the common, ordinary meaning attached to the word “incorporated”. Kiner v. Well, 71 N.W.2d 743, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1955).

       </p>
       <p>
        The word “any” is a general word and may have a diversity of meanings, its meaning in any particular case depending largely on the context and subject matter of the statute or instrument in which it is used. However, the word “any” in statutes is generally used in the sense of “all” or “every” and its meaning is comprehensive in scope and inclusive in range. State v. Zueger, 459 N.W.2d 235, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        N.D.C.C. § 65-02-11 is construed to require an element of reasonableness in determining the scope of the phrase “anything necessary” in order to avoid unreasonable or absurd consequences.

       <p>
        Commonly understood meaning of the word “teacher” in N.D.C.C. § 15.1-06-16, making it a crime to threaten a teacher, included a woman who was working as a teacher’s aide but who was licensed as a teacher, was the only figure in authority in the classroom, and was preparing a lesson at the time defendant threatened her. Therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to acquit under N.D.R.Crim.P. 29.

        In a case where the claimant sought a determination of an ownership interest in a tract of land, the trial court had to determine the “due date” for paying on the contract for deed, as that term was set forth in the relevant statute of limitations regarding contracts for deeds, N.D.C.C. § 28-01-42, in order to determine whether the claimant had filed the action on a contract for deed within the 10-year limitations period. In determining the meaning of that phrase, the trial court was obligated by N.D.C.C. § 1-02-02 to look at the statute’s language to determine the legislature’s intent and give those words their plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning, was obligated under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07 to construe that statute as a whole and harmonize its meaning to related provisions, could not consistent with N.D.C.C. § 1-02-05 disregard the letter of the statute under the pretext of pursuing its spirit if the statute’s language was clear and unambiguous, and could look to N.D.C.C. § 1-02-39’ s list of extrinsic aids for construing ambiguous statutes.
   Locken v. Locken, 2011 ND 90, 797 N.W.2d 301, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 2011).

       <p>
        Pursuant to statutory construction principles under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-02, N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07, and N.D.C.C. § 1-02-05, the soybean seller was not entitled to consideration of the soybean seller’s motion to vacate an arbitration award, as that motion had not been filed within the mandatory 90-day time limit for challenging such awards set forth in N.D.C.C. § 32-29.3-23(2). That conclusion was true even though the soybean purchaser filed a motion to confirm 70 days after the award was entered, as nothing in the statute on the confirmation of awards, N.D.C.C. § 32-29.3-22, indicated that the filing of a motion to confirm was meant to toll the 90-day time period for filing a motion to vacate.

        N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 precluded the City of Fargo, North Dakota, a home rule city, from imposing fees for noncriminal traffic offenses that exceeded the limits set forth for equivalent violations in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-06, because N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 clearly and unambiguously precludes a home rule city from superseding criminal or noncriminal offenses defined by State law, when a penalty that exceeds the limits delineated by equivalent State law supersedes State law; the word “offense” rather than the word “crimes” is used in the text of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05, and an “offense” under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 includes noncriminal, as well as criminal offenses.

        In determining whether the adopted woman was a proper devisee of the estate of decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father who predeceased the decedent, courts pursuant to
   N.D.C.C. § 1-02-03 had to give terms that defined the relationship between people their peculiar and appropriate meaning as defined by statute. Since the decedent’s child under
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(4) was the biological son and the adopted woman was the biological father’s “issue” under
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(22), the fact of the adopted woman’s adoption by the adoptive father did not effect the relationship between the adopted woman and biological father, according to
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-09(1), and meant that the adopted woman was a proper devisee of decedent.

        The words and phrases used in a statute should be considered in their relation to each other and according to the rules of grammar. The statute should be construed as a whole and with a view to arriving at the intent of the legislature. Anderson v. Peterson, 78 N.D. 949, 54 N.W.2d 542, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, that language cannot be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing the legislative intent because the intent is presumed to be clear from the face of the statute. However, if the statutory language is ambiguous or of doubtful meaning, courts may look to extrinsic aids to interpret the statute. District One Republican Comm'n v.

        Where a municipal ordinance provided that the revenues generated by the municipal water supply improvements surtax shall be expended exclusively to make improvements to the municipal water supply and further provided that in determining when to terminate the surtax, the Finance Director was directed to take into account the earnings likely to be derived from the tax proceeds set aside to make future cash payments during such time as it is possible to accomplish such set-aside, the city’s construction of its ordinance in such a way as to allow it to place interest accumulated from Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS) Project revenues into the general fund, instead of the NAWS fund created by the ordinance, was unreasonable, as interest clearly constitutes revenues and earnings and the language used could not reasonably be construed to permit interest earnings on surtax receipts to be expended for purposes other than improvements to the city’s water supply. If the city intended to allow interest on surtax receipts to be expended for other things when it drafted the ordinance, it would have used less inclusive terms than revenues and earnings.

        In interpreting a township’s ordinance that prohibited the planting of trees 120 feet from the centerline of a road, the supreme court interpreted the ordinance as it would any statute, by harmonizing the zoning ordinance with another ordinance exempting agricultural purposes from zoning ordinances and a regulation including “tree farming” in the definition of “agriculture”. The township erred in interpreting its ordinances to apply to a tree farmer’s trees; the trees were agricultural, and they were excluded from the ordinance.

        Defendant’s conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver was not subject to enhancement under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.19.html#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-23" target="_blank">19-03.1-23</a></cite>.1(1)(a) as this statute provided an offense enhancement only for the manufacture and distribution of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school. The inclusion of manufacture and distribution in this provision implied that possession with intent to deliver was excluded. Furthermore, possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver could not have “involved” distribution of a controlled substance by the defendant, because the defendant had not yet distributed it; instead, only circumstances that indicated an intent to deliver the controlled substance existed.

        In a case where the claimant sought a determination of an ownership interest in a tract of land, the trial court had to determine the “due date” for paying on the contract for deed, as that term was set forth in the relevant statute of limitations regarding contracts for deeds, N.D.C.C. § 28-01-42, in order to determine whether the claimant had filed the action on a contract for deed within the 10-year limitations period. In determining the meaning of that phrase, the trial court was obligated by N.D.C.C. § 1-02-02 to look at the statute’s language to determine the legislature’s intent and give those words their plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning, was obligated under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07 to construe that statute as a whole and harmonize its meaning to related provisions, could not consistent with N.D.C.C. § 1-02-05 disregard the letter of the statute under the pretext of pursuing its spirit if the statute’s language was clear and unambiguous, and could look to N.D.C.C. § 1-02-39’ s list of extrinsic aids for construing ambiguous statutes.

        Reviewing courts, in reviewing a trial court’s statutory interpretation, were tasked under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-05 with applying the legislature’s intent and were required under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07 to give conflicting statutory provisions effect unless the conflict was irreconcilable, in which case the special statutory provision had to control as an exception to the general statutory provision except in those cases where the legislature enacted a general statutory provision later and manifestly intended that the general provision prevail. Where another chapter or title conflicted, the provisions of the chapter or title at issue had to prevail, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07, as to all matters in question arising thereunder out of the same subject matter and, thus, the trial court could not apply the three-year limitations period of N.D.C.C. § 32-12.1-10 to bar the lessees’
   contract claims against the political subdivision, as the legislature intended that statute to apply only against tort claims against the state, which was separate from the political subdivision for liability purposes.

        Pursuant to statutory construction principles under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-02, N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07, and N.D.C.C. § 1-02-05, the soybean seller was not entitled to consideration of the soybean seller’s motion to vacate an arbitration award, as that motion had not been filed within the mandatory 90-day time limit for challenging such awards set forth in N.D.C.C. § 32-29.3-23(2). That conclusion was true even though the soybean purchaser filed a motion to confirm 70 days after the award was entered, as nothing in the statute on the confirmation of awards, N.D.C.C. § 32-29.3-22, indicated that the filing of a motion to confirm was meant to toll the 90-day time period for filing a motion to vacate.

      Whenever a general provision in a statute is in conflict with a special provision in the same or in another statute, the two must be construed, if possible, so that effect may be given to both provisions, but if the conflict between the two provisions is irreconcilable the special provision must prevail and must be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision is enacted later and it is the manifest legislative intent that such general provision shall prevail.

In determining the meaning of that phrase, the trial court was obligated by N.D.C.C. § 1-02-02 to look at the statute’s language to determine the legislature’s intent and give those words their plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning, was obligated under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07 to construe that statute as a whole and harmonize its meaning to related provisions, could not consistent with N.D.C.C. § 1-02-05 disregard the letter of the statute under the pretext of pursuing its spirit if the statute’s language was clear and unambiguous, and could look to N.D.C.C. § 1-02-39’ s list of extrinsic aids for construing ambiguous statutes.

        The rule is especially applicable where the statute, if given a retrospective operation, would be invalid as impairing the obligation of contracts or interfering with vested rights. E. J. Lander &amp; Co. v. Deemy, 46 N.D. 273, 176 N.W. 922, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1920); First Nat'l Bank v. Bovey, Shute &amp; Jackson, 49 N.D. 450, 191 N.W. 765, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1922); Marks v. Mandan, 70 N.D. 434, 296 N.W. 34, 1940 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        An act or statute does not have to contain the word “retroactive” to have retroactive application; an act or statute will be applied retroactively if its language shows a legislative intent that it be so applied. Ohlsen v. J.S. (In the Interest of W.M.V.), 268 N.W.2d 781, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section applies to all statutes enacted by the legislature regardless of whether they are substantive or procedural. Reiling v. Bhattacharyya, 276 N.W.2d 237, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is but a canon of statutory construction to aid in interpreting statutes to ascertain legislative intent. It is not an end in itself. Like any rule of construction, this section is subservient to the goal of statutory interpretation: to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. State v. Cummings, 386 N.W.2d 468, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 311</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes generally are not retroactive unless expressly declared so by the legislature. State v. Rodriguez, 454 N.W.2d 726, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is not to be blindly followed if there is evidence the legislature intended retrospective application. State v. Davenport, 536 N.W.2d 686, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no need to resort to this section to discern legislative intent when a court could rationally infer from a review of legislative history that the legislature intended retroactive application of a statute. Smith v. Baumgartner, 2003 ND 120, 665 N.W.2d 12, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Distinction between substantive and procedural statutes for retroactivity purposes has not been resuscitated, and if a statute is to be retroactive, the Legislature must expressly declare it to be so, as made plain by the language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t01c1-02s1-02-10" target="_self">1-02-10</a></cite>.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Statutes are not retroactive unless expressly declared so by the Legislature; an exception should be made to this general rule, however, in the case of ameliorating penal legislation. State v. Cummings, 386 N.W.2d 468, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 311</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cummings exception to the general bar of retroactivity applies where an ameliorating penal amendment imposes a lesser penalty for an offense. The exception does not require the State to retroactively apply an essential element of the offense to a defendant’s case, as the Cummings exception applies only to a situation where a lesser penalty is imposed, not where the legislature creates an additional element to the offense. Defendant is properly charged with a crime when the charging document alleges each and every essential element of the offense in effect on the date the crime occurred.

        The use of the phrase “shall have been sustained” in an amendment of the Workmen’s Compensation Act authorizing claims for compensation and the recovery of damages where injury or death occurred under circumstances creating liability on the part of a third person does not give the amendment retrospective effect in view of the use of the same phrase, with like context, in the original act.

       <p>
        The legislative history of N.D.C.C. § 31-13-03 showed that it applied retroactively to inmates already incarcerated for certain crimes; thus, defendant, who was incarcerated for felony murder in 1992 and at the time of enactment of the statute, was subject to the law and the court was required to order him to submit a DNA sample pursuant to the statute. State v. Norman, 2003 ND 66, 660 N.W.2d 549, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       <p>
        District court erred when it applied the 2005 version of N.D.C.C. § 28-01-46 in effect on the commencement date of a patient’s action since the applicable law in malpractice actions was the law in effect when the cause of action arose. Unless the amendments to § 28-01-46 were retroactive, the district court should have used the date the cause of action accrued in its analysis rather than the commencement date of the action, and nothing in the statute suggested the amendments were intended to apply retroactively; because the injury date occurred on February 10, 2004, and the statute was not retroactive, the 1997 version of § 28-01-46 should have been applied.

       <p>
        Appellate court overruled the assertion that the 2005 version of the Uniform Parentage Act applied, because the law in effect in 1993, the year the original paternity adjudication proceeding was commenced applied to the father’s motion for a DNA test to dispute a 1994 adjudication of paternity; not only did the 2005 legislation not say it applied retroactively, it specifically provided that it did not.

        Contrary to the husband's argument, the district court properly concluded that N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.14.html#t14c14-05s14-05-24" target="_blank">14-05-24</a></cite>.1(3) did not apply to cohabitation that occurred prior to August 1, 2015, and as a result, any cohabitation the wife may have engaged in prior to that date did not count toward the requirement for terminating spousal support based on cohabitation.

       Election challengers who were challenging a school district reorganization election six years earlier could not obtain declaratory relief under N.D.C.C. § 32-23-06, N.D.C.C.§ 32-23-01, and N.D.C.C. § 32-23-02 since the election mooted the issue of its validity. Under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-12, uniform statutes had to be read uniformly and declaratory relief was unavailable because there was no longer a controversy.

        In a case in which plaintiffs sought to quiet title to a mineral interest, the district court, which concluded that plaintiffs’
   mailing of the notice of lapse of mineral interest was not timely, properly applied N.D.C.C. § 1-02-15 and a prior version of N.D.C.C. § 1-03-05 when it granted summary judgment to defendants.

        Regardless of whether the state supreme court applied statutory law, namely N.D.C.C. § 1-02-15, or the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure, the insurance company, limited partnership, and rental company timely served their summons and complaint on the elevator company in a case where they alleged claims for negligence and strict liability for the damage allegedly caused to their apartment building by the elevator company’s elevator. Under both approaches, the first day was excluded and the last day was included, although the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure technically controlled the analysis because N.D.R.Civ.P. 1 stated that the rules governed the procedure in all civil actions and proceedings in the trial court and N.D.R.Civ.P. 3 more specifically governed the commencement of a civil action, which meant that the rule for computing time in the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure rather than a statute had to be used to determine whether a timely action was commenced.

        The repeal to which the statute refers is a repeal of an existing law by means of legislative enactment because it specifically recognizes that the act which repeals a repealing act may contain provisions which would obviate the rule of anti-reviver prescribed by the section.

     <p>
      The repeal of any statute by the legislative assembly, or by the people through an initiated law, does not have the effect of releasing or extinguishing any penalty, fine, liability, or forfeiture incurred under such statute, but as to cases tried before, or subsequent to, the repeal of such statute, it has the effect of extinguishing any jail or prison sentence that may be, or that has been, imposed by reason of said law, unless the repealing act provides expressly that the penalties of imprisonment shall remain in force as to crimes committed in violation of such law prior to its repeal. In other respects, such act shall remain in force only for the purpose of the enforcement of such fine, penalty, or forfeiture.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The incorporation into and reenactment of certain statutes without material change, in the general revision of the laws in 1895, did not operate as a new enactment of them but only as a continuation thereof, and such statutes were to be construed as though such revision had not been made. Wells County v. McHenry, 7 N.D. 246, 74 N.W. 241, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 1898); Sargent County v. Cooper, 29 N.D. 281, 150 N.W. 878, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        A statute which was a recodification in the 1943 Code, rather than a new enactment, was to be considered as a continuation of the existing statute, and in such cases there was a presumption that the codifiers did not intend to change the law as it previously existed. Schmutzler v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 78 N.D. 377, 49 N.W.2d 649, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1951); Hutchinson v. Charles, 75 N.W.2d 313 (1956).

        Where the legislature, in declaring what the printed volumes of the 1943 Code should contain, made provision for historical annotation, it was a clear indication that the prior history of the statutes incorporated in the codification might be consulted as an aid in their interpretation.

        There is no evidence in the succession statutes of a legislative intent that the word “issue” does not include an adopted child and the sections relating to adoption do not limit the right of an adopted child to inherit from his natural parents under the succession statutes. Bannerman v. Close, 81 N.W.2d 259 (N.D. 1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the estate representative contesting the finding that the adopted woman was a proper devisee of decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father, claimed that the trial court should have applied North Dakota’s Revised Uniform Adoption Act,
   N.D.C.C. § 14-15-14 (Adoption Act), on the effects of a decree of adoption,
   N.D.C.C. § 1-02-27 dictated that because the North Dakota Uniform Probate Code (Uniform Probate Code) conflicted with Adoption Act and governed the specific issue of identifying proper devisees, the Uniform Probate Code had to be applied. As a result, the adopted woman could be found to be a proper devisee despite the fact that result might not have occurred had the Adoption Act been applied.

        Applying the provisions of N.D.C.C. §§
   1-02-05, 1-02-07 and 1-02-27, the trial court could not apply the three-year limitations period of N.D.C.C. § 32-12.1-10 to bar the lessees’
   contract claims against the political subdivision, as the legislature intended that statute to apply only against tort claims against the state, which was separate from the political subdivision for liability purposes.

        In essence, this state’s statutory scheme declares that, as a matter of public policy, a mortgagor of property over a certain number of acres is entitled to a one-year period of redemption upon foreclosure. The right to a one-year redemption period cannot be waived by a provision in the mortgage declaring that the Short-Term Act will govern. First State Bank v.

        Workers Compensation.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A worker currently receiving benefits has a significant property right in continuation of those benefits, and an expectation those benefits will continue; the right to receiving continuing workers compensation disability benefits by a worker already receiving them is a property right subject to due process protection. Gregory v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 94, 578 N.W.2d 101, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a benefit claimant’s total disability was determined prior to the 1989 and 1993 effective dates of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-05s65-05-09" target="_blank">65-05-09.</a></cite>2, the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) was unable to offset the claimant’s retirement benefits against his workers compensation disability benefits due to the claimant’s reliance interest in benefits and the obligation to pay by WSI. However, attorney fees and costs were not awarded since WSI did not act without substantial justification under the standard utilized in the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C.S. § 2412 because at least one judge agreed with the position advanced by WSI and it was a close question regarding unsettled law.

        Sexually dangerous individual is defined under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) as an individual who is shown to have engaged in sexually predatory conduct and who has a congenital or acquired condition that is manifested by a sexual disorder, a personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction that makes that individual likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct which constitute a danger to the physical or mental health or safety of others. Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has held that commitment as a sexually dangerous individual is unconstitutional unless the person is found to have serious difficulty controlling his or her behavior; therefore, consistent with N.D.C.C. § 1-02-38(1), the definition of a sexually dangerous individual is construed to require a connection between the disorder and dangerousness, including evidence showing the person has serious difficulty controlling his behavior, which distinguishes a sexually dangerous individual from other dangerous persons.

        Debt servicing company’s services were not illegal under N.D.C.C. § 13-06-02 because the company was not engaged in “debt adjusting” as defined in N.D.C.C. § 13-06-01, as it did not distribute money to the debtors’
   creditors; rather, it negotiated settlements with the creditors, and its agreement with the debtors provided that the debtors would make all settlement payments directly to the creditors. The court rejected a Chapter 7 trustee’s argument that the “or” in the second sentence of the definition of debt adjusting meant that a person engaged in debt adjusting whether or not that person received money from the debtor and distributed the same to the debtor’s creditors, as the trustee’s interpretation of the statute would render a portion of the first sentence—that “debt adjusting” included as a part of its definition the distribution of money among creditors— inoperative.

        Among the extrinsic aids useful in construing an ambiguous statute to determine legislative intent are the object sought to be attained, legislative history, and administrative construction of the statute. Reed v. Hillsboro Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 9, 477 N.W.2d 237, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        In construing ambiguous statutes, the court considers the legislative history, the purpose and object of the statute, and the laws upon the same subject. Walker v. Schneider, 477 N.W.2d 167, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The administrative construction of a statute by the agency administering the law is entitled to deference if that interpretation does not contradict clear and unambiguous statutory language. Western Gas Resources v. Heitkamp, 489 N.W.2d 869, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 920, 113 S. Ct. 1281, 122 L. Ed. 2d 675, 1993 U.S. LEXIS 1261 (U.S. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court applied rules of statutory construction to interpret two administrative regulations, N.D. Admin. Code § 75-02-04.1-03 and N.D. Admin. Code § 75-02-05.1-08.2; after reviewing the legislative history and legislative intent, the conclusion was reached that the offset provisions of the two regulations applied to parents’
   child support obligations when one parent assigned the right to receive child support to the State as reimbursement for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families benefits received.
   Simon v. Simon, 2006 ND 29, 709 N.W.2d 4, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 31</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>
        If a rule of court is ambiguous, the court may resort to extrinsic aids, including the rule’s historical development, to construe it. State v. Lamb, 541 N.W.2d 457, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 1996).

         Extrinsic Aids.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If the language of a statute is ambiguous or of doubtful meaning, extrinsic aids may be used to interpret the statute. Extrinsic aids which may be used to determine legislative intent include the laws upon the same or similar subjects and the consequences of a particular construction. Kim-Go, H.K. Minerals, Inc. v. J.P. Furlong Enters., Inc., 460 N.W.2d 694 (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, that language cannot be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing the legislative intent because the intent is presumed to be clear from the face of the statute. However, if the statutory language is ambiguous or of doubtful meaning, courts may look to extrinsic aids to interpret the statute. District One Republican Comm'n v. District One Democrat Comm'n, 466 N.W.2d 820, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a statute is ambiguous, it is the duty of this court to ascertain the legislature’s intent in enacting the statute. The court may resort to extrinsic aids, such as legislative history, to construe an ambiguous provision. Kallhoff v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 484 N.W.2d 510, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        When interpreting ambiguous statutes, this court may consider pertinent extrinsic evidence. That evidence may include legislative history, the object of the statute, and the consequences of a particular construction. Kroh v. American Family Ins., 487 N.W.2d 306, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where the claimant sought a determination of an ownership interest in a tract of land, the trial court had to determine the “due date” for paying on the contract for deed, as that term was set forth in the relevant statute of limitations regarding contracts for deeds, N.D.C.C. § 28-01-42, in order to determine whether the claimant had filed the action on a contract for deed within the 10-year limitations period. In determining the meaning of that phrase, the trial court was obligated by N.D.C.C. § 1-02-02 to look at the statute’s language to determine the legislature’s intent and give those words their plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning, was obligated under N.D.C.C. § 1-02-07 to construe that statute as a whole and harmonize its meaning to related provisions, could not consistent with N.D.C.C. § 1-02-05 disregard the letter of the statute under the pretext of pursuing its spirit if the statute’s language was clear and unambiguous, and could look to N.D.C.C. § 1-02-39’ s list of extrinsic aids for construing ambiguous statutes.
   Locken v. Locken, 2011 ND 90, 797 N.W.2d 301, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon remand of the case to the trial court, the trial court under the authority of N.D.C.C. § 1-02-39 could consider the factors listed in that statute to determine the appropriate limitations period to be applied to the lessees’
   contract claims against the political subdivision. The trial court needed to do so because it applied the wrong limitations period to determine that the contract claims were barred against the political subdivision, especially given the legislature’s intent under N.D.C.C. § 32-12.1-01 that claims against political subdivisions be treated separately from claims against the state, that tort claims as recognized by the factors set forth in N.D.C.C. § 32-12.1-02, that state tort liability was separate from political subdivision liability as contemplated under N.D.C.C. § 32-12.2-01, and that the legislature had provided a “catch-all” limitations provision for actions against only against the state and its employees under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-01s28-01-22" target="_blank">28-01-22.</a></cite>1.

        When construing an ambiguous statute to ascertain the legislature’s intent, the court can consider extrinsic evidence, including the legislative history of the statute. City of Fargo v. Ness, 529 N.W.2d 572, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 41</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s issuance of an additional 90-day forced medication order following a hearing on the matter did not violate N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.25.html#t25c25-03.1s25-03.1-18" target="_blank">25-03.1-18.</a></cite>1(3), because legislative history clearly reflected the intention of the 1993 amendments to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.25.html#t25c25-03.1s25-03.1-18" target="_blank">25-03.1-18.</a></cite>1(3), was not to place a limitation on the number of 90-day forced medication orders that could be issued, but was to require a court hearing before an extension could be granted rather than allowing an extension based only on the report of a psychiatrist.
   Pryatel v. T.E. (In re T.E.), 2007 ND 166, 740 N.W.2d 100, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the statutory language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.26.1.html#t26.1c26.1-40s26.1-40-15" target="_blank">26.1-40-15.</a></cite>4(1) construed with the other provisions for underinsured motorist coverage and the legislative history addressing the purpose of those statutes, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.26.1.html#t26.1c26.1-40s26.1-40-15" target="_blank">26.1-40-15.</a></cite>4(1) required the reduction for benefits paid or payable under any Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) law from the insured’s total compensable damages and not from the insured’s underinsured motorist coverage limit, because making insureds whole was furthered by construing the reducing language of N.D.C.C. § 26.1-40-15.4(1) to authorize a reduction from compensatory damages rather than from the underinsured motorist coverage limit as long as the insured did not duplicate recovery for the same loss, and that purpose would be frustrated for WSI benefits since WSI had a subrogation right against a tortfeasor for fifty percent of the damages recovered up to a maximum of the total amount it has paid or would otherwise pay.

        A township election day is not a holiday. State v. Currie, 8 N.D. 545, 80 N.W. 475, 1899 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1899).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since the statute is construed as mandatory as to time provisions, the time within which nominations must be filed is not changed by the fact that the thirtieth day before election falls on Sunday. State ex rel. Anderson v. Falley, 9 N.D. 464, 83 N.W. 913, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        In court practice, where the last day for performance falls on Sunday, and where the time within which the act to be done is measured by days, generally, performance can be made on the Monday following. The same rule applies to a case involving the redemption period before a mortgage foreclosure sale. Styles v. Dickey, 22 N.D. 515, 134 N.W. 702, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

      Those portions of government lot two in the northeast quarter, section twenty-nine, township one hundred forty north, range forty-eight west and the northeast quarter, section seven, township one hundred thirty-nine north, range forty-eight west of the fifth principal meridian, county of Clay, state of Minnesota, bounded by the thread of the Red River of the North as it existed prior to January 1, 1959, and the new thread of the Red River of the North as established by the United States army corps of engineers under Project CIVENG-21-018-59-22, containing respectively nine and seventy-eight hundredths and twelve and seventy-six hundredths acres [3.95 and 5.16 hectares] more or less,
     </p>
     <p>
      detached from the state of Minnesota and attached to the state of North Dakota. The state of North Dakota, upon passage by the legislature of the state of Minnesota of the necessary enabling legislation, does hereby accept jurisdiction over the above-described property, which property shall thereafter be a part of the state of North Dakota and title thereof shall be vested in the city of Fargo, North Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing contained in the provisions of this section shall be construed in such manner as to prejudice the title, right, or claim of any person to any of the lands herein involved. The recorder of Cass County, North Dakota, shall accept and record, without charge therefor, patents, deeds, or other evidences of ownership or interest in any lands recorded in Clay County, Minnesota, which were previously a part of the state of Minnesota but are now within the boundaries of the state of North Dakota. Recordings made under the provisions of this section have retroactive effect to the date of their original recording in the state of Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      The act of the legislature of the state of Minnesota referred to in this section, together with this section, shall constitute the agreement between the states of Minnesota and North Dakota. The Congress of the United States, upon passage of such acts by the respective legislatures of the states of Minnesota and North Dakota, is petitioned, pursuant to article 1, section 10, clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, to give its consent to this agreement and to amend the enabling acts of such states accordingly. The secretary of state of North Dakota shall transmit duly certified copies of this act to the presiding officers of the senate and house of representatives of the United States and to the several senators and representatives of the states of Minnesota and North Dakota in the Congress of the United States, who are petitioned to take such action as they deem proper to procure the consent of the Congress of the United States to this agreement between the states of Minnesota and North Dakota. This agreement shall become effective when it has been ratified and approved by the legislatures of the states of Minnesota and North Dakota and approved by the Congress of the United States.
