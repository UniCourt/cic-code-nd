      The articles of uniform code of military justice governing the armed forces of the United States as codified in the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 2019 edition, are a part of this title so far as the articles are applicable and not modified by any provision of this title. An individual who commits an offense while on military duty status, including state active duty, may be tried by a court-martial lawfully appointed even after the duty has terminated, and if found guilty, the accused must be punished according to the articles of uniform code of military justice and the rules and regulations governing the armed forces of the United States, within the limits prescribed in this title and by federal law for the courts-martial in the national guard. In any case in which the individual alleged to have committed the offense could be charged either under the code of military justice or the civil law of this state, the officer whose duty it is to approve the charge, in the officer’s discretion, may order the person charged or subject to being charged to be turned over to the civil authorities for trial. Commanders may administer nonjudicial punishment for offenses while on military duty status, including state active duty, in accordance with part V, Manual for Courts-Martial, except the service member may not demand a trial by courts-martial. When reference is made to the articles of uniform code of military justice, to the military service, or to the armed forces of the United States, the reference must be deemed to include the military service of this state. Laws of this state affecting the military forces must be construed to conform to all acts and regulations of the United States affecting the same subjects.

      Members of the national guard or militia ordered into the active service of the state by any proper authority are not civilly nor criminally liable for any act or acts done by them in the line of duty. Members of the national guard or militia ordered into active service of the state must be presumed to be acting in the line of duty except in the case of willful misconduct or gross negligence. When a suit or proceeding is commenced in any court against an officer of the militia for any act done by such officer in the officer’s official capacity in the discharge of any duty under the provisions of this title, or against any person acting under the authority or order of any such officer or by virtue of any warrant issued by any such officer pursuant to law, the defendant is entitled to legal representation provided by the attorney general, an assistant attorney general, or a judge advocate officer at no cost. The defendant in such action may require the person prosecuting or instituting the suit or proceeding to file security for the payment of the costs that may be awarded to the defendant therein. The defendant in all such cases may make a general denial and give the special matter in evidence. If the action is dismissed or a verdict or judgment is rendered against the plaintiff, the defendant shall recover treble costs in the action.

     </h3>
     <p>
      No body of people, other than the regularly organized units of the national guard and militia and the troops of the United States, may associate themselves together as a military company or organization or parade in public with firearms, and no municipality may raise or appropriate any money toward arming or equipping, uniforming or in any other way supporting, sustaining, or providing drillrooms or armories for, any such body of people. Associations wholly composed of soldiers honorably discharged from the service of the United States and members of the order of sons of veterans may parade in public with firearms on Decoration Day, upon the reception of any regiment or company of soldiers returning from service, or for the purpose of escort duty at the burial of deceased soldiers. Students in educational institutions where military science is a prescribed part of the course of instruction, with the consent of the governor, may drill and parade with firearms in public under the superintendence of their teachers. This section does not prevent any organization authorized to do so by law from parading with firearms nor prevent parades by the national guard of other states. Any person violating any provision of this section is guilty of a class B misdemeanor.

       A “veteran” is an individual who has served on continuous federalized active military duty for one hundred eighty days or the full period for which the individual was called or ordered to active military duty for reasons other than training, and who was discharged or released under other than dishonorable conditions.

       A “wartime veteran” is an individual who served in the active military forces, during a period of armed conflict or who received the armed forces expeditionary or other campaign service medal during an emergency condition and who was discharged or released under other than dishonorable conditions. “Wartime veteran” also includes an individual who died in the line of duty in the active military forces, as determined by the armed forces.

     <p>
      Every commissioned officer of the national guard is entitled to receive from this state, while engaged in any service ordered by the governor, pay and allowances at the rate allowed by law to officers of similar rank and length of service in the United States army. If ordered to active duty by the governor in response to an emergency management assistance compact request and if the requesting state pays state active duty pay at a higher rate than this state, the commissioned officer is entitled to the higher rate of pay. Each commissioned officer of the national guard is entitled to receive a state active duty pay enhancement of three hundred dollars for every month spent on state active duty or a prorated amount for each day of state active duty up to three hundred dollars per month. The adjutant general and deputy assistant adjutant general when receiving salary from the state and not on active duty in a federal status are entitled to receive such compensation as may be appropriated by the legislative assembly for that purpose, provided that when the adjutant general receives compensation from the government of the United States as director of selective service, such compensation must be deducted from the compensation otherwise due the adjutant general from the state and the adjutant general may be paid from state funds only the difference, if any, between the compensation from the United States and the compensation provided in this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any officer of the national guard who has federal recognition removed due to age, as proscribed by federal law, must be placed on the retired list by the governor. Any officer who has served as such under a commission in the military service of this state for a continuous period of eight years may be placed, at the officer’s own request, upon the retired list with an advance in grade and withdrawn from active service and command by the governor. A commissioned officer must be withdrawn from active service and placed upon the retired list whenever the officer becomes disabled and incapable of performing the duties of the officer’s office. A commissioned officer, upon the recommendation of the officer’s commanding officer or of an inspecting officer, must be placed by the governor upon the retired list whenever the officer becomes unfit or incompetent for service and thereby incapable of performing the duties of the officer’s office. The governor, however, may not order the retirement of an officer until the provisions of section 37-04-17 have been complied with. Vacancies in the commissioned personnel of the national guard caused by the operation of this section must be filled in the same manner as other vacancies in the commissioned personnel are filled.

      Before the governor shall make an order placing an officer on the retired list on the ground that such officer is disabled, unfit, or incompetent, the governor shall appoint a board of not less than five commissioned officers, one of whom must be a surgeon, to investigate and report on the matter. Such board shall determine the facts as to the nature and cause of the incapacity of the officer who appears to be disabled, unfit, or incompetent from any cause to perform military service, and whose case shall be referred to it. Before entering upon the discharge of a member’s duties, each member of the board must be sworn to an honest and impartial performance of the person’s duties as a member of the board. No officer whose grade or promotion would be affected by the decision of such board in any case that may come before it may participate in the examination or decision in such case. The board has the powers of courts of inquiry and courts-martial, and whenever it finds an officer incapacitated for active service, it shall report such fact to the governor, stating the cause of incapacity, whether from disability, unfitness, or incompetency. If the governor approves the finding of the board, the officer must be placed upon the retired list as provided in this chapter. No officer may be placed upon the retired list by the action of such board without having had a full and fair hearing before the board if, upon due notice, that officer demands it. It is not necessary to refer any case for the action of the board unless the officer designated to be placed upon the retired list, within twenty days after being notified that the officer will be so retired, serves on the adjutant general a notice in writing that the officer demands a hearing and examination before such board.

     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to recognize the vital role of the national guard in the state. While the national guard is subject to federal control during periods of national emergency, it is organized, trained, and equipped to perform military functions and to aid civil authorities in the protection of life and property while it is subject to the control of the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to encourage voluntary membership in the guard, improve the educational level of its members, and thereby benefit the state as a whole.

A special court-martial may try any person, except a commissioned officer, subject to the military law, for any crime or offense made punishable by the military laws of the United States, and has the same powers of punishment as a general court-martial except that fines imposed by a special court-martial may not exceed three hundred dollars and a sentence of confinement may not exceed one hundred days. A bad conduct discharge may not be adjudged unless a complete record of the proceedings and testimony has been made, counsel was detailed to represent the accused, and a military judge was detailed to the trial.

       In addition to disaster or emergency mitigation measures as included in the state and local disaster or emergency operational plans, the governor shall consider, on a continuing basis, steps that could be taken to mitigate or reduce the harmful consequences of disasters or emergencies. At the governor’s direction, and pursuant to any other authority and capability they have, state agencies charged with responsibilities in connection with floodplain management, stream encroachment and flow regulation, weather modification, fire prevention and control, air quality, public works, land use and land use planning, and construction standards, shall make studies of disaster or emergency mitigation-related matters. The governor, from time to time, shall make recommendations to the legislative assembly, local governments, and other appropriate public and private entities as may facilitate measures for mitigation or reduction of the harmful consequences of disasters or emergencies.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c37-17.1s37-17.1-11ol12">
       The water commission and department of water resources, in conjunction with the division of homeland security, shall keep land uses and construction of structures and other facilities under continuing study and identify areas that are particularly susceptible to severe land shifting, subsidence, flood, or other catastrophic occurrence. The studies under this subsection must concentrate on means of reducing or avoiding the dangers caused by severe land shifting, subsidence, flood, or other catastrophic occurrence, or the consequences of severe land shifting, subsidence, flood, or other catastrophic occurrence.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c37-17.1s37-17.1-11ol13">
       If the division of homeland security determines, in coordination with lead and support agencies, on the basis of the studies or other competent evidence, that an area is susceptible to a disaster of catastrophic proportions without adequate warning; existing building standards and land use controls in that area are inadequate and could add substantially to the magnitude of the disaster or emergency; and changes in zoning regulations, other land use regulations, or building requirements are needed in order to further the purposes of this section, it shall specify the essential changes to the governor. If the governor, upon review of the determination, finds after public hearing, that the changes are essential, the governor shall so recommend to the agencies or local governments with jurisdiction over that area and subject matter. If no action or insufficient action pursuant to the governor’s recommendations is taken within the time specified by the governor, the governor shall so inform the legislative assembly and request legislative action appropriate to mitigate the impact of the disaster or emergency.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c37-17.1s37-17.1-11ol14">
       The governor, at the same time that the governor makes recommendations pursuant to subsection 3, may suspend the standard or control which the governor finds to be inadequate to protect the public safety and by regulation place a new standard or control in effect. The new standard or control remains in effect until rejected by concurrent resolution of both houses of the legislative assembly or amended by the governor. During the time it is in effect, the standard or control contained in the governor’s regulation must be administered and given full effect by all relevant regulatory agencies of the state and local governments to which it applies. The governor’s action is subject to judicial review in accordance with chapter 28-32 but is not subject to temporary stay pending litigation.

       Persons within this state shall conduct themselves and keep and manage their affairs and property in ways that will reasonably assist and will not unreasonably detract from the ability of the state and the public to effectively prevent, mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from a disaster or emergency. This obligation includes appropriate personal service and use or restriction on the use of property in time of disaster or emergency. This chapter neither increases nor decreases these obligations but recognizes their existence under the Constitution of North Dakota and statutes of this state and the common law. Compensation for services or for the taking or use of property must be only to the extent that obligations recognized herein are exceeded in a particular case and then only to the extent that the claimant may not be deemed to have volunteered that person’s services or property without compensation.

    PURPOSE AND AUTHORITIES
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states. For the purposes of this agreement, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, manmade disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states’ national guard forces, either in accordance with the national guard mutual assistance compact or by mutual agreement between states.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        ARTICLE II
    GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.
      </p>
      <p>
       On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.

      <p>
       <b>
        1.
       </b>
       Nothing in this compact may be construed as a waiver of any benefits, privileges, immunities, or rights otherwise provided for national guard personnel performing duty pursuant to title 32 of the United States Code nor may anything in this compact be construed as a waiver of coverage provided for under the Federal Torts Claims Act. In the event that national guard personnel performing counter-drug activities do not receive rights, benefits, privileges, and immunities otherwise provided for national guard personnel as stated above, the following provisions apply:
      </p>

       Officers and enlisted personnel of the national guard performing duties subject to proper orders pursuant to this compact are subject to and governed by the provisions of their home state code of military justice whether they are performing duties within or without their home state. In the event that any national guard member commits, or is suspected of committing, a criminal offense while performing duties pursuant to this compact without that member’s home state, that member may be returned immediately to that member’s home state and said home state is responsible for any disciplinary action to be taken. However, nothing in this section abrogates the general criminal jurisdiction of the state in which the offense occurred.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds that effective radio communication is vital to public safety and effective emergency response and law enforcement and declares that a statewide integrated radio communication system will more effectively serve the goals of law enforcement and emergency response personnel and thereby better serve the people of North Dakota. Existing radio systems operated by local jurisdictions serve those jurisdictions adequately, but do not provide the protection and benefits to the citizens of North Dakota that new digital networks being utilized in neighboring states offer.

        The veterans’ preference statute places the burden on the employer to establish that the veteran was not qualified; however, the statute does not require that the veteran be informed of the employer’s reasons for finding the veteran unqualified prior to the hearing, or that the employer is precluded from presenting evidence at the hearing that the veteran was not qualified.

        Where, in an administrative hearing to determine whether or not an applicant had been given veterans’ preference as required by this section, there was considerable evidence that the qualifications listed in a newspaper advertisement were not in accord with the required qualifications for the position as envisioned by the School District and the Department of Public Instruction; the record supported the hearing officer’s finding that the qualifications for the positions were those enumerated in the job description rather than those in the newspaper advertisement.

        The court cannot read into this statute the intent to deny an agency the power to act beyond the fifteen-day time restriction should exigencies require it to do so. Lippert v. Grand Forks Pub. Sch. Dist., 512 N.W.2d 436, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>
        District court properly denied a veteran's petition for a writ of mandamus compelling the sheriff's office to mail him notice that his request for employment as a deputy sheriff in 2008 had been refused because the veteran was aware someone else was given the position, continued to work for sheriff's office as a special deputy, waited nearly eight years after the interview to inquire why he was refused employment, and provided no reasonable excuse for the delay.

        The apparent purpose of this section is to ensure proper enforcement of the veterans’ preference by affording aggrieved veterans the opportunity to be heard and by permitting the hiring body to attempt to demonstrate that its hiring process complied with the statutory directive.

      A private, nonpublic employer in this state may provide a preference to a veteran for employment.

     <p>
      In order to ease the financial hardships and personal and family sacrifice sustained by members of the North Dakota national guard, and North Dakota residents of the reserve, and active duty component who were mobilized after December 5, 1992, in support of military operations around the world it is the intent of the legislative assembly that additional compensation be provided to those resident veterans of North Dakota and payment of that compensation is declared to be a public purpose. It is the further intent of the legislative assembly to encourage those North Dakota resident veterans to continue their voluntary membership in the national guard, reserve component, and active military force.

       Subsection 1 of section 37-29-03 is not applicable if the employer is a state agency, an agency of a political subdivision, or a private entity that performs critical emergency services during a disaster or emergency, and the employer’s executive officer determines the absence of an employee who is also a volunteer emergency responder will cause undue hardship or the inability of the employer to provide critical emergency services during a disaster or emergency. Under this subsection the executive officer shall:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t37c37-29s37-29-04ol11a">
         Make all reasonable efforts to inform an employee who is a volunteer emergency responder that the employment services that employee performs are essential and therefore that employee’s absence from the workplace will be unauthorized if the employee is called to report for duty as a volunteer emergency responder.

Under this subsection the executive officer shall:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t37c37-29s37-29-04ol12a">
