       May require a new assessment of property in any county to be made in accordance with chapter 57-14, whenever that is deemed necessary, or may require county auditors to place on the assessment rolls property which may be discovered and which has not been taxed according to law. For purposes of this subsection, “new assessment” means a new assessment as defined in section 57-14-08.

       May maintain an accounting system that includes a special category of accounts designated as noncurrent accounts. The noncurrent accounts must be those accounts that are uncollectible as a matter of law or those accounts in which all reasonable collection efforts over a period of six years have produced no results. After examination by the state auditor, and upon the state auditor’s recommendation for cause, specific accounts may be removed by the commissioner from noncurrent status and all records pertaining thereto immediately destroyed.

       May waive, upon a showing of good cause, any and all tax due. A lien must have been filed against the debtor’s property prior to the request for a waiver. The attorney general shall approve the waiver. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, if a debtor and the internal revenue service enter into an offer in compromise pursuant to section 7122 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 7122], as amended, the tax commissioner may reduce a debtor’s individual income tax liability. However, if the federal offer in compromise, for any reason, is subsequently declared void by the internal revenue service, the debtor is liable for the original amount of tax due.

         May allow a taxpayer to elect to pay the tax liability to the state no later than the date the payment is required by law to be made in funds which are immediately available to the state on the date of payment. An election to pay the tax under this subdivision is binding until the taxpayer applies to the tax commissioner to rescind the election. Payment in immediately available funds may be made by wire transfer of funds through the federal reserve system or by any other means established by the commissioner which ensures the availability of the funds to the state on the date of payment. Evidence of the payment must be furnished to the commissioner on or before the due date of the tax as established by law. Failure to timely make the payment in immediately available funds or failure to provide evidence of payment in a timely manner subjects the taxpayer to penalty and interest as provided by law for delinquent or deficient tax payments.

        Administrative officers of the state cannot estop the state through mistaken statements of the law; therefore, a taxpayer was liable for additional taxes, penalties and interest where it relied on incorrect advice from the director of sales and special taxes, and from the tax commissioner.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state tax commissioner shall appoint a state supervisor of assessments who must be a person trained and experienced in property appraisals and familiar with assessment and equalization procedures and techniques. The state supervisor of assessments serves at the pleasure of the state tax commissioner and office space must be furnished to the state supervisor of assessments by the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state supervisor of assessments shall perform the following duties under the direction of the tax commissioner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-01s57-01-05ol11">
       The state supervisor of assessments shall advise and give assessors the necessary instructions and directions as to their duties under the laws of this state, to promote uniform assessment of property in this state.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-01s57-01-05ol12">
       The state supervisor of assessments shall assist and instruct assessors in use of soil surveys, land classification methods, preparation and proper use of land maps and record cards, proper classification of real and personal property, and determination of proper standards of value.

       The state supervisor of assessments may make sales, market, and productivity studies and other studies of property assessments in the counties and cities of this state to properly advise the assessors and directors of tax equalization in the state and to recommend to the tax commissioner changes to be made by the state board of equalization in the performance of its equalization powers and duties. In any sales, market, and productivity study made according to section 57-01-06, the county directors of tax equalization or city assessors shall compile a record of sales of property made in the county or city, and in conjunction with the board of county commissioners shall analyze the sales for the purpose of advising the state supervisor of assessments as to the value of using the sales in any such study. The compilations must be forwarded to the state supervisor of assessments with the findings of the county director of tax equalization, city assessors, and the board of county commissioners. In any county or city or any part thereof where the number of sales of properties is insufficient for making a sales, market, and productivity study, the county director of tax equalization or city assessor, as the case may be, in cooperation with the state supervisor of assessments or that person’s assistants shall make appraisals of properties in order to determine the market value.
      </li>

Expenses incurred by a county to fulfill the duties of a township or city assessment official whose certificate has been suspended or revoked must be charged to the political subdivision in which the certificate holder is employed and must either be paid directly to the county by the political subdivision or deducted by the county treasurer from funds coming into the treasurer’s control which are apportionable to the subdivision.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislative assembly that local assessors, county directors of tax equalization, and city, township, county, and state boards of equalization use the results of sales, market, and productivity studies as a guide in making assessments and in equalizing assessments of property in this state. The legislative assembly recognizes that sales of property alone provide insufficient information to make accurate judgments concerning the market value of property within the various counties of this state, particularly in view of the limited number of sales which occur within a given period of time in many counties, and that, in order to get an accurate picture of market value, consideration must be given to such factors as property appraisals, productivity, and current usage of property.

       In any case in which the provisions of any tax law are administered by the tax commissioner and the tax is collected by the tax commissioner or the amount thereof is certified by the tax commissioner to any other official for collection and the law providing for such tax authorizes the tax commissioner to assess or determine a tax liability that is in addition to that reported by the taxpayer, the taxpayer has a right to a hearing before the tax commissioner on such assessment or determination and has a right to appeal to the courts from the decision of the tax commissioner on such hearing and all of the provisions of chapter 28-32 relating to proceedings before an administrative agency, including the right to appeal to the courts from the decision of the tax commissioner in such a proceeding, are applicable to and govern the notice of hearing, the hearing, and the right of appeal from the tax commissioner’s decision thereon. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law heretofore or hereafter enacted, it is the intent and purpose of this section to provide that in those circumstances hereinbefore described every taxpayer shall have both the right to a hearing before the tax commissioner and the right to appeal to the courts from the tax commissioner’s decision on such hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 28-32 unless the provisions of any such law expressly provide that the decision of the tax commissioner is final or expressly provide that the provisions of chapter 28-32 are not applicable.

If the tax commissioner receives information that the tax was under-assessed, the additional amount of tax that is determined to be due may be assessed by the tax commissioner, notwithstanding the fact that the assessment made by the tax commissioner is final and nonreviewable.

        A school district is a municipality for purposes of N.D.C.C. tit. 57, by virtue of subdivision (9) of this section. Therefore, there is a range of reasonableness within which a school district’s manner and means of exercising its powers will not be interfered with or upset by the judiciary. Reed v. Hillsboro Pub.

       <p>
        Subdivision 15 does not confine determination of value to any single consideration and there is no statutory reason why taxing authorities cannot employ replacement and reproduction cost methods; the statute allows consideration of “all other matters that affect the actual value of the property to be assessed,” and with appropriate adjustments for age and condition, replacement analysis can be an appropriate method to value improvements and structures. Taxing authorities are not tied down to earnings or transactions as select measures of value, although they are obvious references for appraising unimproved real estate. Ulvedal v. Board of County Comm'rs, 434 N.W.2d 707, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of tax assessment, the degree of economic obsolescence in a national industry cannot be arbitrarily measured by an opinion based on statistics of production and of processing capacity in North Dakota, rather than on reasons relevant to the entire industry. National Sun Indus. v. Ransom County, 474 N.W.2d 502, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        County board of commissioners’ denial of application for abatement of real estate taxes was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, where the record reflected that assessors considered the income history and earning capacity of the property as required, and the assessment of the true and full value of the property was not incompatible with the parties’ original tax increment financing agreement about the market value of the property. Trollwood Village Ltd. Ptnr. v. Cass County Bd. of County Comm'rs, 557 N.W.2d 732, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 272</cite> (N.D. 1996).

    Abbreviations used in land descriptions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Abbreviations used in describing real estate may be as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol11">
       In all proceedings, lists, advertisements, records, notices, and documents relative to assessing, advertising, or selling real estate for taxes or special assessments, it is sufficient to describe such real estate by the use of initial letters, abbreviations, and figures to designate the township, range, section, or part of section, and the number of a lot or block.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol12">
       Whenever the letters N., E., S., or W. are used, they must be construed to mean north, east, south, and west, respectively.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol13">
       Whenever there are used the initial letters N.W., S.W., N.E., or S.E., whether in capital letters or small letters, and whether each letter is followed by a period or the two are written connectedly without a period to signify the same to be an abbreviation of two words, and whenever said letters are used in connection with section numbers to designate land descriptions, and in the absence of proof to the contrary, it must be presumed that the same are abbreviations for and mean “northwest”, “southwest”, “northeast”, and “southeast”, respectively.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol14">
       When two or more sets of such abbreviations are used connectedly, as for example N.E. S.E., the same must be presumed to mean the “northeast quarter of the southeast quarter”.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol15">
       When any such initial letters are followed with a numeral placed in the position of an algebraic exponent, as N.W.4, S.W.4, N.E.4, or S.E.4, with the figure placed on or above the line, the description must be taken to mean the “northwest quarter”, “southwest quarter”, “northeast quarter”, or “southeast quarter”, respectively. The abbreviation N.2, S.2, E.2, or W.2 must be presumed to mean the “north half”, “south half”, “east half”, or “west half”, respectively, of the section or quarter or other portion of land designated immediately following it.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol16">
       Combinations of such letters and figures must be read accordingly, as S.2 N.E.4 must be taken as intended to mean and describe the “south half of the northeast quarter”, and similar combinations of such letters and exponents must be construed accordingly.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol17">
       In the absence of such figure placed in the position of an exponent, whenever abbreviations N.W., S.W., N.E., or S.E. are used alone or with similar abbreviations, they must be presumed to mean and be read as “northwest quarter”, “southwest quarter”, “northeast quarter”, or “southeast quarter”, respectively, unless it appears clearly from the context that another meaning is intended.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol18">
       The abbreviation sec. must be taken as meaning “section”, the letters “t” or “twp” or “tp” must be taken to mean “township”, the letters “r” or “rg” or “rge” must be taken to mean “range”, the abbreviations “b” or “blk” or “bk” must be taken to mean “block”, the abbreviations “add” or “ad” must be taken to mean “addition”, and the abbreviations “sub” or “subd” must be taken to mean “subdivision”.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol19">
       The abbreviation “do” or the characters “ " ” or other similar abbreviation or character, must be construed to mean the same name, word, initial, letter, abbreviation, or figure as the last preceding one written or the one written immediately above.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-02ol110">
       No description in which the foregoing abbreviations, symbols, initial letters, figures, or characters definitely can be understood by the application of the definitions and rules in this section may be held defective because such abbreviations are used instead of words or figures symbolized thereby.

        Items which pertain to the use of structures and buildings are those items which are used directly in and solely for effectuating that particular purpose to which the taxpayer has employed its structures and buildings. Ladish Malting Co. v. Stutsman County, 351 N.W.2d 712, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 309</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Movability of property must be considered in determining whether an item is real or personal property for tax purposes; items which can be removed without rendering the structure or building nonfunctional, without extensive repair or redesign of the structure or building, and without replacement of removed items satisfy the requirement that personal property be “removable without materially limiting or restricting the use of such structures or buildings”, but where physical or economic considerations so negate movement as a matter of practicability, the property should be found to be real property. Ladish Malting Co. v. Stutsman County, 351 N.W.2d 712, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 309</cite> (N.D. 1984).

       <p>
        The intent of this section is to define real property for tax purposes so as to exclude those items which pertain to the use of structures and buildings (such as machinery or equipment used for trade or manufacture), and which are not constructed as an integral part of and are not essential for the support of such structures or buildings, and which are removable without materially limiting or restricting the use of such structures or buildings. Ladish Malting Co. v. Stutsman County, 351 N.W.2d 712, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 309</cite> (N.D. 1984).

        The term “agricultural lands” as used in subsection 15 is descriptive of land itself and is used merely to distinguish rural from urban or other properties. EISENZIMMER v. BELL, 75 N.D. 733, 32 N.W.2d 891, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 99</cite> (N.D. 1948); Boehm v. Burleigh County, 130 N.W.2d 170, 1964 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1964).

        Where eighty-acre tract owned by wife qualified by itself as agricultural land, and where it was also part of larger unit of land which was managed as farm by her husband who resided with her on the smaller eighty-acre tract, she was entitled to the tax exemption provided by this chapter, notwithstanding that her husband had additional income from a full-time job in the city.

    Conditional property tax exemption for owners of wetlands.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Wetlands qualifying under this section are exempt from taxation. To qualify for the tax exemption, the owner of wetlands must annually file with the county director of tax equalization, on a form prescribed by the state tax commissioner, a legal description of the wetlands for which an exemption is claimed and an agreement to not drain, fill, pump, or concentrate water in a smaller and deeper excavation in the wetland basin or alter the physical nature of the wetland in any manner that reduces the wetland’s ability to function as a natural system during the year for which the exemption is claimed. To qualify for the exemption the agreement must be filed by June thirtieth of the year for which the exemption is claimed. The exemption is not available for years prior to filing of the agreement or for any year in which the terms of the agreement are violated. The county director of tax equalization shall certify to the county auditor, for each landowner receiving the exemption, the landowner’s name, the amount of tax which would have been due on the exempt acreage for the most recent past tax year, and that the landowner has filed the required agreement. The amount of the wetlands exemption must be reflected upon the property tax statement of each eligible taxpayer.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purposes of this section, “wetlands” means all types 3, 4, and 5 wetlands, as determined by the agriculture commissioner and the director of the game and fish department, in accordance with United States fish and wildlife service circular no. 39 (1971 edition), drainage of which would be feasible and practical.
     </p>
     <p>
      When wetlands are drained or altered so the land no longer qualifies for the exemption provided by this section, the land is subject to additional taxes which would have been assessed if the property had not qualified for the exemption provided by this section. The taxes which would have been due on the land without the exemption for the ten years preceding the year in which the exemption is terminated must be computed, and the property owner shall pay the difference between this amount and the taxes which were actually paid on the property in addition to taxes currently due. Absence of water on property qualifying for the exemption under this section, caused by drought conditions, does not disqualify the property from the exemption under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The wetlands tax exemption provided by this section does not grant the public any additional or greater right of access to the wetlands or diminish any right of ownership to the wetlands. The owner of property exempt under this section may use the property in any manner which does not violate the agreement filed with the county director of tax equalization.
     </p>
     <p>
      No property is exempt under this section unless the tax commissioner has certified to the county auditor of each county by December tenth of the taxable year that funds are available in the state treasury which may be used for payment in full of any state obligations under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-02s57-02-08" target="_self">57-02-08.</a></cite>5.

      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The resulting amounts must be known as the taxable valuation. In determining the assessed value of real and personal property, except agricultural property, the assessor may not adopt a lower or different standard of value because the same is to serve as a basis of taxation, nor may the assessor adopt as a criterion of value the price at which said property would sell at auction, or at forced sale, or in the aggregate with all the property in the town or district, but the assessor shall value each article or description by itself, and at such sum or price as the assessor believes the same to be fairly worth in money. In assessing any tract or lot of real property, there must be determined the value of the land, exclusive of improvements, and the value of all taxable improvements and structures thereon, and the aggregate value of the property, including all taxable structures and other improvements, excluding the value of crops growing upon cultivated lands. In valuing any real property upon which there is a coal or other mine, or stone or other quarry, the same must be valued at such a price as such property, including the mine or quarry, would sell for at a fair voluntary sale for cash. Agricultural lands within the corporate limits of a city which are not platted constitute agricultural property and must be so classified and valued for ad valorem property tax purposes until such lands are put to another use. Agricultural lands, whether within the corporate limits of a city or not, which were platted and assessed as agricultural property prior to March 30, 1981, must be assessed as agricultural property for ad valorem property tax purposes until put to another use. Such valuation must be uniform with the valuation of adjoining unannexed agricultural land.

      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-27.24ol11">
       “True and full value” of agricultural lands must be their agricultural value for the purposes of sections 57-02-27, 57-02-27.1, 57-02-27.2, and 57-55-04. Agricultural value is defined as the “capitalized average annual gross return”, except for inundated agricultural land. The “annual gross return” must be determined from crop share rent, cash rent, or a combination thereof reduced by estimated property taxes and crop marketing expenses incurred by farmland owners renting their lands on a cash or crop share basis.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-27.24ol12">
       For purposes of this section, “annual gross return” for cropland used for growing crops other than sugar beets and potatoes means thirty percent of annual gross income produced, “annual gross return” for cropland used for growing sugar beets and potatoes means twenty percent of annual gross income produced, and “annual gross return” for land used for grazing farm animals means twenty-five percent of an amount determined by the department of agribusiness and applied economics of North Dakota state university to represent the annual gross income potential of the land based upon the animal unit carrying capacity of the land.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-27.24ol13">
       The “average annual gross return” for each county must be determined as follows:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-27.24ol13a">
         Total the annual gross returns for the ten years immediately preceding the current year for which data is available and discard the highest and lowest annual gross returns of the ten.

        <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-27.24ol13b">
         The department of agribusiness and applied economics of North Dakota state university shall establish a base year index of prices paid by farmers using annual statistics on that topic compiled by the national agricultural statistics service for the seven-year period ending in 1995, discarding the highest and lowest years’ indexes, and averaging the remaining five years’ indexes. The department of agribusiness and applied economics shall gather the national agricultural statistics service annual index of prices paid by farmers for the ten years ending with the most recent year used under subdivision a, discard the highest and lowest years’ indexes, average the remaining eight years’ indexes, and divide the resulting amount by the base year index of prices paid by farmers. This amount must be divided into the amount determined under subdivision a.

       To find the “capitalized average annual gross return”, the average annual gross return must be capitalized by a rate that is a ten-year average of the gross agribank mortgage rate of interest for North Dakota. The ten-year average must be computed from the twelve years ending with the most recent year used under subdivision a of subsection 3, discarding the highest and lowest years, and the gross agribank mortgage rate of interest for each year must be determined in the manner provided in section 20.2032A-4(e)(1) of the United States treasury department regulations for valuing farm real property for federal estate tax purposes, except that the interest rate may not be adjusted as provided in section 20.2032A-4(e)(2).

       The department of agribusiness and applied economics of North Dakota state university shall compute annually an estimate of the average agricultural value per acre [.40 hectare] of agricultural lands on a statewide and on a countywide basis; shall compute the average agricultural value per acre [.40 hectare] for cropland, noncropland, and inundated agricultural land for each county; and shall provide the tax commissioner with this information by December first of each year. Fifty percent of the annual gross income from irrigated cropland must be considered additional expense of production and may not be included in computation of the average agricultural value per acre [.40 hectare] for cropland for the county as determined by the department of agribusiness and applied economics. Before January first of each year, the tax commissioner shall provide to each county director of tax equalization these estimates of agricultural value for each county.

      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-27.24ol16">
       For purposes of this section, “inundated agricultural land” means property classified as agricultural property containing a minimum of ten contiguous acres if the value of the inundated land exceeds ten percent of the average agricultural value of noncropland for the county, which is inundated to an extent making it unsuitable for growing crops or grazing farm animals for two consecutive growing seasons or more, and which produced revenue from any source in the most recent prior year which is less than the county average revenue per acre for noncropland calculated by the department of agribusiness and applied economics of North Dakota state university. Application for classification as inundated agricultural land must be made in writing to the township assessor or county director of tax equalization by March thirty-first of each year. Before all or part of a parcel of property may be classified as inundated agricultural land, the board of county commissioners must approve that classification for that property for the taxable year. The agricultural value of inundated agricultural lands for purposes of this section must be determined by the department of agribusiness and applied economics of North Dakota state university to be ten percent of the average agricultural value of noncropland for the county as determined under this section. Valuation of individual parcels of inundated agricultural land may recognize the probability that the property will be suitable for agricultural production as cropland or for grazing farm animals in the future. Determinations made under this subsection may be appealed through the informal equalization process and formal abatement process provided for in this title.

      <li id="t57c57-02s57-02-27.24ol17">
       Before February first of each year, the county director of tax equalization in each county shall provide to all assessors within the county an estimate of the average agricultural value of agricultural lands within each assessment district. The estimate must be based upon the average agricultural value for the county adjusted by the relative values of lands within each assessment district compared to the county average. In determining the relative value of lands for each assessment district compared to the county average, the county director of tax equalization shall use soil type and soil classification data from detailed and general soil surveys.

       Each local assessor shall determine the relative value of each assessment parcel within the assessor’s jurisdiction and shall determine the agricultural value of each assessment parcel by adjusting the agricultural value estimate for the assessment district by the relative value of the parcel. Each parcel must then be assessed according to section 57-02-27. If either a local assessor or a township board of equalization develops an agricultural value for the lands in its assessment district differing substantially from the estimate provided by the county director of tax equalization, written evidence to support the change must be provided to the county director of tax equalization. In determining the relative value of each assessment parcel, the local assessor shall apply the following considerations, which are listed in descending order of significance to the assessment determination:

       For any county that has not fully implemented use of soil type and soil classification data from detailed or general soil surveys by February first of any taxable year after 2011, the tax commissioner shall direct the state treasurer to withhold five percent of that county’s allocation each quarter from the state aid distribution fund under section 57-39.2-26.1 beginning with the first quarter of 2013, and continuing until the tax commissioner certifies to the state treasurer that that county has fully implemented use of soil type or soil classification data. The amount withheld from the allocation must be deposited into the agricultural land valuation fund. The amount withheld from the allocation must be withheld entirely from the portion of the allocation which may be retained by the county and may not reduce allocations to any political subdivisions within the county.

      The assessor shall perform the duties required of the office during the twelve-month period prior to April first in the manner provided in this section. The assessor shall determine both the true and full value as defined by law and the assessed value of each tract or lot of real property listed for taxation, and shall enter those values in separate columns, and the true and full value and assessed value of all improvements and structures taxable thereon in separate columns, opposite such description of property, and in another column shall show the total assessed value of the property by adding the totals of the two previous assessed value columns.

      In all assessment books and tax lists and in all proceedings for the collection of taxes and proceedings founded thereon, unplatted land and undeveloped land platted before March 30, 1981, not situated within the limits of an incorporated city must be described in subdivisions not exceeding quarter sections. Real property in the platted portion of a city or real property platted on or after March 30, 1981, that is located outside any city and is not agricultural property under the conditions set out in subsection 1 of section 57-02-01, must be assessed separately as to each lot. When a building or structure covers two or more contiguous lots or parts of lots owned by the same person the assessment may not be entered separately as to each lot or part of lot, but the tract upon which the building is located must be described and assessed as one parcel. A block which has not been subdivided may be described, assessed, and taxed in a unit of one block. A failure to comply with the provisions of this section does not impair the validity of taxes.

     <p>
      If any tract or lot of land is divided into irregular shapes which can be described only by metes and bounds, or if any addition or subdivision which already has been platted into blocks and lots and subsequently sold into parts of blocks or lots which can be described only by metes and bounds, or if the courses, distances, and sizes of each lot or fractional lot are not given or marked upon the plat so that the precise location of each lot and fractional lot can be ascertained accurately, surveyed, or laid out, the owner of such tract or tracts, upon the request of the county auditor, shall have such land platted or replatted, as the case may be, into lots or blocks according to deeds on record. If such plat cannot be made without an actual survey of the land, the same must be surveyed and platted and the plat thereof recorded. If the owners of any such tract refuse or neglect to cause such plat and survey, when necessary, to be made and recorded within thirty days after such request, the county surveyor, or some other competent surveyor, upon the request of the county auditor, shall make out such plat from the records of the recorder if practicable, but if it cannot be made from such records, then the surveyor shall make the necessary survey and plat thereof, and the county auditor shall have the same recorded, but no such plat may be recorded until approved by the city engineer of the city affected thereby, and if there is no city engineer, then by the county surveyor. A certificate of the approval of such plat must be made by the officer making the same endorsed on the plat or map. Such certificate also must be recorded and forms a part of the record. When such plat has been duly certified and recorded, any description of the property in accordance with the number and description set forth in such plat must be deemed a good and valid description of the lots or parcels of land so described. No such plat or description may bear the name or number which already has been applied to any plat or description previously made and recorded as a part of any such city. When the owner of such land fails to comply with the provisions of this section, the cost of surveying, platting, and recording must be paid by the county, upon allowance by the board of county commissioners, and the amount thereof must be added to the taxes upon such tracts or lots the ensuing year. Such taxes, when collected, must be credited to the county general fund. The surveyor making such survey or plat is entitled to receive for services in making the same the compensation allowed by law for doing other county surveying or platting, and such fees become a legal charge upon such tracts of land.

        A mortgage lien given to state as security for investment of permanent school fund is superior to liens for real estate taxes levied after recording of mortgage. State v. Griggs County, 72 N.D. 587, 10 N.W.2d 245, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1943).

        Ordinarily a lien for personal property taxes assessed against property in one class cannot be asserted on property in another class, but where there is a claim for personal property taxes asserted against all property subject to a chattel mortgage which is foreclosed by United States, without evidence to designate various classes, priority will be granted against all personal property of taxpayer.

        County tax lien was inferior to the State of North Dakota's mortgage interest on the property because the State's mortgage lien could not be inferior to a county tax lien, as (1) N.D.C.C. § 57-02-40 provided an exception to the priority of tax liens on real estate over the State's mortgage lien, and (2) the Bank of North Dakota (Bank), as an entity of the State of North Dakota, had a perfected interest in the property, which was prior to assessment of property taxes and the subsequent issuance of a tax lien.

     <p>
      All taxes, as between vendor and purchaser, become a lien on real estate on and after the first day of January following the year for which such taxes were levied. If taxable real property is acquired in any year after the assessment date by an owner in whose hands it will be exempt from taxation, the taxes on it for the portion of the year that it was not exempt, computed to the nearest month, constitute a personal charge against the person from whom it was acquired and all of the provisions of law for payment and collection of personal property taxes are applicable to such prorated taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      If exempt real property is acquired in any year after the assessment date by an owner in whose hands it is taxable, it must be assessed as omitted property and the taxes on it for that portion of the year that it is not exempt, computed to the nearest month, are subject to all of the provisions for payment and collection that are applicable to taxes for the same year on other real property.

       District court erred in affirming a decision by a board of county commissioners denying the owners' application for an abatement of 2013 real estate taxes for three parcels of land because the county board incorrectly applied the omitted property provisions, which resulted in increasing the valuation for each parcel by the same amount where the county conceded it failed to timely notify the owners of a local board of equalization meeting before increasing the 2013 assessments, the State Board of Equalization established a valuation for the 2013 assessments at the 2012 true and full values, and the county auditor was not authorized to use the omitted property statutes to revalue or circumvent the State Board's 2013 valuations.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly hereby declares and finds that the present method of assessment and taxation of real property discourages the investment of private capital in the rehabilitation and remodeling of commercial and residential buildings and structures with the result that such properties have been allowed by their owners to decay, become in need of repair, modernization, and replacement, and that such conditions have resulted in a decreased tax base. The legislative assembly further finds that it is in the public interest and for the welfare of the state of North Dakota, its political subdivisions, and its citizens to encourage the investment of private capital in improvements to commercial and residential buildings and structures, thereby encouraging the production of wealth, improving the volume of employment, enhancing living conditions, and preserving and increasing the property tax base. It is the intent of the legislative assembly that the exemptions from taxation provided for in this chapter provide an alternative to the property tax exemptions provided for in chapters 40-57 and 40-57.1.

An improvement for residential purposes is limited to a building or structure at least twenty-five years old. An addition constructed to an existing building or structure to enlarge it is an improvement for the purposes of this chapter.

     <p>
      Improvements to commercial and residential buildings and structures as defined in this chapter may be exempt from assessment and taxation for up to five years from the date of commencement of making the improvements, if the exemption is approved by the governing body of the city, for property within city limits, or the governing body of the county, for property outside city limits. The governing body of the city or county may limit or impose conditions upon exemptions under this section, including limitations on the time during which an exemption is allowed. A resolution adopted by the governing body of the city or county under this section may be rescinded or amended at any time. The exemption provided by this chapter shall apply only to that part of the valuation resulting from the improvements which is over and above the assessed valuation, exclusive of the land, placed upon the building or structure for the last assessment period immediately preceding the date of commencement of the improvements. Any person, corporation, limited liability company, association, or organization owning real property and seeking an exemption under this chapter shall file with the assessor a certificate setting out the facts upon which the claim for exemption is based. The assessor shall determine whether the improvements qualify for the exemption based on the resolution of the governing body of the city or county, and if the assessor determines that the exemption should apply, upon approval of the governing body, the exemption is valid for the prescribed period and shall not terminate upon the sale or exchange of the property but shall be transferable to subsequent owners. If the certificate is not filed as herein provided, the assessor shall regard the improvements as nonexempt and shall assess them as such.

     <p>
      Upon receipt of the decision of the state board of equalization, the board of university and school lands shall compute the payments due to the counties in which property subject to valuation is located by extending the mill levies that apply to taxable property in the taxing districts in which the property is located in the same manner as is used for other taxable property in the taxing districts. After computing the payments due to each county, the board of university and school lands shall, within the limits of legislative appropriations, remit to the counties the amounts due on or before March first of the year following the year for which the assessments were made.

      The revenue to which taxing districts are entitled under this chapter must be determined according to the proportion that the taxing district’s mill levy on other real property bears to the total mill levies of all taxing districts on other real property in the taxing districts in which the property subject to valuation is located. The revenue remaining after apportionment to the county must be apportioned and distributed by the county treasurer among the various taxing districts in which the property for which payments are made is located. The amount of revenue allocated to each taxing district in which property subject to valuation is located must be divided among the various funds of the district according to the proportion that the mill levy for any fund bears to the total of all mill levies of the taxing district.

      A city, for property within city limits, or a county, for property outside city limits, may impose crew housing permit fees that apply to crew housing facilities. Crew housing permit fees imposed by a city or county must be determined on the basis of the value of services and facilities provided to the crew housing facility by the city or county, or both. A city or county imposing fees under this section may share revenues from the fees with other taxing districts in which the property is located.

     <p>
      The state board of equalization, at its annual meeting in July in each year, shall assess, at its actual value on the first day of January of that year, the operating property, including franchises, of each railroad operated in this state, including any electric or other street or interurban railway. If any railroad allows any portion of its railway to be used for any purpose other than the operation of a railroad, the portion of its railway while so used must be assessed in a manner provided for the assessment of other real property. To enable the board to make a correct valuation of property, it shall have access to all reports, estimates, and surveys of a line of railroad on file in the office of the public service commission and has power to summon and compel the attendance of witnesses, and to examine witnesses under oath in any matter relating to the value of the property. In fixing the value of any railroad, and of branch lines and sidetracks, the board must be governed by the rules prescribed for county and township assessors in valuing other property in this state. The board shall make a record of the value placed by it upon the property of the railroad, including the valuation per mile [1.61 kilometers] of main line and of branch lines and sidetracks. Railroad property held in trust by the public service commission for purposes of reorganization or reopening of the railway line is exempt from assessment as provided in this section.

        The fact that value fixed by board of equalization is less than actual value in judgment of said board is not sufficient to invalidate such assessment, when record also shows there are grave doubts as to liability of property for taxation. Shattuck v. Smith, 6 N.D. 56, 69 N.W. 5 (N.D. 1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts may inquire into jurisdiction of board and set aside its determinations if made without, or in excess of, powers conferred upon it by law. Northern Pac. Ry. v. State, 71 N.D. 93, 299 N.W. 696 (1941), decided prior to the enactment of N.D.C.C. chapter 28-32.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is presumed that board’s valuation is its honest judgment and this presumption is binding on courts unless it is shown by clear and convincing proof that board was actuated by a fraudulent purpose, or that it acted in such illegal, wrongful, arbitrary or capricious manner as to constitute a fraud in law or an act in excess of its jurisdiction. Northern Pac. Ry. v. State, 71 N.D. 93, 299 N.W. 696 (1941), decided prior to the enactment of N.D.C.C. chapter 28-32; Great N. R. Co. v. Weeks, 297 U.S. 135, 56 S. Ct. 426, 80 L. Ed. 532, 1936 U.S. LEXIS 519 (U.S. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Overvaluation, being a mere error of judgment is not, of itself, sufficient to warrant an injunction against any part of taxes based on challenged assessment. Northern Pac. Ry. v. State, 71 N.D. 93, 299 N.W. 696 (1941), decided prior to the enactment of N.D.C.C. chapter 28-32.

        Neither tax commissioner nor board members can be compelled to submit to examination as to operation of their minds in making challenged assessment. Great N. Ry. v. Weeks, 297 U.S. 135, 56 S. Ct. 426, 80 L. Ed. 532 (1936).

     <p>
      The term “operative property” means any and all property that is not exempt under this chapter by reason of an election filed under chapter 57-33.2 and which is reasonably necessary for use by any company mentioned in section 57-06-02 exclusively in the operation and conduct of the particular kind of business engaged in by it. Any such property held under a contract for the purchase thereof must be considered for all purposes of taxation as the property of the company holding the same. Any such property, real or personal, held by any company under a rental lease must be assessed by the state board of equalization in the name of such company, if an agreement in writing between the owner thereof and such company is filed with the tax commissioner requesting that such leased property be so assessed. Whenever any property of a public utility company required to be assessed by the state board of equalization under the provisions of this chapter is used partly for operative purposes and partly for other purposes, either by the company or by others, all such property that is not exempt under this chapter by reason of an election filed under chapter 57-33.2 must be assessed by the state board of equalization as operative property of the company. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all oil or gas pipeline property that is not exempt from ad valorem taxation is subject to assessment by the state board of equalization under this chapter.

       <p>
        The tentative assessment which the legislature requires the tax commissioner to formulate is to “guide” the board, and is itself to be based on valuations made annually by the tax department. Koch Hydrocarbon Co. v. State, 454 N.W.2d 508, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The board is to be guided by the tentative assessment, but is not foreclosed from considering other factors. The tentative assessment, thus, is relevant evidence of the value of the operative property. Koch Hydrocarbon Co. v. State, 454 N.W.2d 508, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The characterization of the tax commissioner’s assessment as “tentative” does not mean that it is either inconsequential or unsupported. It means only that it is not conclusive. Koch Hydrocarbon Co. v. State, 454 N.W.2d 508, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1990).

      The property of a company assessed under the provisions of this chapter, for the purposes of assessment and taxation and the collection of taxes, must be considered personal property. The taxes assessed on such property are a perpetual paramount lien upon all the franchises and property, both real and personal, of every kind and nature belonging to the company assessed from and after the date upon which the assessment is made, and no sale or transfer of such property, or of any part thereof, divests, or in any way affects, the lien for the taxes upon such property. No company which has been assessed and taxed under the provisions of this chapter is entitled to have a transfer of any of its said property by deed, bill of sale, or otherwise entered, filed, or recorded upon the records of the office of the recorder, county treasurer, or county auditor, unless all taxes then due against the said property first are paid and satisfied. All laws not in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, relating to the enforcement of the payment of delinquent personal property taxes, are applicable to all taxes levied on such property pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and when any taxes levied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter become delinquent, the county treasurer charged with the duty of collecting such delinquent taxes shall proceed to collect the same in the manner now provided by law for the collection of delinquent personal property taxes. If collection is made by seizure and sale, the sale must be at public auction held at the county courthouse.

      If any company whose property has been valued and assessed for taxation purposes by the state board of equalization under the constitution or statutes of this state, or against whom any tax is levied or assessed by the board, feels aggrieved for any reason with the assessment, the company may bring an action in the district court of the county in which the company maintains its principal place of business in this state, against the state and any subdivisions of the state which may be interested, for relief therefrom. The action must be brought on or before the date on which the taxes to be collected under the assessment involved become due. Any adjustments to an assessment brought forward after October first must be applied to the following taxable year.

      At any time after an action is brought pursuant to section 57-08-01, the district court, either before or during trial, may allow the plaintiff to pay to the state or municipalities interested any part of the taxes involved in the action under such agreement as may be made between the plaintiff or plaintiffs and the attorney general on behalf of all defendants, or under such terms as the court may fix. Such agreement, when ratified by the court, is binding upon all parties to the action. At the time the action is brought, the plaintiff is required to file with the clerk of the district court a bond payable to the state of North Dakota, in such form as may be fixed by the district court, and in an amount sufficient to cover all anticipated costs of the action, said bond to be approved as to amount and form by the clerk of the district court. The decision of the district court in such action is subject to appeal to the supreme court in the manner now provided by statute for appeal in civil actions. No application need be submitted to the board of county commissioners before such action is commenced.

      The township board of equalization shall ascertain whether all taxable property in its township has been properly placed upon the assessment list and duly valued by the assessor. In case any real property has been omitted by inadvertence or otherwise, the board shall place the same upon the list with the true value thereof. The board shall proceed to correct the assessment so that each tract or lot of real property is entered on the assessment list at the true value thereof. The board may not increase the valuation returned by the assessor to an amount that results in a cumulative increase of more than fifteen percent from the amount of the previous year’s assessment without giving the owner or the owner’s agent reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard regarding the intention of the board to increase it. All complaints and grievances of residents of the township must be heard and decided by the board and it may make corrections as appear to be just. Complaints by nonresidents with reference to the assessment of any real property and complaints by others with reference to any assessment made after the meeting of the township board of equalization must be heard and determined by the county board of equalization. The board must comply with any requirement for notice of an assessment increase under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-02s57-02-53" target="_self">57-02-53.</a></cite>

     <p>
      At its meeting, the board of equalization shall proceed to equalize and correct the assessment roll. It may change the valuation and assessment of any real property upon the roll by increasing or diminishing the true and full valuation thereof as is reasonable and just to render taxation uniform, except that the board may not increase the valuation of any property returned by the assessor to an amount that results in a cumulative increase of more than fifteen percent from the amount of the previous year’s assessment without first giving the owner or the owner’s agent reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard regarding the intention of the board to increase it. All complaints and grievances of residents of the city must be heard and decided by the board and it may make corrections as appear to be just. Complaints by nonresidents with reference to the assessment of any real property and complaints by others with reference to any assessment made after the meeting of the city board of equalization must be heard and determined by the county board of equalization. The board shall comply with any requirement for notice of an assessment increase under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-02s57-02-53" target="_self">57-02-53.</a></cite>

    Spot checks of real property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Prior to the annual meeting of the county board of equalization, the board of county commissioners of each county within this state shall provide for spot checks upon property within each county to properly verify the accuracy of the real property listings and valuations. The spot checks must be reviewed by the county boards of equalization at their annual meeting in June and such boards shall make the necessary corrections in the property assessment listings and valuations. Such changes in the assessments must be made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case any person whose duty it is to list property with the assessor refuses to list such property or intentionally omits a portion of such property in the person’s listing as indicated by the spot check, the county boards of equalization, as a penalty for such refusal or omission, may make an added assessment on such property of twenty-five percent in excess of its true valuation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of county commissioners may select such persons or agencies as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section and provide for their compensation.

       Neither constitutional due process nor statutory provisions require the board to give notice to the various taxing districts before increasing or decreasing the value of all or a class of taxable property within the district.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state board of equalization shall equalize the valuation and assessment of property throughout the state, and has power to equalize the assessment, classification, and exemption status of property in this state between assessment districts of the same county, and between the different counties of the state. It shall:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol11">
       Equalize the assessment of real property by adding to the aggregate value thereof in any assessment district in a county and in every county in the state in which the board may believe the valuation too low, such percentage rate as will raise the same to its proper value as provided by law, and by deducting from the aggregate assessed value thereof, in any assessment district in a county and every county in the state in which the board may believe the value too high, such percentage as will reduce the same to its proper value as provided by law. City lots must be equalized in the manner provided for equalizing other real property.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol12">
       In making such equalization, add to or deduct from the aggregate assessed valuation of lands and city lots such percentage as may be deemed by the board to be equitable and just, but in all cases of addition to or deduction from the assessed valuation of any class of property in the several assessment districts in each county and in the several counties of the state, or throughout the state, the percentage rate of addition or deduction must be even and not fractional.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol13">
       In equalizing individual assessments:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol13a">
         If it believes an assessment to be too high, the board may reduce the assessment on any separate piece or parcel of real estate if the owner of the property has appealed such assessment to the board either by appearing personally or by a representative before the board or by mail or other communication to the board in which the property owner’s reasons for asking for the reduction are made known to the board.
         <ol>
          <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol13a1">
           The board does not have authority to reduce an assessment until the owner of the property has established to the satisfaction of the board that the owner of the property had first appealed the assessment to the local equalization board of the taxing district in which the property was assessed and to the county board of equalization of the county in which the property was assessed.

           The board does not have authority to reduce a new assessment provided for under section 57-14-08 until the owner of the property has established to the satisfaction of the board that the owner of the property had first appealed the assessment to the county board of equalization of the county in which the property was assessed.

        <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol13b">
         If it believes an assessment to be too low, the board may increase the assessment on any separate piece or parcel of real estate. The secretary of the board, by mail sent to the last-known address of the owner to whom the property was assessed, shall notify such person of the amount of increase made by the board in such assessment.

        <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol13c">
         The percentage of reduction or increase made by the board under this subsection in any assessment must be a whole-numbered amount and not a fractional amount.

       Equalize the classification and taxable status of real property in any assessment district in a county and in every county in the state in which the board determines the classification or taxable status is incorrect or inequitable. The board may equalize property under this subsection if information is received indicating that property within the assessment district or county may be erroneously classified or the property’s taxable status is incorrect. The board may also equalize property under this subsection if a property owner has properly appealed the property’s classification or taxable status. In the case of an appeal, the owner of the property must establish to the satisfaction of the board that the owner of the property had first appealed the classification or taxable status determination to the local equalization board of the taxing district in which the property is situated and to the county board of equalization of the county in which the property is situated.

       Provide for reviews of selected properties, parcels, or lots within each county by the tax commissioner, state supervisor of assessments, or their designee, to verify the accuracy of real property assessment listings, valuations, classifications, and eligibility for exemptions. The reviews must be examined by the state board of equalization at its annual meeting in August. The board may make necessary corrections in the property assessment listings, valuations, classifications, and eligibility for exemptions or direct the affected township, city, or county governing body to make the corrections ordered by the state board of equalization resulting from its examination of the reviews provided for in this section.
      </li>

       If any county or county official fails to take action ordered by the state board of equalization under the authority granted to it in this chapter or chapter 57-02, the board may petition any judge of the district court to issue a restraining order, writ of mandamus, or other form of declaratory or injunctive relief requiring the county or county official to comply with the order of the board. The order or notice upon the petition shall be returnable not more than ten days after the filing of the petition. The petition must be heard and determined on the return day, or on such day thereafter as the court shall fix, having regard to the speediest possible determination of the case consistent with the rights of the parties. The county or county official must show cause why the county or county official should not comply with any directive or order of the board. The judgment must include costs in favor of the prevailing party.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol18">
       The board may order a new assessment of any class of property, or of all the property, located within any political subdivision if, in its opinion, taxable property located within that subdivision has escaped assessment in whole or in part, has been assessed unfairly, or has not been assessed according to law. A new assessment ordered by the board must be made as provided in section 57-14-08.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-13s57-13-04ol19">
       A property owner may appeal the assessment, classification, and exempt status of the owner’s property to the state board of equalization if the property owner was foreclosed from attending assessment proceedings because of the failure to substantially comply with the notice requirements in chapters 57-02 or 57-12, or because of an irregularity in the township, city, or county assessment proceedings.

      Upon receipt of the report of the proceedings of the state board of equalization, the county auditor shall add to or deduct from each tract or lot of real property in the auditor’s county the required percentage of the valuation thereof, as it stands after the same has been equalized by the county board of equalization, adding in each case any fractional sum of fifty cents or more, and deducting in each case any fractional sum of less than fifty cents, so that the value of any separate tract or lot contains no fraction of a dollar. The county auditor shall revalue each tract or lot of real property that is reclassified by the state board of equalization using the proper valuation method for the class of taxable property as specified by the state board of equalization. The county auditor shall adjust the status of a tract or lot to comply with any determinations made by the state board of equalization in which the tract or lot is found by the state board of equalization to be taxable or exempt.

        District court erred in affirming a decision by a board of county commissioners denying the owners' application for an abatement of 2013 real estate taxes for three parcels of land because the county board incorrectly applied the omitted property provisions, which resulted in increasing the valuation for each parcel by the same amount where the county conceded it failed to timely notify the owners of a local board of equalization meeting before increasing the 2013 assessments, the State Board of Equalization established a valuation for the 2013 assessments at the 2012 true and full values, and the county auditor was not authorized to use the omitted property statutes to revalue or circumvent the State Board's 2013 valuations.

In the case of escaped real property, such taxes, if entered between the first day of July and the first day of November, must be entered upon the most recent delinquent real property tax list. If entered between November first and July first following, such taxes must be entered upon the current real property tax list. In either case, such real property taxes must be certified to the treasurer by the auditor and entered in the tax list by the treasurer. Taxes upon escaped property for prior years, whether upon real or personal property, are subject to the same penalties as other taxes, and such taxes must be enforced and apportioned as other taxes upon the lists upon which they are entered are enforced and apportioned.

    New assessment of property — Allowance.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For purposes of this section, a “new assessment” means an assessment ordered by a board of county commissioners, or as authorized under section 57-01-02 or 57-13-04, of any class of property, or of all property, located within any political subdivision of the county if taxable property located within a subdivision has escaped assessment in whole or in part, has been assessed unfairly, or has not been assessed according to law. A new assessment may be made as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-14s57-14-08ol11">
       Upon the filing of a petition signed by not less than ten freeholders in a political subdivision, or by the governing body of that subdivision, requesting a new assessment of property in the subdivision or upon investigation by the board of county commissioners, the board of county commissioners, before October first, may order a new assessment of any class of property, or of all property, located within the subdivision or within any subdivision. The state board of equalization or the tax commissioner may order a new assessment of any class of property or all property located in any political subdivision. The new assessment and equalization must be conducted under the terms and conditions as set forth in the state board of equalization or tax commissioner’s order. The local governing body responsible for performing the new assessment may petition the state board of equalization or tax commissioner for a modification of any or all of the order’s terms and conditions. The state board of equalization or tax commissioner may for good cause shown grant all or part of the modification request.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-14s57-14-08ol12">
       The board of county commissioners then may appoint a competent citizen of this state as a special assessor who shall make a new assessment of the property specified by the board and who shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of law governing assessors. The special assessor may be selected by competitive bidding or a process determined by the board of county commissioners. The special assessor is entitled to reasonable compensation by the board of county commissioners for the special assessor’s services, together with meals and lodging as allowed by law, and mileage expense at the rate allowed by law for each mile [1.61 kilometers] actually and necessarily traveled in the performance of that person’s duties, which must be audited and allowed by the board of county commissioners and paid out of the county treasury upon warrant of the county auditor. If the new assessment was ordered by the state board of equalization or tax commissioner, the state board of equalization or tax commissioner shall appoint a competent citizen of this state as a special assessor who shall make a new assessment of the property specified by the state board of equalization or tax commissioner to be completed under the terms and conditions set forth in the order; the special assessor shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of the law governing assessors; the special assessor is entitled to reasonable compensation by the state board of equalization or tax commissioner for that person’s services plus meals, lodging, and mileage expense at the rates provided by law, and the state board of equalization or tax commissioner shall audit and allow the bill, and the same must be paid out of the county treasury. In either case, the compensation must be charged to the political subdivision in which the new assessment was made and must be deducted by the county treasurer from funds coming into the treasurer’s hands apportionable to the subdivision. The board of county commissioners, state board of equalization, or tax commissioner who appoints a special assessor may authorize such assistants as may be necessary to aid the special assessor and shall allow reasonable compensation for each of the assistants plus meals, lodging, and mileage expense at the rates provided by law, which amounts must be audited, allowed, and paid and must be charged to the political subdivision in which the new assessment occurred in the manner provided for the special assessor.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-14s57-14-08ol13">
       Upon completion of the terms and conditions of the new assessment order, the assessor shall certify the result to the county auditor, who forthwith shall give notice by mail to the state tax commissioner and the board of county commissioners and the governing boards of each township, city, and school district which is wholly or partially within the newly assessed district, that a new assessment has been completed in the named assessment district as provided under this section and that a meeting for the purpose of equalizing the assessment will be held in the county courthouse on the day and at the time specified for the meeting of the county board of equalization. Each board shall appoint one of its members to attend the equalization meeting and the tax commissioner shall attend or appoint a representative from the commissioner’s office to attend the meeting. A notice that the new assessment provided for under this section will be considered during the meeting of the county board of equalization must be published at least once in the official newspaper of the county in which the new assessment was made not less than one week prior to the meeting. The claims for mileage expense and necessary expenses for meals and lodging of the tax commissioner or the commissioner’s appointee in attending the special equalization meeting must be audited, allowed, and paid as are other similar claims made by them.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-14s57-14-08ol14">
       When any special assessor has increased the true and full valuation of any lot or tract of land including any improvements to that lot or tract of land by three thousand dollars or more and by ten percent or more of the last assessment as a result of the new assessment provided for under this section, written notice of the amount of increase over the last assessment and the amount of the last assessment must be delivered in writing by the special assessor to the property owner, mailed in writing to the property owner at the property owner’s last-known address, or provided to the property owner by electronic mail directed with verification of receipt to an electronic mail address at which the property owner has consented to receive notice. The tax commissioner shall prescribe suitable forms for this notice and the notice must also show the true and full value as defined by law of the property, including improvements, that the special assessor used in making the new assessment and must also show the date prescribed by law for the meeting of the county board of equalization of the county in which the property is located. Delivery of notice to the property owner under this section must be completed at least fifteen days in advance of the meeting date of the county board of equalization and at the expense of the assessment district for which the special assessor is employed.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-14s57-14-08ol15">
       At the meeting, the county board of equalization shall hear all grievances and complaints in regard to the new assessment provided for under this section and shall proceed to equalize the same. All tax lists must be corrected to comply with the action.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-14s57-14-08ol16">
       Any property owner aggrieved by a decision of the county board of equalization with regard to the new assessment provided for under this section may appeal that decision to the state board of equalization at its August meeting. The board does not have authority to reduce a new assessment until the owner of property has established to the satisfaction of the board that the owner of the property had first appealed the new assessment to the county board of equalization of the county in which the property was assessed.

      The tax rate of all taxes, except taxes the rate of which is fixed by law, must be calculated and fixed by the county auditor within the limitations prescribed by statute. If any municipality levies a greater amount than the prescribed maximum legal rate of levy will produce, the county auditor shall extend only such amount of tax as the prescribed maximum legal rate of levy will produce. The rate must be based and computed on the taxable valuation of taxable property in the municipality or district levying the tax. The rate of all taxes must be calculated by the county auditor in mills, tenths, and hundredths of mills.

    General fund levy limitations in cities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The aggregate amount levied for city general fund purposes may not exceed an amount produced by a levy of one hundred five mills on the taxable valuation of property in the city. A city, when authorized by a majority vote of the electors of the city voting on the question at a regularly scheduled or special election called for such purpose pursuant to a resolution approved by the governing body of the city, may increase the maximum mill levy for general city purposes by not more than ten mills.
     </p>
     <p>
      A city that levied more than one hundred five mills for taxable year 2015 in the combined number of mills levied for general fund purposes plus the number of mills levied for other purposes which were combined into the general fund for taxable years after 2014 may levy for general fund purposes for taxable year 2016 the same number of mills that was levied for those purposes for taxable year 2015. A city may levy for general fund purposes for taxable year 2017 one hundred five mills plus seventy-five percent of the combined number of mills exceeding one hundred five that was levied for those purposes for taxable year 2015. A city may levy for general fund purposes for taxable year 2018 one hundred five mills plus fifty percent of the combined number of mills exceeding one hundred five that was levied for those purposes for taxable year 2015. A city may levy for general fund purposes for taxable year 2019 one hundred five mills plus twenty-five percent of the combined number of mills exceeding one hundred five that was levied for those purposes for taxable year 2015.

The tax is to be levied, spread, and collected in the same manner as are other taxes in the park district. The question of whether the levy is to be discontinued must be submitted to the qualified electors at the next regular election upon petition of twenty-five percent or more of the qualified electors voting in the last regular park district election, if the petition is filed not less than sixty days before the election. If the majority of the qualified electors voting on the question vote to discontinue the levy, it may not again be levied without a majority vote of the qualified electors voting on the question at a later regular election on the question of relevying the tax, which question may be submitted upon petition as above provided or by decision of the governing board.

      School district taxes must be levied by the governing body of each school district on or before the tenth day of August of each year. The governing body of the school district may increase or decrease its tax levy and budget for the current fiscal year on or before the tenth day of October of each year but the certification must be filed with the county auditor within the time limitations under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-15s57-15-31" target="_self">57-15-31.</a></cite>1. Taxes for school district purposes must be based upon an itemized budget statement which must show the complete expenditure program of the district for the current fiscal year and the sources of the revenue from which it is to be financed. The school board of each public school district, in levying taxes, is limited by the amount necessary to be raised for the purpose of meeting the appropriations included in the school budget of the current fiscal year, and the sum necessary to be provided as an interim fund, together with a tax sufficient in amount to pay the interest on the bonded debt of the district and to provide a sinking fund to pay and discharge the principal thereof at maturity.

       The governing body of any school district shall levy taxes annually for a school building fund, not in excess of twenty mills, which levy is in addition to and not restricted by the levy limitations prescribed by law, when authorized to do so by sixty percent of the qualified electors voting upon the question at a regular or special election in any school district. The governing body of the school district may create the building fund by appropriating and setting up in its budget for an amount not in excess of twenty percent of the current annual appropriation for all other purposes combined, exclusive of appropriations to pay interest and principal of the bonded debt, and not in excess of the limitations prescribed by law. If a portion or all of the proceeds of the levy have been allocated by contract to the payment of rentals upon contracts with the state board of public school education as administrator of the state school construction fund, the levy must be made annually by the governing body of the school district until the full amount of all such obligations is fully paid. Any portion of a levy for a school building fund which has not been allocated by contract with the state board of public school education must be allocated by the governing body pursuant to section 57-15-17. Upon the completion of all payments to the state school construction fund, or upon payment and cancellation or defeasance of the bonds, the levy may be discontinued at the discretion of the governing body of the school district, or upon petition of twenty percent of the qualified electors who voted in the last school election, the question of discontinuance of the levy must be submitted to the qualified electors of the school district at any regular or special election and, upon a favorable vote of sixty percent of the qualified electors voting, the levy must be discontinued. Any school district, executing a contract or lease with the state board of public school education or issuing general obligation bonds, which contract or lease or bond issue requires the maintenance of the levy provided in this section, shall immediately file a certified copy of the contract, lease, or bond issue with the county auditor or auditors of the county or counties in which the school district is located. The county auditor or auditors shall register the contract, lease, or bond issue in the bond register in substantially the manner provided in section 21-03-23. Upon the filing of the contract, lease, or bond issue with the county auditor or auditors, the school district may not discontinue the levy and the levy must automatically be included in the tax levy of the school district from year to year by the county auditor or auditors until a sufficient sum of money has been collected to pay to the state treasurer for the retirement of all obligations of the school district with the state board of public school education or to pay to the custodian of the bond sinking fund all amounts due or to become due on the bonds.

The plan shall designate the general area intended to be served by use of such fund. The area intended to be served shall be described in the plan but need not be described in the building fund ballot. After approval of the levy and the plan no change shall be made in the purpose of expenditure of the building fund except that upon a favorable vote of sixty percent of the qualified electors residing in any specific area intended to be served, material changes may be made in such plan as it affects such area to the extent such changes do not conflict with contractual obligations incurred. The provisions of this section and of subsection 1 of section 57-15-17 in regard to the purpose for which the building fund may be expended shall not apply to expenditures for major repairs.

        This section permits a school board to levy extra taxes for a school building fund if authorized to do so by sixty percent of the qualified electors in a school district election. It does not require the school board to levy taxes for such a fund. Rather than limiting the authority of the school board, it expands the board’s taxing authority. This section does not preclude the use of general fund money for building purposes. Peterson v. McKenzie County Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 467 N.W.2d 456, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

    Emergency fund — County.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of any county may levy a tax for emergency purposes not exceeding the limitation in subsection 9 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-15s57-15-06" target="_self">57-15-06.</a></cite>7. The emergency fund may not be considered in determining the budget or the amount to be levied for each fiscal year for normal tax purposes but must be shown in the budget as an “emergency fund” and may not be deducted from the budget as otherwise provided by law. Each county may create an emergency fund, and all taxes levied for emergency purposes by any county, when collected, must be deposited in the emergency fund, and must be used only for emergency purposes caused by the destruction or impairment of any county property necessary for the conduct of the affairs of the county or emergencies caused by nature. The emergency fund may not be used for the purchase of road equipment. The emergency fund may not be used for any road construction or maintenance, except for repair of roads damaged by nature within sixty days preceding the determination to expend emergency funds; however, the emergency fund may be used to match federal funds appropriated to mitigate damage to roads related to a federally declared disaster that occurred more than sixty days preceding the determination. Any unexpended balance remaining in the emergency fund at the end of any fiscal year must be kept in the fund. When the amount of money in the emergency fund, plus the amount of money due the fund from outstanding taxes, equals the amount produced by a levy of five mills on the taxable valuation of property in a county with a population of thirty thousand or more, ten mills on the taxable valuation of property in a county with a population of less than thirty thousand but more than five thousand, or fifteen mills on the taxable valuation of property in a county with a population of five thousand or fewer, the levy authorized by this section must be discontinued, and no further levy may be made until required to replenish the emergency fund.

      Whenever any city or township having an existing liability or indebtedness is authorized to levy taxes for the payment of the same and fails or refuses to elect proper officers for the government of the municipality, the board of county commissioners of the county in which the municipality is located, upon a proper showing by any person having a legal or subsisting claim against the municipality that there are no legal officers in the municipality authorized to levy a tax for the payment of such indebtedness, shall levy a tax as the governing body would be authorized to levy the same for the payment of such indebtedness. Any person having a claim against such municipality has the same right to enforce the levy of such tax by the board of county commissioners that the person would have had to compel such levy by the officers of the municipality had they been properly elected and qualified.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon petition of ten percent of the number of qualified electors of the county voting in the last election for governor or upon its own motion, the board of county commissioners of each county shall levy annually a tax not exceeding the limitation in subsection 10 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-15s57-15-06" target="_self">57-15-06.</a></cite>7, for the purpose of subsidizing county emergency medical services; provided, that this tax must be approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the county voting on the question at a regular or special countywide election. The county may budget, in addition to its annual operating budget for subsidizing emergency medical service, no more than ten percent of its annual operating budget as a depreciation expense to be set aside in a dedicated emergency medical services sinking fund deposited with the treasurer for the replacement of equipment and ambulances. The ten percent emergency medical services sinking fund must be in addition to the annual operating budget for subsidization, but the total of the annual operating budget and the annual ten percent emergency medical services sinking fund may not exceed the approved mill levy. If the county contains a rural ambulance service district or rural fire protection district that levies for and provides emergency medical service, the property within that district is exempt from the county tax levy under this section upon notice from the governing body of the district to the board of county commissioners of the existence of the district.

       Examination of the legislative history of the temporary amendments to former N.D.C.C. § 57-19-06 showed that a withdrawal without repayment of fifty percent of the funds in a school district’s special reserve fund pursuant to subsection 2 added by the temporary amendments was not subject to the limiting condition in subsection 1 of former N.D.C.C. § 57-19-06 that tax collections must be insufficient to meet the requirements of the budget for teacher salaries, heat, light, and fuel. Therefore, the District was authorized to withdraw funds from its special reserve fund for its general fund without repayment and without preconditions. Reed v. Hillsboro Pub. Sch. Dist.

      The tax list must be made out to correspond with the assessment books with respect to ownership and description of property, with columns for the valuation and for the various items of tax included in the total amount of all taxes set down opposite such description of property. The amounts of special taxes must be entered in appropriate columns, but the general taxes may be shown by entering the rate of each tax at the head of the proper column without extending the same, in which case a schedule of the rates of such taxes must be made on the first page of each tax list. The tax lists also must show, in a separate column, the years for which a tax lien has been foreclosed upon any piece or parcel, if the same has not been redeemed or deeded for such taxes.

       On or before December twenty-sixth of each year, the county treasurer shall mail a real estate tax statement to the owner of each parcel of real property at the owner’s last-known address. The form of the real estate tax statement to be used in every county must be prescribed and approved for use by the tax commissioner. The statement must be provided in a manner that allows the taxpayer to retain a printed record of the obligation for payment of taxes and special assessments as provided in the statement. If a parcel of real property is owned by more than one individual, the county treasurer shall send only one statement to one of the owners of that property. Additional copies of the tax statement will be sent to the other owners upon their request and the furnishing of their names and addresses to the county treasurer. The tax statement must:

        North Dakota’s practice of arbitrarily classifying real property owned by railroads as personal property is discriminatory and the effect of such a practice is to deny the railroads the five percent discount for early payment of real estate taxes; the classification of real property as personal property is in violation of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976.

       Failure to comply with provisions of former N.D.C.C. § 57-24-07 by posting the list of lands subject to the tax sale in two public places, rather than the statutorily specified four public places, was not a jurisdictional defect.

      After hearing, the court may issue an order directing the tenant to pay to the county treasurer all rents payable under the terms of the lease of the property, either due or to become due, and also directing the county treasurer to apply the said payments of rent to the delinquent and current taxes and special assessments, including penalty and interest, and the costs and expenses of the proceeding as determined and taxed by the court. In such order, or thereafter, upon application and hearing, the court, in its discretion, may allow to the taxpayer a percentage of rents, property, and crops, as to the court may seem just, up to and including fifty percent thereof, and may order the treasurer to pay such percentage to such taxpayer at such times and under such circumstances as to the court may seem just and equitable.

      <p>
       A sheriff must confine his attempts to execute his warrant to seizure of goods and chattels found within territorial limits of his county. Schaffner v. Young, 10 N.D. 245, 86 N.W. 733, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 1901).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where statute requires county treasurer to deliver a list of delinquent taxes to sheriff and requires sheriff to proceed with collection, and where neither treasurer nor sheriff has authority to cancel illegal taxes, an owner may assume that officers will obey statute and can pay taxes under protest without waiting for a seizure to make payment involuntarily.

      </p>
      <p>
       The duty of sheriff to collect delinquent taxes is peremptory and immediate. He has no authority to cancel or rebate illegal taxes. Ford Motor Co. v. State, 65 N.D. 316, 258 N.W. 596, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 1935).

If the taxes for which said property is distrained, with penalties and cost, are not paid before the day appointed for such sale, which may not be less than ten days after the taking of such property, the sheriff or the sheriff’s deputy shall proceed, at public auction, to sell the property, or so much thereof as is sufficient to pay the taxes and the penalties and costs of distress and sale, and any surplus arising from the sale must be disposed of as in the case of the sale of mortgaged personal property.

     <p>
      If a township, city, or county officer learns or believes that there is danger that personal property which has been assessed and upon which any personal property taxes are due or will be due, will be sold, or removed from the county, without payment of the taxes and without leaving sufficient property to pay the whole of such taxes, the officer shall report such fact to the sheriff, who forthwith shall collect the taxes, or distrain and sell sufficient property to pay the same, if they are not paid on demand, or require an undertaking from the owner in favor of the county treasurer, conditioned that all taxes levied upon such property will be paid when due. Such undertaking must be approved by the recorder, unless the board of county commissioners designates a different official. If the taxes involved have not been levied, they must be ascertained by the county auditor by applying the aggregate mill levy of the previous year for the taxing district in which the property is assessed to the current taxable valuation, and if, after the tax for the current year is levied, there is any excess, it must be refunded to the taxpayer on order of the board of county commissioners. In case a bond has been given, and the taxes are not paid when due, the county treasurer shall bring an action for the taxes and costs in the district court of the county, and the state’s attorney shall represent the treasurer in such action on the bond.

      The state, and each county thereof, to the extent of the amount of taxes assessed and levied against particular personal property and property included in the same class, as disclosed by the statutory assessment list, has a lien upon such property prior to all other liens on or against the same. Any person holding a lien on personal property of any tax debtor may demand and require the property of the tax debtor not covered by a lien to be first exhausted in the payment of such taxes.

      Personal property taxes must be made a lien upon real estate of the tax debtor as follows:

     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-22s57-22-21ol11">
       At its January meeting in each year, the board of county commissioners shall declare by resolution that all unpaid and uncanceled personal property taxes, from and after the date of the extension and entry thereof as provided in this chapter, constitute a lien on any real estate owned by the tax debtor, or which the tax debtor thereafter may acquire, and shall make such taxes a specific lien on particular descriptions of real property owned by the tax debtor as of the date of the extension and entry of such lien.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-22s57-22-21ol12">
       The county auditor shall extend to and enter upon the tax list of real estate then in the hands of the county treasurer, for the year immediately preceding, opposite the descriptions of real estate designated by the board of county commissioners which belong to the personal property tax debtor, the year for which the personal property taxes are uncollected and the amount thereof. Such entry must be made without regard to any prior payment of real estate taxes on said descriptions, and the treasurer is without authority thereafter to issue any receipt in full for said real estate taxes without making collection at the same time of the personal property taxes so extended; a taxpayer holding a specific superior lien on said descriptions ahead of personal property taxes charged thereon is entitled to tax receipts without regard to nonpayment of such inferior personal taxes.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-22s57-22-21ol13">
       If the tax debtor afterwards acquires any real property in the county, such delinquent personal property taxes may be entered in like manner upon any subsequent tax list, and from the time of such entry is a lien on any real property of the tax debtor against which they were entered in the same manner and to the same extent as the taxes upon such real property.

      The sheriff or the sheriff’s deputy must be allowed the same fees for making distraint and sale of goods and chattels for the payment of taxes as are allowed by law for making a levy and sale of personal property on execution, and travel fees must be allowed as determined by law. Such fees and mileage must be added to any tax and collected by the sheriff, and when presenting a statement and bill for such fees and mileage a full and complete description of the route traveled must be given. In no case may mileage be charged more than once from the county seat of the county in which the services required are performed.

       In any county where for any reason personal property taxes that have been delinquent more than one year remain unpaid and uncanceled, whether put into judgment or not, the board of county commissioners may contract with the sheriff of the county, or with any elector of the state, to pay a percentage of the delinquent personal property taxes, not exceeding ten percent of the amount collected, as compensation for collecting the same, in lieu of, or in addition to, the compensation provided by law for said sheriff. When a contract is made with any person other than the sheriff, the county commissioners may in their discretion pay any reasonable salary or expenses or a percentage of the tax collected, or combination thereof, and the contract may cover all or only certain taxing districts within the county, and contracts may be made with different collectors for different portions of the county. In the event delinquent personal property taxes are owed by a person not residing in North Dakota, the county commissioners may contract with any person, firm, corporation, or limited liability company, to pay a reasonable percentage of the delinquent taxes collected, as compensation for the collection. Such contractors shall execute either a personal or corporate surety bond conditioned upon satisfactory performance of the provisions of the contract and shall be in an amount and of a type approved by the county commissioners.

        Essentially, economic obsolescence is a form of depreciation which may be applicable when physical depreciation fails to adequately recognize the decline in value. Like physical depreciation, economic obsolescence provides a method for determining the remaining value of the useful life of an asset. Midwest Processing Co. v. McHenry County, 467 N.W.2d 895, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Although issues of economic obsolescence involve elements of appraisal judgment which may result in differing results by reasonable appraisers, using economic obsolescence as part of cost approach valuation was not arbitrary and capricious, even though the property appraisal was 250% of the purchase price.

        Board of county commissioner’s acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in adopting assessments for commercial properties where the assessor conceded the properties could not have sold in 2016 for the value they were assessed, market value was synonymous with true and full value, and thus, the assessments were in excess of their true and full value.

        A reviewing court may not reverse a local governing body’s action simply because it finds some of the material considered more convincing; only when there is such an absence of evidence or reason as to amount to arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable action, can a reviewing court reverse, and both the district court and the supreme court are limited to this scope of review.

       <p>
        Board of County Commissioner’s decision to assess an office building at $4.2 million was neither invalid, inequitable or unjust and was not reversed as being arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious where the valuation was the result of a consensus reached by a well-informed group of commissioners and the assessment was well within the boundaries of the values set by the county assessor and the appraisers. Dakota Northwestern Assocs. Ltd. P'ship. v. Burleigh County Bd. of County Comm'rs, 2000 ND 164, 616 N.W.2d 349, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 2000).

        District court did not err in dismissing taxpayer’s claims against a county and county officials because the taxpayers did not first submit their property tax claims to the county board of commissioners; if the taxpayers believed the county erred by not accepting and honoring their promissory notes as payment for property taxes, their remedy was to seek redress with the board of commissioners.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An application for an abatement or refund must be in writing and must be filed in duplicate with the county auditor. It must state the grounds relied upon for such abatement or refund and give the post-office address of the applicant. The county auditor shall note the date of filing, shall file the same, and, within five business days of the filing date, shall present a copy to the city auditor or the township clerk if the applicant’s assessed property is within a city or an organized township. The county auditor shall present the application to the board of county commissioners at its next regular meeting. The county auditor shall give the applicant notice by mail of the time and place of hearing on any abatement or refund not less than ten days prior to such hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person having any estate, right, title, or interest in or lien upon any real property who claims that the assessment made or the tax levied against the same is excessive or illegal, in whole or in part, is entitled to make an application for abatement, refund, or compromise, as the case may be, and have such application granted if the facts upon which the application is based bring it within the provisions of this chapter for abatement, refund, or compromise. In addition, if an abatement is based upon any of the grounds specified in section 57-23-04 and if the application for abatement will not result in a refund of tax or a compromise of a tax, the abatement application may be signed and submitted by either the county auditor or the assessor who made the assessment resulting in the tax specified in the abatement application.

     <p>
      If tax on any real estate remains unpaid after the second Tuesday in December in the year it is due, the board of county commissioners, subject to the approval of the state tax commissioner, by reason of depreciation in the value of the property or for other valid cause, may compromise with the owner of the property by abating a portion of the delinquent taxes, with any penalty and interest on that portion, on payment of the remainder. The county commissioners may not compromise the tax after the county auditor has issued a tax deed to the county.

     <p>
      In case a mortgage, lien, or sheriff’s certificate, or any other instrument conveying an interest in property, affects only a part of the real estate taxed as a unit, any person interested therein may petition the county auditor that the person be permitted to pay taxes and satisfy any outstanding tax lien as to that part only of the real estate in which the party is interested. Such petition must set forth the petitioner’s interest in the property. It must be verified and may be in the form of an affidavit. Immediately upon the receipt of such petition, the county auditor shall consider the same and shall make a fair and equitable valuation of the whole tract. The county auditor shall apportion to the petitioner a part of the taxes, interest, and penalty to be paid by the petitioner in order to effect satisfaction, which must bear to the taxes, special assessments, interest, penalty, and costs accrued on the whole tract the ratio which the value of the part or parcel of land in which the petitioner claims an interest bears to the value of the entire assessed tract of land. Thereupon the county auditor, by certified mail, shall notify all persons interested in such real property according to the record, either as owner or as the holder of a mortgage or other lien or sheriff’s certificate, of the filing of such petition and of the auditor’s assessment of such tract or parcel of land and of the auditor’s apportionment of the taxes thereon, and the date when the same will be considered and heard by the auditor. Such hearing may not be less than ten days after the mailing of such notice. Upon the date set, the county auditor shall hear the parties interested and shall assess such tract and apportion the taxes thereon as the auditor deems fair and equitable.

        Failure of county auditor to serve notice of expiration of redemption period upon any party entitled to be served is fatal to validity of tax deed issued to county pursuant to such notice. Schott v. Enander, 73 N.D. 352, 15 N.W.2d 303, 1944 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1944); Tarnovsky v. Security State Bank, 77 N.W.2d 828, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where county seeks to acquire title to land sold to county at a tax sale, statutory notice of expiration of redemption period is jurisdictional and right of redemption remains in effect if notice is not served.

        Since the effective set of deeds in the chain of title leading up to plat recognized the undivided interest in one of three trustees as the only trustee holding legal title to the property, and since only that trustee joined in the plat for the lots later sold for nonpayment of taxes, trial court correctly found that only notifying that named, sole trustee holding legal title as co-owner among six “apparent record title owners” was sufficient.

      After the date of foreclosure for property with an unsatisfied tax lien, the county auditor shall issue a tax deed to the county or, in cases in which the department of water resources has made an assessment against the property under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.61.html#t61c61-03s61-03-21" target="_blank">61-03-21.</a></cite>3, the county auditor shall issue a tax deed to the state or, if the property was sold by another political subdivision of this state within the ten years preceding the foreclosure, the county auditor shall issue a tax deed to that political subdivision. The tax deed passes the property in fee to the county, the state, or political subdivision, free from all encumbrances except installments of special assessments certified to the county auditor or which may become due after the service of the notice of foreclosure of tax lien, a homestead credit for special assessments lien provided for in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-02s57-02-08" target="_self">57-02-08.</a></cite>3, and an easement or right of way recorded with an effective date that precedes the date of official notice to the record titleholder which states that property taxes are delinquent and constitute a property lien. While the county, the state, or political subdivision holds title under a tax deed, it is not liable for the payment of any installments of special assessments which become due unless the board of county commissioners, the state, or political subdivision has leased or contracted to sell the property. A deed issued under this section is prima facie evidence of the truth and regularity of all facts and proceedings before the execution of the deed.

    Appraisal for annual sale — Minimum sale price.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All property acquired by the county by tax deed must be appraised by the board of county commissioners at least thirty days before the annual sale under this chapter. The appraised price must be sufficient to cover all taxes, special assessments, homestead credit for special assessments, penalties, interest, and costs which were due against the property at the time of the service of the notice of foreclosure of tax lien, plus an amount equal to the estimated taxes and special assessments for the current assessment year. If the fair market value of the property is more than the total amount due against the property, the minimum sale price of the property must be at least equal to the total amount due against the property. If the fair market value of the property is less than the total amount due against the property, the board shall fix a fair minimum sale price for the property.

        Where court commissioners appraised the land more than thirty days before the annual sale and determined the minimum sale price before rather than after county auditor issued tax deed, there is substantial compliance with this section and a valid appraisal.

      After an appraisal or reappraisal of property acquired by tax deed, the board of county commissioners shall set a date for hearing objections to the minimum sale price determined. At least ten days before the hearing, the county auditor shall mail to the auditor of any city, or the clerk of the board of supervisors of any township, in which appraised property is located a written notice stating the time when objections to the established minimum sale price will be heard. Any member or representative of the governing body of any taxing district may appear at the hearing with reference to the fair market value of appraised property, and the board may make appropriate changes in the minimum sale price of property.

       If the county continues to retain the property acquired by tax deed after the initial appraisal is conducted and the annual sale is held, the board may reappraise the value of the property at any time deemed necessary by the board. The reappraisal of the property must be completed at least thirty days before a subsequent annual sale under this chapter. Any property not sold at the annual November sale may be sold by the county auditor at private sale before the next annual November sale for not less than the property’s minimum sale price. A parcel of real estate against which an unpaid special assessment continues as a lien under section 57-28-09 may be sold by the county auditor free of the lien if the governing body of the city in which the property is located finds that the sum of the minimum sale price and the unpaid special assessment exceeds the market value of the property. If the governing body of the city makes this finding, it may cancel all or part of the special assessment lien against the property to reduce the lien to an amount which, when added to the minimum sale price, will be equal to the market value of the property. The action of the governing body shall be certified by the city auditor or clerk to the county auditor. The county auditor may then sell the property at private sale before the next annual November sale for not less than the resulting amount. The purchaser acquires the property free from any part of any lien for special assessment which was canceled by the governing body of the city, and the county auditor shall remove from the record any canceled special assessments.

        A sale of tax-acquired property at private sale by a county, without giving the former owner notice of his right to repurchase and of the county’s intention to sell, is not void but merely voidable at the instance of a person having the right of repurchase.

    Rights of repurchase.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The former owner; the former owner’s executor or administrator; or any parent, spouse, or child of the former owner may repurchase any property forfeited to the county under tax deed proceedings, so long as the tax title to the property remains in the county. If any city has made a special assessment for public improvements against the property and the special assessment has become delinquent and remains unpaid, the city has a right to purchase the property for cash, at the appraised value, prior to that of any party. Upon appraisal of the property, the county auditor shall give notice to the auditor of any such city and the city has thirty days within which to exercise its priority right to purchase the property under this section. A repurchase by a private party under this section may be for cash or contract for deed made by and between the board of county commissioners and the former owner; the executor or administrator of the former owner; or any parent, spouse, or child of the former owner. The consideration of the repurchase contract with a private party must include:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-19ol11">
       The total amount required to be paid to effect a satisfaction of tax lien.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-19ol12">
       The total amount of all subsequent taxes and special assessments with interest, penalties, and costs.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If the fair market value of the property at the time of the repurchase is less than the amount to be paid under subsections 1 and 2, the board shall fix a fair sale price for the property. If a repurchase under this section is by contract for deed, the party making the repurchase must pay at least twenty-five percent of the total contract price in cash and the remainder must be payable in no more than ten annual equal installments. The board of county commissioners shall establish the rate of interest for a contract for deed under this section, not exceeding the prime rate of interest established by the Bank of North Dakota for the month immediately preceding the month in which the contract was entered. A contract for deed under this section must provide that if the repurchaser or the successor in interest fails to pay one or more of the installments when due, with interest, the board of county commissioners may cancel the contract and all payments and improvements made by the repurchaser or the successor in interest will be forfeited to the county as liquidated damages for breach of contract unless otherwise expressly provided. Upon the completion of a cash sale or payments under a contract for deed under this section, the county auditor shall execute and deliver a deed conveying to the repurchaser the entire interest of the county in the property. Upon the execution and delivery of a deed or contract for deed under this section, the property becomes taxable to the repurchaser. In case of repurchase or contract for repurchase of tax deed property during January, the property must be assessed and taxed for that year, and the repurchaser is entitled to the rental and landlord’s share of crops on the property for the year. In case of the repurchase or contract for repurchase of tax deed land after January, the property must not be assessed and taxed for the current year, and the county is entitled to the rental and landlord’s share of crops on the property for the year. The repurchase or contract for repurchase of tax deed farmland is subject to any existing farm lease of the property for the year in which the repurchase or contract for repurchase is made.

        This statute gives to former owner the right to repurchase real estate so long as tax title thereto remains in the county, despite an attempted resale to another. Coverston v. Grand Forks County, 74 N.D. 552, 23 N.W.2d 746, 1946 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D. 1946).

        United States’
   request for title determination of property subject to tax foreclosure proceedings was granted but claimants’ motion for title hearing was denied because the foreclosure proceedings against claimants were properly initiated and processed, so the property was properly transferred in fee, free from all encumbrances except special assessments, by a tax deed to the county pursuant to N.D.C.C. §§ 57-28-08, 57-28-09, and thus, the claimants’
   right, title, and interest to the property extinguished when the property was transferred by tax deed to the county, and the claimants’ right to redeem the property extinguished upon transfer from the county to a third-party under N.D.C.C. § 57-28-19 .

     <p>
      A city that has purchased property or a county that has acquired a tax deed to property under this chapter is deemed to have marketable record title to the property if all of the following apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-19.3ol11">
       The county deed conveying the property has been recorded.

      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-19.3ol12">
       The city or county has entered into possession of the property and continued its possession for three months or longer.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-19.3ol13">
       No lis pendens giving notice of the pendency of an action challenging the validity of tax proceedings or of the deed has been recorded within three months of the date on which the city or county entered into possession of the property.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A city or county that is deemed to have marketable record title may convey title free of any claims based on a defect in the process through which the city or county obtained title to the property. If title of the city or county is deemed marketable under this section, a claimant who would be entitled to some claim on the property because of a defect in the process by which the city or county obtained title has instead the right to recover from the city or county the net value of that claim, subject to the statutory restrictions on claims against a city or county. For the purpose of this section, the fact of possession by the city or county may be shown of record by one or more affidavits that contain the legal description of the property and show that the city or county entered into possession of the property and continued possession for three months or longer. The posting on the property of a sign or notice, legible from the street adjacent to the property, stating that the property is owned or for sale by the city or county is an act of possession by the city or county, but is not required.

      All proceeds from the public or private sale of property under this chapter must be apportioned as regular tax payments are apportioned among and within taxing districts in which the property is located, as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-20ol11">
       The county treasurer shall issue a regular tax receipt in the name of the county, beginning with the earliest year for which the taxes are delinquent. Tax receipts must be written for the amount of the tax, with penalty and interest. If the property was sold for an amount sufficient to cover all outstanding taxes, special assessments, penalties, interest, and costs associated with selling the property, tax receipts must be written for all such years, and any remaining amount must be retained by the county for ninety days following the date of the sale. After the ninety-day retention period, any excess proceeds must be distributed:

        <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-20ol11b">
         To the clerk of the district court in the county in which all or a majority of the property is located if a disputed claim or multiple claims for the excess proceeds were submitted within the ninety-day retention period; or

      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-20ol12">
       If the property is sold under a contract, the county treasurer shall issue tax receipts, beginning with the earliest year for which taxes or special assessments are delinquent, with penalty and interest, and all subsequent payments made on the contract must be applied to the earliest remaining unpaid taxes or special assessments. Any payment under the contract after all taxes, special assessments, penalties, interest, and costs associated with selling the property are paid must be retained by the county for ninety days following the date of the sale.

    Discretion of county commissioners in lease or sale of tax deed lands.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of county commissioners may refuse to sell or lease any agricultural lands held by the county under a tax deed if the board finds that any of the following would result:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-27ol11">
       The use would seriously impair the fertility of the property or adjoining property due to wind or water erosion.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-27ol12">
       The property will become a part of an agricultural unit that will be too small or too large to be operated in the best interests of the community and taxing districts and the use may result in failure of the owner or lessee to pay taxes upon the property.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-28s57-28-27ol13">
       The use would result in lessening the value or marketability of adjacent property held by the county.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The board of county commissioners may classify agricultural lands held by the county according to suitability for tillage, haying, or grazing purposes. Applicants for deeds or leases may file with the county auditor a statement of the size of the farming unit for which the property is desired, the uses intended for the property, and any other information relative to the planned operation of the property which is required by the board of county commissioners.

      The tax commissioner, after the provisions of chapter 57-06 have been complied with and final assessment has been made by the state board of equalization, shall compute a tax upon the valuation fixed as is provided by law for the assessment of other utilities. Such a tax must be computed by applying to that portion of the valuation which by law is subject to tax the average millage rate, which is obtained by dividing the total taxable valuation of all property within this state for the current year, into the total of all state and local taxes assessed within the state on a millage basis for the current year. The tax for air transportation companies must be computed by applying, to that portion of the valuation which by law is subject to the tax, the average millage rate which is obtained by dividing the total taxable valuation of all property for the current year, within all cities operating an airport served by scheduled airlines in North Dakota, into the total of all state and local taxes assessed within all such cities on a millage basis for the current year.

      On or before the thirty-first day of March in each year, the tax commissioner shall provide each company assessed under the provisions of this chapter a statement of its taxes due for the preceding year, with the valuations and taxes assessed in each case. Such taxes are due upon the fifteenth day of April next following the date of the statement of taxes due. The taxes become delinquent on the first day of May next following the due date and, if not paid on or before said date, are subject to a penalty of two percent and, on June first following delinquency, an additional penalty of two percent and, on July first following delinquency, an additional penalty of two percent and, an additional penalty of two percent on October fifteenth following delinquency. From and after January first of the year following the year in which the taxes became due and payable, simple interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum upon the principal of the unpaid taxes must be charged until such taxes and penalties are paid, with such interest charges to be prorated to the nearest full month for a fractional year of delinquency. All the provisions of the law respecting delinquency of personal property assessments generally so far as may be consistent with the provisions of this chapter are applicable equally to the assessments and taxes provided for in this chapter.

      The taxes imposed by this chapter upon air transportation companies must be collected by the state tax commissioner and deposited with the state treasurer, who shall credit the same to the air transportation fund, but within ninety days after receipt thereof, these funds must be allocated and remitted as herein provided by the state treasurer to the cities or municipal airport authorities where such transportation companies make regularly scheduled landings. The taxes collected from each company must be allocated to each city or municipal airport authority where that company makes regularly scheduled landings by multiplying the total tax collected by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the company’s property at a given city or municipal airport and the denominator of which is the total value of the property located in North Dakota that is subject to the assessment. It is the duty of the tax commissioner to certify to the state treasurer the names of such air transportation companies and the amount of tax of each company that must be allocated by the state treasurer to each city or municipal airport authority.

      If a corporation or limited liability company taxable under this chapter fails for any reason to file the required returns or pay the tax due, any of its officers, governors, or managers having control or supervision of, or charged with the responsibility for making, the returns and payments, are personally liable for the failure.

The sum due for such a liability may be assessed and collected under this chapter for the assessment and collection of other liabilities. If the officers, governors, or managers elect not to be personally liable for the failure to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation or limited liability company must make a cash deposit or post with the commissioner a bond or undertaking executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this state. The cash deposit, bond, or undertaking must be in an amount equal to the estimated annual tax liability of the corporation or limited liability company.

Gross receipts tax revenues under this chapter exceeding eight million four hundred thousand dollars must be deposited in the state general fund.

The balance in the telecommunications carriers tax fund, not exceeding eight million four hundred thousand dollars, is appropriated as a standing and continuing appropriation to the tax commissioner for annual allocation to counties under this section. If gross receipts tax revenues available for allocation on the first day of March of any year are less than eight million four hundred thousand dollars, there is appropriated as a standing and continuing appropriation from the state general fund the amount that, when added to gross receipts tax revenues available for allocation from the telecommunications carriers tax fund results in allocation of eight million four hundred thousand dollars to counties per calendar year. On or before the first day of March of each year, the tax commissioner shall certify for payment to the state treasurer an amount determined to be due each county.

       If a telecommunications carrier refuses or neglects to make the reports required by this chapter, or refuses or neglects to furnish any information requested, the tax commissioner shall use the best available facts and estimates to determine taxation of the gross receipts of that carrier. The tax must be imposed upon the basis of that information. If any company fails to make the report required under this chapter on or before the first day of May of any year, the state board of equalization shall add a penalty of one-quarter of the tax due for failure to make the required report which must be collected as a part of the tax, but the tax commissioner, upon application, may grant extensions of time within which the returns must be filed. For good cause shown, the tax commissioner may waive all or any part of the penalty that attached under this section.

If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one specific jurisdiction within the enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for the enhanced zip code for each level of taxing jurisdiction.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Each person engaged in the business of selling cigarettes, cigarette papers, snuff, cigars, or tobacco in this state, including any distributor or dealer, must secure a license from the attorney general before engaging or continuing to engage in business. A separate application and license is required for each distributor at each outlet or place of business within the state, and a separate dealer’s license is required for each retail outlet when a person owns or controls more than one place of business dealing in cigarettes, cigarette papers, snuff, cigars, or tobacco. No retailer will be granted a distributor’s license except a retailer who, in the usual course of business, performed a distributor’s or wholesaler’s function for at least one year prior to filing the license application. The application prescribed by the attorney general must include the name and address of the applicant, the address and place of business, the type of business, and other information as required for the proper administration of this chapter. Each application for a wholesale or distributor’s outlet license must be accompanied by a fee of twenty-five dollars and a surety bond approved by the attorney general. Each application for a dealer’s outlet license must be accompanied by a fee of fifteen dollars. A reinstatement fee of fifty dollars is required in addition to the annual license fee for each license renewal applied for after June thirtieth. The total reinstatement fee may not exceed five hundred dollars for any one licensee in any fiscal year. A distributor’s license does not authorize the holder to make retail sales. Each license issued must be prominently displayed on the premises covered by the license.

      <li id="t57c57-36s57-36-14ol15">
       In the event that no demand for judicial determination is made, the seized property must be deemed forfeited to the state by operation of law, and the tax commissioner shall destroy the same.

       In case of the seizure of an automobile, truck, boat, airplane, conveyance, vehicle, or other means of transportation pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the officer making the seizure shall file an inventory, and upon a demand for a judicial determination as provided in this section, the tax commissioner, within thirty days thereafter, shall commence an action in the district court of the county where such seizure was made to declare a forfeiture of such vehicle or other means of transportation, and such action must be heard and determined as other forfeiture actions instituted under this chapter.

For the purposes of this section, the term “wholesale purchase price” means the established price for which a manufacturer sells cigars or pipe tobacco to a distributor exclusive of any discount or other reduction. However, the dealer may elect to report and remit the tax on the cost price of the products to the dealer rather than on the wholesale purchase price. The proceeds of the tax, together with the forms of return and in accordance with any rules and regulations the tax commissioner may prescribe, must be remitted to the tax commissioner by the dealer on a monthly basis on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the monthly period for which it is paid.

      </p>
      <p>
       “The legislative intent is to not tax property transferred upon death. It is the intent of the legislative assembly to repeal the state estate tax to the extent possible without jeopardizing that portion of federal estate taxes which is allowed as a credit for state estate taxes. It is recognized that, if the state estate tax were totally repealed, the amount of federal estate taxes due would be increased by the amount of credit at no savings to the people of North Dakota”.

      <li id="t57c57-37.1s57-37.1-04ol11">
       The amount of tax imposed upon the transfer of the North Dakota taxable estate must be equal to the maximum tax credit allowable for state death taxes against the federal estate tax imposed with respect to a decedent’s estate which has a taxable situs in this state. If only a portion of a decedent’s estate has a taxable situs in this state, such maximum tax credit must be determined by multiplying the entire amount of the credit allowable against the federal estate tax for state death taxes by the percentage which the value of the portion of the decedent’s estate which has a taxable situs in this state bears to the value of the entire estate. For the purposes of this section, “federal estate tax” means the tax imposed on transfers of estates of decedents pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, and “North Dakota taxable estate” means all property in a decedent’s federal gross estate that has a situs in North Dakota.
      </li>

       When property subject to the tax imposed by this chapter qualifies for valuation based on its use under section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code, it has the same value for North Dakota estate tax purposes as it has for federal estate tax purposes. If, after the final determination of the tax imposed by this chapter, the property valued under section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code is transferred or otherwise fails to qualify and an additional tax is imposed under section 2032A(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, any increase in the credit for state death taxes must be reported by the personal representative to the tax commissioner within ninety days after final determination of the increased credit. Upon notification, the tax commissioner shall reassess the estate tax.

       The tax commissioner shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter and shall pay over the same to the state treasurer at the end of each calendar month and at the time of payment shall provide the state treasurer with a listing of estates of decedents from which the taxes were collected, together with a certificate as to the location and value of real estate and personal property for each estate. If the decedent was a resident of this state at the time of death, the certificate must also show the situs of those items of intangible personal property, if any, for which the decedent’s will had, in accordance with subsection 6 of section 57-37.1-01, specified a situs different from that of the decedent’s residence at the time of death.

       Following the end of each calendar quarterly period, the state treasurer shall pay over to the county treasurer of the appropriate county, for its general fund, the amount of tax collected on the transfer of the property in that county. If any part of the decedent’s property at the time of the decedent’s death had a legal situs within the limits of a city, the share of tax based on such property must be divided by the state treasurer between the city and the county in proportion to their respective mill levies, except school levies, for the calendar year preceding the year of death. If any part of the decedent’s property had a legal situs outside the limits of a city, the share of tax based on said property must go entirely to the county. If the tax determined to be due pursuant to this chapter is in an amount which is one hundred dollars or less, no further apportionment pursuant to this section may be made and the entire amount due must be distributed to a county or counties in which the legal situs of the property is located for their general fund.

       In case an overpayment of such tax has been made for the estate of a decedent, such overpayment must be repaid out of any undistributed estate taxes in the hands of the state treasurer upon an order of the tax commissioner. Any overpayment to be repaid must bear interest at the Bank of North Dakota’s money market demand account rate on the date of the tax commissioner’s order to the state treasurer. Interest is to be computed from the time the tax was paid until the overpayment is repaid. Any interest owed by the state must be paid by the state treasurer from the general fund appropriation for miscellaneous refunds approved by the legislative assembly. The state treasurer shall thereupon present and file with the appropriate county treasurers and city auditors a verified claim of such overpayment accompanied by a copy of the order of the tax commissioner for such refund and the county treasurers and city auditors shall pay such claim to the state treasurer.

       “Chronically mentally ill” means a person who, as a result of a mental disorder, exhibits emotional or behavioral functioning which is so impaired as to interfere substantially with the person’s capacity to remain in the community without verified supportive treatment or services of a long-term or indefinite duration. This mental disability must be severe and persistent, resulting in a long-term limitation of the person’s functional capacities for primary activities of daily living such as interpersonal relationships, homemaking, self-care, employment, and recreation.

     <p>
      It is the intent of the legislative assembly to simplify the state income tax laws and to demonstrate that federal legislation is not necessary to deal with certain interstate tax problems, by adopting the federal definition of taxable income as the starting point for the computation of state income tax by all taxpayers and providing the necessary adjustments thereto to substantially preserve and maintain existing exemptions and deductions. It is the further intent of the legislative assembly to eliminate double taxation of the earnings of small corporations by recognizing a subchapter S election when made for federal income tax purposes.

        The State Tax Commissioner’s method of treating the federal income tax deduction allowed by this section did not violate claimant’s equal protection rights on the theory that it arbitrarily discriminates between corporations with positive United States source incomes and those with negative United States source incomes where a rational basis could be found for the classification.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol11">
       Any corporation organized under the laws of North Dakota and subject to a tax under the provisions of this chapter, which maintains no regular place of business outside this state, except a statutory office, must be taxed upon its entire income.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol12">
       Corporations engaged in business within and without this state may be taxed only on such income as is derived from business transacted and property located within this state. The amount of such income apportionable to North Dakota must be determined as provided in chapter 57-38.1.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol13">
       Any corporation liable to report under this chapter and owning or controlling, either directly or indirectly, substantially all of the voting capital stock of another corporation, or of other corporations, may be required to make a consolidated report showing the combined income, such assets of the corporation as are required for the purposes of this chapter, and such other information as the tax commissioner may require, but excluding intercorporate stock holdings and intercorporate accounts.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol14">
       Any corporation liable to report under this chapter and owned or controlled either directly or indirectly by another corporation may be required to make a report consolidated with the owning company, showing the combined income, such assets of the corporation as are required for the purposes of this chapter, and such other information as the tax commissioner may require, but excluding intercorporate stock holdings and intercorporate accounts.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol15">
       In case it appears to the tax commissioner that any arrangement exists in such a manner as to reflect improperly the business done, the segregable assets, or the entire income earned from business done in this state, the tax commissioner is authorized and empowered, in such manner as the tax commissioner may determine, to adjust the tax equitably.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol16">
       The tax commissioner may permit or require the filing of a combined report if substantially all the voting capital stock of two or more corporations liable to report under this chapter is owned or controlled by the same interests. The tax commissioner may impose the tax provided by this chapter as though the combined entire income and segregated assets were those of one corporation, but in the computation, dividends received from any corporation whose assets, as distinguished from shares of stock, are included in the segregations may not be included in the income.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol17">
       When any corporation required to make a return under this chapter conducts the business, whether under agreement or otherwise, in such manner as directly or indirectly to benefit the members or stockholders of the corporation, or any of them, or any person or persons, directly or indirectly interested in such business, by selling its products, or the goods or commodities in which it deals, at less than a fair price which might be obtained therefor, or if such a corporation, a substantial portion of whose capital stock is owned either directly or indirectly by another corporation, acquires and disposes of the products of the corporation owning the substantial portion of its capital stock, in such manner as to create a loss or improper income, the tax commissioner may require such facts as the tax commissioner deems necessary for the proper computation provided by this chapter, and for the purposes of this chapter may determine the amount which must be deemed to be the entire income, of the business of such corporation for the calendar or fiscal year. In determining such entire income, the tax commissioner shall have regard to the fair profits which, but for any agreement, arrangement, or understanding, might be or could have been obtained from dealing in such products, goods, or commodities.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol18">
       If it appears to the tax commissioner that the segregation of assets shown by any report made under this chapter does not reflect properly the corporate activity or business done, or the income earned from corporate activity, or from business done in this state because of the character of the corporation’s business and the character and location of its assets, the tax commissioner is authorized and empowered to adjust the tax equitably.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-14ol19">
       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, two or more North Dakota domestic corporations, affiliated as parent and subsidiary, and filing a federal consolidated tax return, shall file a combined report and consolidated return for income tax under this chapter.

Provided, that for purposes of this section, any person required to file a state income tax return under this chapter, but who has not computed a federal taxable income figure, shall compute a federal taxable income figure using a pro forma return in order to determine a federal taxable income figure to be used as a starting point in computing state income tax under this section.

     <p>
      A taxpayer is entitled to a credit against tax liability determined under section 57-38-30 in the amount of ten percent per year for five years of the taxpayer’s direct costs incurred after December 31, 2002, to adapt or add equipment to retrofit an existing facility or construction of a new facility in this state for the purpose of producing or blending diesel fuel containing at least two percent biodiesel fuel or green diesel fuel by volume or of the taxpayer’s direct costs incurred after December 31, 2008, to adapt or add equipment to retrofit an existing facility or construction of a new facility in this state for the purpose of producing crushed soybeans or canola. For purposes of this section, “biodiesel” and “green diesel” mean fuel as defined in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-43.2s57-43.2-01" target="_self">57-43.2-01.</a></cite> The credit under this section may not exceed the taxpayer’s liability as determined under this chapter for the taxable year and each year’s credit amount may be carried forward for up to five taxable years. A taxpayer is limited to two hundred fifty thousand dollars in the cumulative amount of credits under this section for all taxable years. A taxpayer may not claim a credit under this section for any taxable year before the taxable year in which the facility begins production or blending of diesel fuel containing at least two percent biodiesel fuel or green diesel fuel by volume or begins crushing soybeans or canola, but eligible costs incurred before the taxable year production, blending, or crushing begins may be claimed for purposes of the credit under this section for taxable years on or after the taxable year production, blending, or crushing begins.

        Filing a tax return requires filing a tax form containing sufficient required information from which a tax liability can be determined; filing a form with the word “objection” written to every required response except name, address, and amount of tax withheld and claimed as a refund did not constitute filing a return.

      Each corporation that receives income from the sources designated in section 57-38-14, whether or not required to file an income tax return pursuant to the provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, shall, unless exempted by the provisions of section 57-38-09, make a return in such form as the tax commissioner may prescribe, stating specifically such facts as the tax commissioner may require for the purpose of making any computation required by this chapter. Any corporation which is required to file a state income tax return but not required to compute a federal taxable income figure for federal income tax purposes is required to compute such a federal taxable income figure using a pro forma return pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, in order to determine a starting point for the computation of state income tax. Any foreign loan and investment company engaged in business in this state, and whose income in this state consists solely of income exempt from taxation under this chapter, need not file an annual report unless specially requested to do so by the tax commissioner, but may file in lieu thereof an affidavit claiming exemption under this chapter. The return must be signed by the president, vice president, treasurer, assistant treasurer, chief accounting officer, or any other officer duly authorized so to act and it and any other declaration, statement, or document required to be made must contain or be verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner may prescribe alternative methods for signing, subscribing, or verifying a return filed by electronic means, including telecommunications, that shall have the same validity and consequence as the actual signature and written declaration for a paper return.

     <p>
      If the tax commissioner is of the opinion that any person has failed to include in a return as filed, or to provide during the course of an audit, either intentionally or through error or for any other reason, information necessary to properly determine North Dakota taxable income, the tax commissioner may require from that person an amended return or any supplementary information as is necessary to properly and accurately determine a person’s North Dakota taxable income, in the form as the tax commissioner shall prescribe. If the person fails or refuses to file the amended return or to furnish the supplementary information requested, the tax commissioner may, after thirty days’ notice, determine the North Dakota taxable income of the person from the best information available and assess any tax due, including interest and penalty. If the tax commissioner finds that the taxpayer’s failure to provide an amended return or supplementary information was unreasonable and willful, the assessment of tax is final as to the tax commissioner. A North Dakota district court may reverse the tax commissioner’s assessment only if it finds that the taxpayer’s failure was not willful or that the tax commissioner’s request was unreasonable.

        Assessment of Additional Tax.

      <p>
       The provision of this section requiring tax commissioner to audit the report of taxpayer and not later than three years after due date of the return assess any additional tax found due is a limitation upon the right to make such additional assessment rather than upon the remedy and no explanation as to why proceedings were not taken within the time prescribed will toll the statute or prevent the bar. Langer v. Gray, 75 N.D. 1, 25 N.W.2d 89, 1946 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1946).

       When tax is understated on a return because of a mathematical or clerical error, the tax commissioner shall notify the person of the nature of the error and the amount of additional tax due. This notice is not a notice of deficiency and the person has no right to protest.

      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-39ol12">
       If upon audit the tax commissioner finds additional tax due, the tax commissioner shall notify the person of the deficiency in the tax payment. Such notice of deficiency must be sent first-class mail and must assess the amount of additional tax due and set forth the reasons for the increase.

      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-39ol13">
       A person has thirty days, ninety days if the person is outside the United States, to file a written protest objecting to the tax commissioner’s assessment of additional tax due. The protest must set forth the basis for the protest and any other information which may be required by the tax commissioner. If a person fails to file a written protest within the time provided, the amount of additional tax assessed in the notice of deficiency becomes finally and irrevocably fixed. If a person protests only a portion of the tax commissioner’s finding, the portion which is not protested becomes finally and irrevocably fixed.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-39ol14">
       If a protest is filed, the tax commissioner shall reconsider the assessment of additional tax due. The reconsideration may include further examination by the tax commissioner or the tax commissioner’s representative of a person’s books, papers, records, or memoranda. The tax commissioner, upon request, may grant the person an informal conference.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-39ol15">
       Within a reasonable time after the protest, the tax commissioner shall mail to the taxpayer a notice of reconsideration and assessment which must respond to the person’s protest and assess the amount of additional tax due. The amount set forth in that notice becomes finally and irrevocably fixed unless the person within thirty days commences formal administrative review as provided for in chapter 28-32 by the filing of a complaint.

      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-39ol16">
       Upon written request, the tax commissioner may grant an extension of time to file a protest as provided for in subsection 3 or an extension of time to commence formal review as provided in subsection 5.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38s57-38-39ol17">
       In all cases in which the tax commissioner finds that a person has an obligation to file an income tax return in North Dakota and has failed to do so, the tax commissioner shall notify the person by first-class mail of the tax commissioner’s finding and of the remedies provided for in sections 57-38-33, 57-38-45, and 57-38-47. The remedies provided for in the above-listed sections are mutually exclusive and if a person fails to file an income tax return after being notified, the tax commissioner may elect a remedy under which to proceed. If the tax commissioner elects to take the action provided for in section 57-38-33 or subsection 6 of section 57-38-45, the amount so assessed is not reviewable.

        A taxpayer who did not file a complaint to review the tax commissioner’s determination within thirty days was not entitled to statutory review. Hoover Grain Co. v. Thoresen, 58 N.D. 359, 226 N.W. 521, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 219</cite> (N.D. 1929).

        Former subsection (4) of this section (now subsection (9)) required that amended returns for tax refunds be accompanied by a statement outlining the “specific grounds” upon which the refund claim is based. The obvious purpose for such a requirement in the complex area of tax law is to delineate and restrict the issues to be considered in a taxpayer’s refund action in order to lessen administrative and judicial burdens.

        The provisions of S.L. 1923, ch. 312 for the refund of excessive or illegal income taxes were intended to operate only prospectively and did not apply to payments under prior income tax laws.

        No interest can be allowed upon a claim for refund of income tax payments illegally imposed and collected. Ford Motor Co. v. Baker, 71 N.D. 298, 300 N.W. 435, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 1941).

        Where action has been taken upon an application of a taxpayer that results in the denial of his complaint and the statutory time for review is permitted to elapse so that the adjudication of the income tax becomes final, the final character of the determination is not obviated by a second application which seeks relief upon the same grounds as the first.

        The word “subrental” is not defined in this section, and the court must therefore look to its commonly understood meaning; thus, under this section, subrentals are the payments a subtenant makes to the original lessee.

      It is the intent of the legislative assembly to establish a policy and to provide a system whereby all claimant agencies of the state of North Dakota, in conjunction with the commissioner, shall cooperate in identifying debtors who owe money to the state through its various claimant agencies and who qualify for refunds approved by the commissioner. It is also the intent of this chapter to establish procedures for setting off against any such refund the sum of any debt owed to the state. To this end, this chapter should be liberally construed.

       Because the statute of limitations did not bar a past due child support debt or affect other remedies, a subsequent attempt to collect the debt through the administrative tax intercept procedures did not constitute a collateral attack on the prior order, where the prior order held only that the remedy sought therein, collection of the arrearages through a Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act (URESA) proceeding, was unavailable. The subsequent use of the tax intercept procedures did not attempt to avoid, defeat, or evade that determination, nor to deny its force and effect. Guthmiller v.

      If a taxpayer makes a qualified investment in a qualified business, the taxpayer is entitled to a credit against state income tax liability as determined under section 57-38-30 or <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-38s57-38-30" target="_self">57-38-30.</a></cite>3.

       The amount of the credit to which a taxpayer is entitled is thirty percent of the amount invested by the taxpayer in qualified businesses during the taxable year.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-38.6s57-38.6-03ol12">
       The maximum annual credit a taxpayer may obtain under this section is fifty thousand dollars and no taxpayer may obtain more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars in credits under this section over any combination of taxable years. This subsection may not be interpreted to limit additional investment by a taxpayer for which that taxpayer is not applying for a credit.

      <li id="t57c57-38.6s57-38.6-03ol13">
       The credit under this section may not exceed the liability for tax under chapter 57-38. If the amount of credit under this section exceeds the liability for tax, the excess may be carried forward for up to ten taxable years after the taxable year in which the investment was made.

The amount of the total credit determined at the passthrough entity level must be allowed to the passthrough entity’s partners, shareholders, or members in proportion to their respective ownership interests in the passthrough entity.

       The investment must be made on or after the certification effective date and must be at risk in the business to be eligible for the tax credit under this section. A qualified investment must be in the form of a purchase of ownership interests or the right to receive payment of dividends from the business. An investment for which a credit is received under this section must remain in the business for at least three years. An investment placed in escrow does not qualify for the credit.

        Because the plant fuel used by gas processors in their operations did not become an integral, or an ingredient, or component part of other products intended to be sold ultimately at retail, but was consumed by the processors and never resold, it was not personal property that was “processed” and so the exclusion “for processing or for resale” under former subdivision 7 (now subdivision 21) of this section did not apply.

        Because plant fuel is consumed by certain natural gas processing plants in their operations, the fuel is purchased at retail and thus subject to sales or use taxes. Rocky Mountain Oil &amp; Gas Ass'n v. Conrad, 405 N.W.2d 279, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 306</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        When raw material is purchased for the purpose of processing or manufacturing, the taxpayer does not at that point pay a retail sales tax; however, when the taxpayer converts to its own use some of the raw material, the “for processing” exclusion under former subdivision 7 (now subdivision 21) of this section no longer applies.

        Where natural gas processors took possession of all the raw gas produced at the wellhead, processed that gas, and sold the products of processing to third parties pursuant to the terms of their standard gas purchase contracts, paying a pro rata “pass-through” percentage of whatever price the processor received for the plant products from the third-party purchaser, without paying a fixed price for the raw gas collected from their wells, nor receiving a flat fee for their processing services, and the contracts also provided that the processors were entitled to burn some of the raw gas in the course of plant operations, the incidental use of plant fuel under these circumstances constituted a “retail sale” as defined by this section.

        If retailer quotes a delivered price to a customer, then such price becomes the retail price, and sales and use tax will be computed upon the whole amount; but where the cost of transportation is added onto a quoted retail price and stated separately on the seller’s invoice, receipts from transportation charges are not subject to tax; the statutory exemption of transportation costs is not limited to those who deal primarily in freight and passenger service, but also applies to retailers of goods who incidentally, but separately, provide transportation service; thus, where sales of drilling mud were made at taxpayer’s warehouse and there were separate negotiations regarding its transportation to the oil field, receipts from transportation charges were not taxable.

        When the legislature amended subdivision 22 of this section to include the “same person” restriction, the legislature intended to restrict the sales tax exemption to situations where the same natural person or natural persons occupy an accommodation for 30 consecutive days or more. Under the amended version of this section, corporations are not “persons;” accordingly, corporations that rent rooms for their employees are subject to sales tax, unless the same employee or employees occupy the accommodation for 30 consecutive days or more.

       Gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property used to construct or expand a qualified straddle plant, a qualified fractionator, or qualified associated infrastructure in this state are exempt from the tax imposed under this chapter. To qualify for the exemption, the tangible personal property must be incorporated into a qualifying straddle plant or a qualifying fractionator plant, or used in the construction process to the point of having no residual economic value. Replacement of tangible personal property does not qualify for the exemption under this section unless the replacement creates an expansion of the plant or qualified associated infrastructure.

The tax commissioner may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirement to file and remit monthly.

Penalties and interest for failure to file a return, for filing an incorrect return, or for failure to pay the tax due are those prescribed in section 57-39.2-18. If the total of sales subject to the tax decreases below three hundred thirty-three thousand dollars for any succeeding year, the retailer may return to quarterly filing and payments. When there is a sale of any business by any retailer or when any business is discontinued by a retailer, the tax becomes due immediately prior to the sale or discontinuance of the business and if not paid within fifteen days thereafter it becomes delinquent and subject to the penalties provided in section 57-39.2-18. In the event of a business reorganization in which the ownership of the business organization remains in the same person or persons as prior to the reorganization, the total sales subject to sales and use taxes for the preceding calendar year for the business that was reorganized must be used to determine whether the tax is payable monthly under this subsection.

      If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the commissioner shall determine the amount of tax due from any information as the commissioner may be able to obtain, and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices, such as number of employees of the person concerned, rentals paid by the person, the person’s stock on hand, and other factors. The commissioner shall give notice of the determination to the person liable for the tax. If the determination of tax due relates to an incorrect or insufficient return filed by a taxpayer, notice of the determination must be given not later than three years after the last day on which the return was due or three years after the return was filed, whichever period expires later; if it is determined upon audit that the tax due was twenty-five percent or more above the amount reported on a return, notice of determination of tax due must be given not later than six years after the last day on which the return was due or six years after the return was filed, whichever is later. Notice of determination of tax due for any reporting period for which a taxpayer failed to file a return must be given not later than six years after the due date of the return but if fraudulent information is given in a return or the failure to file a return is due to the fraudulent intent or willful attempt of the taxpayer in any manner to evade the tax, the time limitation herein provided for giving notice of the determination of tax due does not apply. The determination of tax due fixes the tax finally and irrevocably unless the person against whom it is assessed, within thirty days after the giving of notice of the determination, protests the determination under rules adopted by the commissioner and under chapter 28-32.

    Sales tax holidays.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol11">
       If a member state allows for temporary exemption periods, commonly referred to as sales tax holidays, the member state shall:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol11a">
         Not apply an exemption unless the items to be exempted are specifically defined in part II or part III(B) of the library of definitions and the exemptions are uniformly applied to state and local sales and use taxes.
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol11b">
         Provide notice of the exemption period at least sixty days prior to the first day of the calendar month in which the exemption period will begin.
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol11c">
         Not apply an entity-based or use-based exemption except a member state may limit a product-based exemption to items purchased for personal or nonbusiness use.
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol11d">
         Not require a seller to obtain an exemption certificate or other certification from a purchaser for items to be exempted during a sales tax holiday.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol12">
       A member state may establish a sales tax holiday that utilizes price thresholds set by such state and the provisions of the agreement on the use of thresholds shall not apply to exemptions provided by a state during a sales tax holiday. In order to provide uniformity, a price threshold established by a member state for exempt items shall include only items priced below the threshold. A member state shall not exempt only a portion of the price of an individual item during a sales tax holiday.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13">
       The following procedures are to be used by member states in administering a sales tax holiday exemption:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13a">
         Layaway sales. A sale of eligible property under a layaway sale qualifies for exemption if:
         <ol>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13a1">
           Final payment on a layaway order is made by, and the property is given to, the purchaser during the exemption period; or
          </li>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13a2">
           The purchaser selects the property and the retailer accepts the order for the item during the exemption period, for immediate delivery upon full payment, even if delivery is made after the exemption period.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13b">
         Bundled sales. Member states will follow the same procedure during the sales tax holiday as agreed upon for handling a bundled sale at other times.
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13c">
         Discounts and coupons. A discount by a seller reduces the sales price of the property and the discounted sales price determines whether the sales price is within a sales tax holiday price threshold of a member state. A coupon that reduces the sales price is treated as a discount if the seller is not reimbursed for the coupon amount by a third party. If a discount applies to the total amount paid by a purchaser rather than to the sales price of a particular item and the purchaser has purchased both eligible property and taxable property, the seller shall allocate the discount based on the total sales prices of the taxable property compared to the total sales prices of all property sold in that same transaction.
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13d">
         Splitting of items normally sold together. Items that are normally sold as a single unit must continue to be sold in that manner and cannot be priced separately and sold as individual items in order to obtain a sales tax holiday.
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13e">
         Rainchecks. A raincheck is a means to allow a customer to purchase an item at a certain price at a later time because the particular item was out of stock. Eligible property that is purchased during the exemption period with use of a raincheck qualifies for the exemption regardless of when the raincheck was issued. Issuance of a raincheck during the exemption period does not qualify eligible property for the exemption if the property is purchased after the exemption period.
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13f">
         Exchanges. The procedure for an exchange of eligible property purchased during a sales tax holiday is as follows:
         <ol>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13f1">
           If a customer purchases an item of eligible property during the exemption period, and later exchanges the item for a similar eligible item, even if a different size, different color, or other feature, no additional tax is due if the exchange is made after the exemption period.
          </li>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13f2">
           If a customer purchases an item of eligible property during the exemption period, and returns the item and receives credit on the purchase of a different item after the exemption period, the appropriate sales tax is due on the sale of the newly purchased item.
          </li>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13f3">
           If a customer purchases an item of eligible property before the exemption period, returns the item, and receives credit on the purchase of a different item of eligible property during the exemption period, no sales tax is due on the sale of the new item if the new item is purchased during the exemption period.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13g">
         Delivery charges. Delivery charges, including shipping, handling, and service charges, are part of the sales price of eligible property unless a member state defines “sales price” to exclude such charges. For the purpose of determining a sales tax holiday price threshold, if all the property in a shipment qualifies as eligible property and the sales price for each item in the shipment is within the sales tax holiday price threshold, the seller does not have to allocate the delivery charge to determine if the price threshold is exceeded and the shipment will be considered a sale of eligible products. If the shipment includes eligible property and taxable property, including an eligible item with a sales price in excess of the price threshold, the seller should allocate the delivery charge by using:
         <ol>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13g1">
           A percentage based on the total sales prices of the taxable property compared to the total sales prices of all property in the shipment; or
          </li>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13g2">
           A percentage based on the total weight of the taxable property compared to the total weight of all property in the shipment. The seller must tax the percentage of the delivery charge allocated to the taxable property but is not required to tax the percentage allocated to the eligible property.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13h">
         Order date and back orders. For the purpose of a sales tax holiday, eligible property qualifies for exemption if:
         <ol>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13h1">
           The item is both delivered to and paid for by the customer during the exemption period; or
          </li>
          <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13h2">
           The customer orders and pays for the item and the seller accepts the order during the exemption period for immediate shipment, even if delivery is made after the exemption period. For purposes of this subsection, the seller accepts an order when the seller has taken action to fill the order for immediate shipment. Actions to fill an order include placement of an “in date” stamp on a mail order or assignment of an “order number” to a telephone order. An order is for immediate shipment when the customer does not request delayed shipment. An order is for immediate shipment notwithstanding that the shipment may be delayed because of a backlog of orders or because stock is currently unavailable to or on back order by the seller.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13i">
         Returns. For a sixty-day period immediately after the sales tax holiday exemption period, when a customer returns an item that would qualify for the exemption, no credit for or refund of sales tax shall be given unless the customer provides a receipt or invoice that shows tax was paid, or the seller has sufficient documentation to show that tax was paid on the specific item. This sixty day period is solely for the purpose of designating a time period during which the customer must provide documentation that shows that sales tax was paid on returned merchandise. The sixty-day period does not require the seller to change the seller’s policy on the time period during which the seller will accept returns.
        </li>
        <li id="t57c57-39.4s57-39.4-23ol13j">
         Different time zones. The time zone of the seller’s location determines the authorized time period for a sales tax holiday when the purchaser is located in one time zone and a seller is located in another.

For purposes of this section, an “end user” includes any person other than a person who receives by contract a product transferred electronically for further commercial broadcast, rebroadcast, transmission, retransmission, licensing, relicensing, distribution, redistribution, or exhibition of the product, in whole or in part, to another person or persons. A person who purchases products transferred electronically, or the code for specified digital products for the purpose of giving away such products or code shall not be considered to have engaged in the distribution or redistribution of such products or code and shall be treated as an end user.

For purposes of this section “permanent” means perpetual or for an indefinite or unspecified length of time. A right of permanent use shall be presumed to have been granted unless the agreement between the seller and the purchaser specifies or the circumstances surrounding the transaction suggest or indicate that the right to use terminates on the occurrence of a condition subsequent.

       The taxes subject to an agreement under this section are the state’s alcoholic beverages wholesale taxes under chapters 5-01, 5-02, and 5-03, as may be amended subsequently by the legislative assembly, for alcoholic beverages sold by licensed wholesalers, domestic wineries, domestic distilleries, microbrew pubs, brewer taproom licensees, and direct shippers, for delivery to licensed retailers or sale directly to consumers located within the exterior boundaries of the Fort Berthold Reservation, that portion of the Lake Traverse Reservation located in this state, the Spirit Lake Reservation, that portion of the Standing Rock Reservation located in this state, or the Turtle Mountain Reservation.

       Chapters 5-01, 5-02, and 5-03, and title 81 of the North Dakota Administrative Code govern the collection and administration of the taxes subject to an agreement under this section.

       The amount of tax revenue allocated to the tribe pursuant to an agreement under this section must be equal to an amount determined by multiplying the enrolled membership of the tribe by the state alcohol revenue per capita. The state alcohol revenue per capita is the quarterly collections of the state’s alcoholic beverages wholesale taxes designated for deposit in the state general fund divided by the state’s total population as determined in the most recent actual or estimated census data published by the United States census bureau.

       Except as provided in subsection 6 of section 57-39.10-02, the enrolled membership of the tribe must be certified to the state by September thirtieth of each year during the term of the agreement. The enrolled membership of the tribe must consist of the number of enrolled members of the tribe physically residing within the exterior boundaries of the portion of the tribe’s reservation located in this state. The enrolled membership of the tribe must be based on the tribe’s enrollment office records, the bureau of Indian affairs enrollment records, or other records maintained by the tribe. The previous year’s certified enrollment number must be used if the tribe does not issue a certification by September thirtieth, unless the tribe demonstrates the certified enrollment number has increased or decreased. The manner in which the state and tribe resolve issues arising under this subsection must be specified in the agreement.

       An excise tax is imposed on the fair market value of sand or gravel severed when sand or gravel is not sold at retail as tangible personal property by the person severing the sand or gravel. If the sand or gravel is not sold at retail by the person severing the sand or gravel, it must be presumed until the contrary is shown by the commissioner or by the person severing the sand or gravel that the fair market value is eight cents per ton of two thousand pounds [907.18 kilograms]. If records are not kept as to the tonnage of sand or gravel severed from the soil, it must be presumed for the purpose of this chapter that one cubic yard [764.55 liters] of sand or gravel is equal to one and one-half tons [1360.78 kilograms] of sand or gravel.

        Considering that N.D.C.C. §
   43-07-01 provides a clear and thorough definition of the term “contractor” consistent with the references to contractor activities contained in N.D.C.C. §
   57-40.2-14, which is part of the use tax section of the code and discusses contractors involved in “the erection of buildings or the alteration, improvement or repair of real property,” the definition of “contractor” used in N.D.C.C. §
   43-07-01 was held to apply to the term “contractor” used in this section. Northern X-Ray Co. v. State by &amp; Through Hanson, 542 N.W.2d 733, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 25</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxpayer was not a contractor under the definition provided in N.D.C.C. §
   43-07-01, where it assembled certain items of medical equipment in clinics, which were all put in place within a matter of days and could be equally easily removed, it was not registered as a contractor, and was not in the business of altering, repairing or improving real property; therefore, taxpayer was not liable for payment of contractor use tax under this section. Northern X-Ray Co. v. State by &amp; Through Hanson, 542 N.W.2d 733, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 25</cite> (N.D. 1996).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislative history underlying this section shows that it was designed to solve the problem of contractors avoiding taxes on materials used in work for tax-exempt entities by entering into a “two-contract agreement,” in which the tax-exempt entity would buy the needed materials and then hire a contractor to install them. Northern X-Ray Co. v. State by &amp; Through Hanson, 542 N.W.2d 733, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 25</cite> (N.D. 1996).

Each such retailer shall list with the commissioner the name and address of all of the retailer’s agents operating in this state and the location of each of the retailer’s distribution or sales houses or offices or other places of business in this state.

       The commissioner, upon application, may authorize the collection of the tax imposed by this chapter by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within the state, who, to the satisfaction of the commissioner, furnishes adequate security to ensure collections and payment of the tax. To such retailer must be issued a permit to collect the tax in such manner and subject to such regulations and agreements as the commissioner shall prescribe. When so authorized, such retailer shall, except as otherwise provided in subsection 1 of section 57-40.2-06, collect the tax upon all tangible property sold to the retailer’s knowledge for use within this state, as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state collects such tax. Such authority and permit may be canceled at any time, if the commissioner considers the security inadequate, or believes that such tax can be collected more effectively from the person using such property in this state.

Except that when there is a sale of any business by any retailer required or authorized, pursuant to this section, to collect such tax or when any business is discontinued by such retailer, the tax becomes due immediately prior to the sale or discontinuance of such business and, if not paid within fifteen days thereafter, it becomes delinquent and subject to the penalties provided in section 57-40.2-15. Every retailer, at the time of making the return required by this chapter, shall compute and pay to the commissioner the tax due for the preceding period.

If such extension is granted to any retailer, the time in which the retailer is required to make payment must be extended for the same period. If the commissioner deems it necessary or advisable in order to ensure the payment of the tax, or if the commissioner deems it practical, the commissioner may require returns and payment of the tax to be made for annual periods or other than quarterly periods, the provisions of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding. A return must be signed by the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s duly authorized agent and must contain a written declaration that it is made and subscribed under penalties of this chapter.

       If total sales and purchases subject to sales and use taxes for the preceding calendar year equal or exceed three hundred thirty-three thousand dollars, the tax levied by this chapter is payable monthly on or before the last day of the next succeeding month. The tax commissioner may, upon request and for good cause shown, waive the requirement to file and remit monthly. The amount of monthly tax payable, manner of payment, filing of the return, penalty, and waiver of penalty must be that prescribed in subsection 1 of section 57-39.2-12. Penalty and interest for failure to file a return or corrected return or to pay the tax imposed must be that prescribed in section 57-40.2-15. If a person is required to file more than one return pursuant to this section, the monthly payment requirement applies separately to each return. If total sales and purchases subject to sales and use taxes for any succeeding calendar year decrease below three hundred thirty-three thousand dollars, a person may return to quarterly installments. In the event of a business reorganization in which the ownership of the business organization remains in the same person or persons as prior to the reorganization, the total sales subject to sales and use taxes for the preceding calendar year for the business that was reorganized must be used to determine whether the tax is payable monthly under this section.

       The commissioner, when in the commissioner’s judgment it is necessary and advisable to do so in order to secure the collection of such tax, may require any person subject to the tax to file with the commissioner a bond, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the insurance commissioner as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as the commissioner may fix, to secure the payment of any tax or penalties due or which may become due from such person. In lieu of such bond, securities approved by the commissioner, in an amount which the commissioner may prescribe, may be deposited with the commissioner, and such securities must be kept in the custody of the commissioner, and may be sold by the commissioner at public or private sale, without notice to the depositor thereof, if it becomes necessary so to do in order to recover any tax or penalties due. Upon such sale, the surplus, if any remains above the amounts due, must be returned to the person who deposited the securities.

    Contractor’s performance bonds for payment of use tax.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purposes of this section, the term “contractor” includes any person or group or combination of persons acting as a unit; “subcontractor” includes a person or group or combination of persons acting as a unit, who undertakes to perform all or any part of work covered by the original contract entered into by the contractor, including the furnishing of any supplies, materials, equipment, or any other tangible personal property; “surety” means a bond or undertaking executed by a surety company authorized to do business in this state; and “surety company” means any person executing the surety.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any contractor or subcontractor enters into any contract for the erection of buildings or the alteration, improvement, or repair of real property in this state and the contractor or subcontractor furnishes surety for the faithful performance of such contract, there is hereby imposed the additional obligation upon the surety company to the state of North Dakota that said contractor or subcontractor shall promptly pay all use taxes which may accrue to the state of North Dakota under this chapter. In the case of a contractor and the contractor’s surety company, this additional obligation shall include liability to pay to the commissioner on purchases made by either the contractor or the subcontractor all such use taxes which have not been paid to a retailer authorized or required to collect such taxes; and the contractor or the contractor’s surety company may recover from the subcontractor the amount of any use taxes accruing with respect to purchases made by the subcontractor which the contractor or the surety company may be required to pay to the commissioner, or to withhold from the amount due the subcontractor under the subcontract an amount equal to any use taxes accruing with respect to purchases of the subcontractor which have not been paid by the subcontractor to the commissioner or to a retailer authorized or required to collect such taxes. Such liability on the part of the surety company is limited to three percent of the amount of the contract price.
     </p>
     <p>
      The surety company within sixty days after executing such surety shall send written notice of the same to the commissioner, which notice must give the names and addresses of the parties contracting with respect to the real property and the place where the contract is to be performed. After the completion of the contract and the acceptance of the improvement by the owner of the real property improved, the surety company shall give written notice of such completion and acceptance to the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      Six months after the completion of the contract and the acceptance of the improvement by the owner thereof, the additional obligation imposed upon the surety company ceases unless written notice, within such period of time, of unpaid use taxes, is given to the surety company by the commissioner.

      This section does not modify or repeal any provision of chapter 48-01.2.

If a motor vehicle or other tangible personal property that will be subject to a sales or use tax imposed by chapter 57-39.2 or 57-40.2 when sold or used is taken in trade as a credit or as part payment on a motor vehicle taxable under this chapter, the credit or trade-in value allowed by the person selling the motor vehicle shall be deducted from the total selling price to establish the purchase price of the vehicle being sold and the trade-in allowance allowed by the seller on a motor vehicle accepted as a trade-in shall constitute the purchase price of a motor vehicle accepted as a trade-in. If a motor vehicle is purchased by an owner who has had a motor vehicle stolen or totally destroyed, a credit or trade-in credit shall be allowed against one or more replacement motor vehicle purchases in a cumulative amount not to exceed the total amount the purchaser has been compensated by an insurance company for the loss plus the amount of the purchaser’s deductible at the time of the loss. For a leased vehicle that is stolen or totally destroyed, the credit may not exceed the total amount of motor vehicle excise tax paid. The purchaser must provide the director of the department of transportation with a notarized statement from the insurance company within three years from the date of issuance verifying the fact that the original vehicle was a total loss and stating the amount compensated by the insurance company for the loss and the amount of the purchaser’s deductible at the time of the loss. The statement from the insurance company must accompany the purchaser’s application for a certificate of title for the replacement vehicle. If the full amount of the credit under this subsection has not been used, the director of the department of transportation shall record on the face of the notarized statement the necessary information to identify the partial use of the credit and shall retain a copy and return the original to the purchaser. In instances in which a licensed motor vehicle dealer places into the dealer’s service a new vehicle for the purpose of renting, leasing, or dealership utility service, the reasonable value of the vehicle replaced shall be included as trade-in value provided the vehicle replaced has been subject to motor vehicle excise tax under section 57-40.3-02 and if the new vehicle is properly registered and licensed. “Purchase price” when the motor vehicle is acquired by gift or by any other transfer for a nominal or no monetary consideration also includes the average value of similar motor vehicles, established by standards and guides as determined by the director of the department of transportation. “Purchase price” when a motor vehicle is manufactured by a person who registers it under the laws of this state means the manufactured cost of such motor vehicle and manufactured cost means the amount expended for materials, labor, and other properly allocable costs of manufacture except that, in the absence of actual expenditures for the manufacture of a part or all of the motor vehicle, manufactured cost means the reasonable value of the completed motor vehicle.

       Whenever any taxpayer liable to pay a tax or penalty imposed refuses or neglects to pay it, the amount, including any interest, penalty, or addition to such tax, together with the costs that may accrue, is a lien in favor of the state upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to the taxpayer. In the case of property in which a deceased taxpayer held an interest as joint tenant or otherwise with right of survivorship at the time of death, the lien continues as a lien against the property of the survivor or survivors to the extent of the deceased taxpayer’s interest therein, which interest must be determined by dividing the value of the entire property at the time of the taxpayer’s death by the number of joint tenants or persons interested therein. The lien attaches at the time the tax becomes due and payable and continues until the liability for such amount is satisfied.

     <p>
      If any sales tax, use tax, or motor vehicle excise tax has been paid on a motor vehicle in any other state, or political subdivision thereof, in respect to its sale or use in an amount less than the tax imposed by this chapter, the provisions of this chapter apply, but in an amount equal to the difference between the tax imposed by this chapter and the tax paid in the other state, or political subdivision thereof. If the tax paid in the other state, or political subdivision thereof, is the same or more, then no tax is due on the motor vehicle. The provisions of this section apply only if the other state, or political subdivision thereof, allows a tax credit with respect to the excise tax imposed by this chapter which is substantially similar in effect to the credit allowed by this section. The tax commissioner may require the purchaser to provide written proof from the other state, or political subdivision thereof, that the tax was legally due and paid. For purposes of this section, “state” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this chapter, have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except when the context clearly indicates a different meaning:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-40.5s57-40.5-01ol11">
       “Aircraft” includes airplanes, helicopters, manned balloons, and ultralight vehicles.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.5s57-40.5-01ol12">
       “Director” means the director of aeronautics.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.5s57-40.5-01ol13">
       “Purchase price” means the total amount paid for the aircraft whether paid in money or otherwise, provided, however, that when an aircraft or a motor vehicle that will be subject to the motor vehicle excise tax imposed by chapter 57-40.3, is taken in trade on an aircraft taxable under this chapter, the trade-in value allowed by the person selling the aircraft must be deducted from the selling price to establish the purchase price of the aircraft being sold and the trade-in allowance allowed by the seller on an aircraft accepted as a trade-in constitutes the purchase price of an aircraft. “Purchase price” also means the fair market value when no current purchase is involved and the aircraft is moved by the owner or user from any other state into this state and on which no sales, use, or excise tax was paid by the owner or user to any other state, or on which a sales, use, or excise tax was paid by the owner or user to another state which does not have reciprocity with this state, and for which aircraft registration is required by section 2-05-11 or registration and licensing required is by section 2-05-18. If an aircraft is purchased by a person who has paid the excise tax and who has had an aircraft stolen or destroyed, a credit must be allowed in the amount the purchaser has paid in tax on the stolen or destroyed aircraft. The purchaser must provide the director with a notarized statement from the insurance company verifying the fact that the original aircraft was a total loss and stating the amount compensated by the insurance company for the loss. The statement from the insurance company must accompany the purchaser’s application for a certificate of registration for the replacement aircraft. In instances in which a licensed aircraft dealer or established fixed-base aviation operator located at an airport open for public use and approved by the aeronautics commission, places into service a new or used aircraft for the purpose of renting, leasing, or dealership or fixed-base aviation operator utility service, the reasonable value of the new or used replacement aircraft must be included as a trade-in value if the new or replacement aircraft is properly registered with the aeronautics commission. “Purchase price” when the aircraft is acquired by gift or other transfer for a nominal or no monetary consideration also includes the average value of similar aircraft, established by standards as determined by the director. “Purchase price” when an aircraft is manufactured by a person who registered it under the laws of this state means the manufactured cost of such aircraft and manufactured cost means the amount expended for materials, labor, and other properly allocable costs of manufacture except that, in the absence of actual expenditures for the manufacture of a part or all of the aircraft, manufactured cost means the reasonable value of the completed aircraft, as determined by the director.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.5s57-40.5-01ol14">
       “Purchaser” means any person owning or in possession of an aircraft who makes application to the director for registration of such aircraft.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.5s57-40.5-01ol15">
       “Sale”, “sells”, “selling”, “purchase”, or “acquired” includes any transfer of title or ownership of an aircraft by way of gift, exchange, barter, or by any other manner for or without consideration.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.5s57-40.5-01ol16">
       “Use” means the exercise by any person of any right incident to ownership of an aircraft, except that it does not include the sale or holding for sale of such an aircraft in the regular course of business.

      If any aircraft has been subjected to a sales tax, use tax, or excise tax in any other state, in an amount less than the tax imposed by this chapter, the provisions of this chapter apply at a rate measured by the difference between the rate fixed in this chapter and the rate by which the previous tax paid in the other state upon the sale or use was computed. If the tax imposed in another state equals or exceeds the tax imposed by this chapter, then no tax is due on such aircraft. The provisions of this section apply only if such other state allows a credit with respect to the excise tax imposed by this chapter which is substantially similar in effect to the credit allowed by this section.

No refund may be authorized by the commissioner until the commissioner is fully satisfied through the production of necessary purchase agreements, tax receipts, and other documents and information that the refund is warranted. Payment of the refund must be made by warrant after approval by the office of management and budget and approval of the voucher by the office of the budget.

    Authority of counties or cities to impose fee on assessed communications service — Procedure.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of a county or city may impose a fee on all assessed communications services in accordance with the following requirements:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-40.6s57-40.6-02ol11">
       The governing body shall adopt a resolution that proposes the adoption of the fee permitted under this section. The resolution must specify an effective date for the fee which is no more than two years before the expected implementation date of the emergency services communication system to be funded by the fee. The resolution must include a provision for submitting the proposed fee to the electors of the county or city before the imposition of the fee is effective. The resolution must specify a fee that does not exceed one dollar and fifty cents per month per communication connection and must be applied equally upon all assessed communications services. Prepaid wireless service is not subject to the fee imposed under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.6s57-40.6-02ol12">
       A political subdivision shall add a fee of fifty cents to the fee imposed on assessed communications services established under subsection 1. The additional fifty cents per communication connection must be remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in the statewide interoperable radio network fund in accordance with section 37 17.3 12 for implementing a statewide interoperable radio network. The funds collected under this subsection must be expended in a manner consistent with the recommendations of the statewide interoperability executive committee.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.6s57-40.6-02ol13">
       The question of the adoption of the fee must be submitted on a petition on which the petition title of the proposition includes the maximum monthly rate of the proposed fee authorized under subsection 1. The question of the adoption of the fee may be submitted to electors at a general, primary, or special election or at a school district election if the boundaries of the school district are coterminous with the boundaries of the governing body adopting the resolution proposing the adoption of the fee. The fee is not effective unless it is approved by a majority of the electors voting on the proposition. The ballot must be worded so that a “yes” vote authorizes imposition of the fee.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.6s57-40.6-02ol14">
       Once established by this section, the maximum fee may be increased, decreased, or eliminated by a majority vote of the electors. The question may be placed on the ballot of any general, primary, or special election by a resolution of the governing body, or by a petition signed by ten percent or more of the total number of qualified electors of the political subdivision voting for governor at the most recent gubernatorial election and submitted to the governing body. By action of the governing body, the fee amount collected may be adjusted, subject to the maximum approved by the voters, to meet the costs allowed by this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.6s57-40.6-02ol15">
       In any geographic area, only one political subdivision may impose the fee and imposition must be based on the subscriber service address.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-40.6s57-40.6-02ol16">
       In the interest of public safety, where the subscriber’s telephone exchange access service boundary and the boundary of the political subdivision imposing the fee do not coincide, and where all of the political subdivisions within the subscriber’s telephone exchange access service boundary have not complied with subsection 1, and where a majority of the subscribers within the subscriber’s telephone exchange access service boundary have voted for the fee, a telephone exchange access service subscriber whose subscriber service address is outside the political subdivision may receive 911 services by signing a contract agreement with the political subdivision providing the emergency services communication system. The telephone exchange access service provider may collect an additional fee, equal in amount to the basic fee on those subscribers within the exchange boundary.

      A refund claim must be on a form furnished by the commissioner and must have a written declaration by the claimant that it is made under the penalties of perjury. The tax commissioner may prescribe alternative methods for signing, subscribing, or verifying a return filed by electronic means, including telecommunications, that shall have the same validity and consequence as the actual signature and written declaration for a paper return. The refund claim must indicate that the motor vehicle fuel was used or is to be used by the claimant other than in a licensed motor vehicle, the purpose or type of project for which the motor vehicle fuel was used, and such other information as the commissioner requires. The original invoices or sales tickets proving the purchase of motor vehicle fuel on which the refund is claimed must be attached to the refund claim. The invoices or sales tickets must include the seller’s name and address, the date the fuel was purchased, the type of product, the number of gallons [liters] of motor vehicle fuel purchased, and the name of the claimant. If the original invoices or sales tickets are lost, the claimant may substitute duplicate invoices or sales tickets plus a separate affidavit on forms prescribed by the commissioner. A certified history of purchases detailing required information may be accepted by the commissioner in lieu of original sales invoices or sales tickets. A supplier, distributor, or retailer is prohibited from preparing a refund claim for the consumer.

If additional tax is found due or if an additional tax refund applies, the commissioner shall notify the claimant in detail of the reason for the increase or decrease. For any claim selected for audit, the claimant shall provide additional verification as required by the commissioner of fuel purchases, payment of the tax, use of the fuel for a purpose entitling the claimant to a refund, and use of the fuel other than in a licensed motor vehicle.

The dissolution of a limited liability limited partnership does not discharge a general partner’s liability for a prior failure of the partnership to file a return or remit the tax due.

The cash deposit, bond, or undertaking must be in an amount equal to the estimated motor fuel tax liability of the limited liability limited partnership.

       The commissioner, or an authorized representative, may audit the records, books, and papers and examine fuel and any equipment used to store, transport, or dispense fuel, of a refiner, supplier, distributor, importer, exporter, terminal operator, retailer, or common or contract carrier. For a person required to file a report, the examination and audit must be done no later than three years after the due date of the report or three years after the report was filed, whichever period expires later. The commissioner is authorized to make assessments of tax, plus penalty and interest, or to issue credits or refunds as determined on the basis of the examination and audit.

       If it is determined upon audit that the tax due was twenty-five percent or more above the amount reported on a report, the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of the tax may be begun without such assessment, at any time within six years after the due date of the return, or six years after the return was filed, whichever period expires later.

       Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the commissioner may audit any consumer’s claim for refund and, not later than three years after the due date of a claim or three years after the claim was filed, whichever period expires later, assess additional tax or issue an additional refund. If additional tax is found due or if an additional tax refund applies, the commissioner shall notify the claimant in detail of the reason for the increase or decrease. For any claim selected for audit, the claimant shall provide additional verification as required by the commissioner of fuel purchases, payment of the tax, use of the fuel for a purpose entitling the claimant to a refund, and use of the fuel other than in a licensed motor vehicle.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-43.2s57-43.2-14ol14">
       If a person gives false or fraudulent information in a report or in a claim for refund, or if the failure by a person to file a tax report is due to the fraudulent intent or the willful attempt of the person in any manner to evade the tax, the time limitations in this section do not apply, and the tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in court for the collection of the tax may be begun without the assessment, at any time.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-43.2s57-43.2-14ol15">
       If before the expiration of the time prescribed in this chapter for the assessment of tax, the commissioner and the person consent in writing to an extension of time for the assessment of the tax, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.

     <p>
      If a person fails, neglects, or refuses to file a special fuel tax report when due, the commissioner shall, on the basis of available information, determine the tax liability for the period during which no report was filed, and to the tax thus determined the commissioner shall add the penalty and interest as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-43.2s57-43.2-15" target="_self">57-43.2-15.</a></cite> An assessment made by the commissioner under this section or section 57-43.2-14 is presumed to be correct, and in any case when the validity of the assessment is in question, the burden is on the person who challenges the assessment to establish by fair preponderance of evidence that it is erroneous or excessive.

        District court did not err in dismissing taxpayer’s claims against a county and county officials because the taxpayers did not first submit their property tax claims to the county board of commissioners; if the taxpayers believed the county erred by not accepting and honoring their promissory notes as payment for property taxes, their remedy was to seek redress with the board of commissioners.

      Whenever any action is brought to test the validity of any deed issued and delivered by the county to the purchaser of lands acquired through tax deed proceedings, the court may not proceed with the trial of such action until the party assailing the validity of such deed, within the time required by the court, shall deposit with the clerk thereof for the benefit of the county, should the deed be held invalid, the amount of all delinquent and unpaid taxes on said property, including penalty and interest, plus any taxes paid thereon by the purchaser from the county. Should said action be determined adversely to the purchaser from the county, it shall repay to the purchaser any moneys received by the county on said purchase.

        The deposit demanded by this section is primarily for the benefit of the county because that statute requires the county to repay the purchaser in the event the tax title fails. The deposit condition is intended to prevent a party, who successfully invalidates a tax title, from escaping payment of the taxes on the property. Fibelstad v. Grant County, 474 N.W.2d 54, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Where the validity of a sale of tax-acquired land by the county is raised in an action to quiet title, order of court requiring former owners of the property to deposit amount of taxes due erroneously directed payment of the deposit to the purchaser. Remmich v. Wagner, 77 N.D. 120, 41 N.W.2d 170, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1950).

       <p>
        Where, in an action to quiet title to which the county is made a party, the validity of a tax deed executed by the county is challenged and the deed is held to be invalid, the county is entitled as a matter of law to a judgment upon proof made for the amount of delinquent and unpaid taxes on said property, including penalties and interest, plus any taxes paid thereon by the purchaser from the county, to be paid out of the deposit made pursuant to this section. Belakjon v. Hilstad, 78 N.D. 194, 48 N.W.2d 747, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D. 1951).

       <p>
        Where plaintiffs bring an action to quiet title in which action the county is made a party defendant and the validity of a tax deed executed by the county is challenged and held void, the plaintiffs are required by this section to make a deposit in the amount of all delinquent and unpaid taxes on said property, including penalty and interest, plus taxes paid thereon by the purchaser from the county as determined by the trial court; and a formal demand by the county for judgment in such amount is not necessary. Strom v. Giske, 68 N.W.2d 838, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite>, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1954).

        Failure of court to require former owner of land, suing for cancellation of tax deed to county and deed by which county conveyed the land to the purchaser, to deposit amount equal to price paid county by purchaser and costs was not prejudicial to the county, where money was held by county officers pending outcome of case and the amount tendered by the former owner covered taxes, penalty, interest, and costs of sale.

     <p>
      Any person having or claiming title to or a lien or encumbrance upon any land, whether in that person’s possession or the possession of another, or vacant or unoccupied, may commence and maintain an action against any person, county, or state claiming any title to or interest in the land, or a lien upon the land, adversely to the person by or through any tax deed, to test the validity of the tax deed, or to quiet the title to the land as against the claims of the adverse claimant, or to remove the cloud from the title arising from the tax deed. An action or defense based upon the invalidity of a tax deed may not be commenced or interposed after three years from the issuance of a tax deed unless the tax deed is void by reason of jurisdictional defects. The holder of a tax deed may maintain an action to establish the validity of the tax deed or to quiet title to the land and may demand the possession of the land.

    Procedure when taxes or tax lien foreclosures are declared invalid.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When any foreclosure of land for taxes is adjudged to be void, the judgment must state the reason why it is void. In all such cases, and in cases when by the mistake or wrongful act of the county treasurer or auditor, land has been foreclosed upon which no taxes were due, and in cases when taxes have been or may be paid on lands not subject to taxation, or on lands when subsequent to payment the entry has been or may be canceled, the money so paid and all subsequent taxes, penalties, and costs which have been or which may be paid must be refunded, with interest at seven percent per annum from the date of payment to the person making such payment, the person’s heirs or assigns, and the same must be refunded out of the county treasury to which such money was paid, on an order from the county auditor. A pro rata share of the money so refunded must be charged to the state and to any city, township, school district, or other taxing district which may have received any part of such void tax. Whenever any tax deed made and delivered under this title is adjudged to be void, unless the judgment declares the tax to be illegal, the tax and all subsequent taxes shall remain and be a lien upon the land, and the county auditor shall serve notice of foreclosure of tax lien on the following October first pursuant to chapter 57-28 for the full amount of taxes, penalties, and costs due thereon.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When any tax required by law to be paid to the state has been assessed, certified, and demanded and is delinquent and remains unpaid, the officer of the state charged with the enforcement of the payment or collection of the same, within ten days after such demand, shall notify the delinquent that unless the tax is paid on or before the tenth day thereafter, it will be placed in the hands of any sheriff for collection. If the tax remains unpaid, such official, upon such date, shall certify the tax to the sheriff of any county wherein the property of the delinquent taxpayer may be located. The sheriff immediately shall proceed to collect the delinquent tax, and if it is not paid forthwith upon demand, the sheriff shall distrain sufficient property belonging to the taxpayer to pay it, including the penalty provided by law, with accrued interest at the rate of six percent per annum, and all costs of such distraint and sale. The sheriff immediately shall proceed to advertise the sale of such property by putting notices in three public places in the municipality or district where the property is taken, stating the time when and the place where the property is to be sold, the amount of the delinquent tax, penalties, accrued interest, and cost. The place of sale must be at the residence or place of business of the person whose property has been distrained, or at the place of sale of mortgaged chattels or real property within such town or district, at the discretion of the sheriff. The sale may not be less than ten days after the taking of the property, and if such tax, penalties, accrued interest, and costs are not paid at that time, the sheriff or the sheriff’s deputy shall proceed to sell the property at public auction, or so much thereof as is sufficient to pay the taxes, penalties, accrued interest, and costs. Any surplus arising from the sale must be disposed of as in the case of mortgaged personal or real property, as the case may be. All moneys collected under the provisions of this chapter must be paid into the state treasury, and the state treasurer shall issue to such sheriff a proper receipt for the same.

      Whenever in the judgment of the board of county commissioners all taxes authorized to be levied in any one year for general or special county purposes are insufficient to carry on the primary governmental functions, or to pay the mandatory obligations imposed by law upon a county, then such a county may borrow money in an amount the board determines necessary to meet the deficiencies existing in its general or special funds, or to carry on primary governmental functions, and to pay mandatory obligations. For the purpose of borrowing, a county may issue evidences of indebtedness, which must consist of an agreement by the county to pay a stated sum on a specified date, or on or before a specified date, not more than five years in the future, or twenty years for loans issued under section 6-09-49
   or <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.06.html#t06c6-09s6-09-49" target="_blank">6-09-49.</a></cite>1, together with interest at a rate or rates resulting in an average annual net interest cost not to exceed twelve percent per annum if sold privately, or with no interest rate ceiling if sold at a public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. A public sale must comply with the procedures set out in chapter 21-03.

       <p>
        Federal land bank’s royalty interest in produced oil and gas was exempt, pursuant to the state constitution, from the tax imposed by this chapter, and state failed in its burden to prove that such tax was upon real estate, which if proven, would have constituted congressional waiver, pursuant to 12 USCS 2055, of the tax exemption. Federal Land Bank v. State, 274 N.W.2d 580, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1979).

       <p>
        District court properly determined that, as a matter of law, the State's settlement agreement with plaintiff did not exempt plaintiff from paying gross production and extraction taxes on his royalty interest. The settlement agreement could only reasonably be interpreted as addressing the 50 percent reservation of the mineral interest, not tax exemptions. Burk v. State, 2017 ND 25, 890 N.W.2d 535, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        The tax commissioner properly interpreted this section and N.D.C.C. § 57-51.1-02 as allowing him to use downstream metered measurements of oil volume and, if those measurements disclosed a larger volume of oil than oil company had reported and paid taxes on (using a hand-gauging measurement method at the well), to tax that volume gain, with the value of that volume gain oil at the well being determined by averaging, on a monthly basis, the prices company paid to its producers during the period 1980 through 1983.

      On all oil reclaimed from tank bottoms, pit oil, and saltwater, the gross production tax shall be paid by the operator of the reclaiming plant, unless taxes have already been paid thereon.

If the operator has not paid a cash price for the material, the oil reclaimed has no value at the well. Every person, firm, association, corporation, or limited liability company engaged in the sale, purchasing, and refining of tank bottoms, pit oil, and saltwater shall report to the commissioner, upon forms prescribed by the commissioner, information necessary to the enforcement of this section.

The commissioner may waive the requirement that a producer file a well production report. A waiver by the commissioner of the requirement to file a well production report does not release the producer from any obligation to remit the tax under this chapter.

The penalties herein prescribed are for failure to file reports and are in addition to the penalty imposed by section 57-51-10 and likewise constitute a lien against the assets of the person failing or refusing to file the reports. The penalties prescribed under this section must be collected in the same manner as gross production taxes and must be apportioned as other gross production tax penalties; provided, that the commissioner may, for good cause shown, waive any penalties imposed under this section. When royalty is claimed to be exempt from taxation by law, the facts on which the claims of exemption are based and other relevant information must be furnished when requested by the commissioner.

     <p>
      In all cases of overpayment, duplicate payment, or payment made in error, the commissioner may issue a certificate stating therein the facts and the amount of the refund to which the taxpayer may be entitled. Upon presentation of the certificate to the office of management and budget, a warrant shall be issued to the taxpayer for the purpose of refunding any overpayment, duplicate payment, or payment made in error out of the unapportioned gross production tax in the state treasury and a pro rata share thereof must be charged against the county entitled to share in the tax. Interest arising from refunds of overpayments, duplicate payments, and erroneous payments must be allowed and paid at the rate of ten percent per annum and accrues for payment from sixty days after the due date of the return or after the return was filed or after the tax was fully paid, whichever comes later.
     </p>
     <p>
      A taxpayer may file a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax within three years of the due date of the return or three years after the return was filed. However, if there is a change in tax liability on any return by an amount in excess of twenty-five percent of the amount of tax liability reported on a return, a claim for refund of tax may be filed within six years after the due date of the return or six years after the return was filed, whichever period expires last.

The commissioner may require a sufficient bond from any person charged with the making and filing of reports and the payment of the taxes imposed under this chapter. The bond must run to the state of North Dakota and must be conditioned upon the making and filing of reports as required by law, upon compliance with the rules and regulations of the commissioner, and for the prompt payment, by the principal therein, of all taxes justly due the state under this chapter. When any reports required have not been filed, or may be insufficient to furnish all the information required by the commissioner, the commissioner shall institute, in the name of the state of North Dakota upon relation of the commissioner, any necessary action or proceedings in the courts having jurisdiction, to enjoin such person from continuing operations until such reports have been filed as required, and in all proper cases, injunction must issue without bond from the state of North Dakota. Upon showing that the state is in danger of losing its claims or the property is being mismanaged, dissipated, or concealed, a receiver must be appointed at the suit of the state.

    Imposition of oil extraction tax.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby imposed an excise tax, to be known as the “oil extraction tax”, upon the activity in this state of extracting oil from the earth, and every owner, including any royalty owner, of any part of the oil extracted is deemed for the purposes of this chapter to be engaged in the activity of extracting that oil.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of tax is five percent of the gross value at the well of the oil extracted.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, if the average price of a barrel of crude oil exceeds the trigger price of ninety dollars for each month in any consecutive three-month period, then the rate of tax on oil extracted from all taxable wells is six percent of the gross value at the well of the oil extracted until the average price of a barrel of crude oil is less than the trigger price of ninety dollars for each month in any consecutive three-month period, in which case the rate of tax reverts to five percent of the gross value at the well of the oil extracted. By December thirty-first of each year, the tax commissioner shall determine an indexed trigger price under this section by applying to the current trigger price an adjustment equal to the percentage rate of change of the producer price index for industrial commodities as calculated and published by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, for the twelve months ending June thirtieth of that year and the indexed trigger price so determined is the trigger price for the following calendar year.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purposes of this section, “average price” of a barrel of crude oil means the monthly average of the daily closing price for a barrel of west Texas intermediate cushing crude oil, as those prices appear in the Wall Street Journal, midwest edition. When computing the monthly average price, the most recent previous daily closing price must be considered the daily closing price for the days on which the market is closed.

    County and township infrastructure fund — Continuing appropriation — State treasurer — Reports.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      There is created in the state treasury the county and township infrastructure fund. The fund consists of all moneys deposited in the fund under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-51.1s57-51.1-07" target="_self">57-51.1-07.</a></cite>5. All moneys in the fund are appropriated to the state treasurer on a continuing basis for the purpose of providing grants to non-oil-producing counties and townships located in non-oil-producing counties. The grant funding may be distributed only to non-oil-producing counties and townships located in non-oil-producing counties and may be used only for road and bridge infrastructure projects.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-51.1s57-51.1-07.11ol11">
       By November thirtieth of each even-numbered year, starting in 2022, a county that receives a grant from the fund shall provide a report to the state treasurer on the use of the funding. The state treasurer shall notify counties of the reporting requirement by November first of each even-numbered year, starting in 2022. Upon request, the state treasurer may provide an extension of up to fifteen days for a county to submit the report. The state treasurer shall determine the format of the report. The report must include the amount of grant funding received and spent by the county and a description of the road and bridge infrastructure projects completed in part or in whole with the grant funding. The state treasurer shall make the reports available to the public on the state treasurer’s website. A county that does not provide the report in a timely manner or in the correct format is not eligible to receive a grant from the fund for a period of two years starting from the date the report was due. If a county uses the funding in a manner inconsistent with the requirements of this section as identified in any financial audits conducted by the state auditor or an independent accounting firm, the state treasurer shall reduce any future grants to that county by the amount spent that was inconsistent with the requirements.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-51.1s57-51.1-07.11ol12">
       Within sixty days after the fund receives its statutory limit of oil and gas tax allocations under section 57-51.1-07.5 or by September thirtieth of each odd-numbered year, whichever is earlier, the state treasurer shall distribute moneys in the fund as grants to counties for road and bridge infrastructure projects. The state treasurer shall distribute the grants only if the fund balance is at least ten percent of the amount needed for distributions under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-51.1s57-51.1-07.11ol13">
       The state treasurer shall distribute the lesser of thirteen percent of the balance of the fund or sixteen million one hundred thousand dollars to non-oil-producing counties for the benefit of the organized and unorganized townships within each non-oil-producing county. The distribution to each non-oil-producing county must provide for an equal allocation to each organized and unorganized township. The amount allocated to organized townships under this section must be paid by the county treasurer to each organized township. The amount allocated to unorganized townships under this section must be credited by the county treasurer to a special fund for unorganized township roads. A township is not eligible for an allocation of funds under this section if the township does not maintain any township roads.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-51.1s57-51.1-07.11ol14">
       After the distributions in subsection 3, the state treasurer shall distribute the remaining money in the fund to non-oil-producing counties based on the most recent data compiled by the upper great plains transportation institute regarding North Dakota’s county, township, and tribal road and bridge infrastructure needs. The distribution to each non-oil-producing county must be proportional to each non-oil-producing county’s total estimated road and bridge investment needs relative to the combined total estimated road and bridge investment needs of all the non-oil-producing counties. The total estimated road and bridge investment needs for each county is the twenty-year estimate for unpaved and paved road and bridge needs as identified by the upper great plains transportation institute. If the data compiled by the upper great plains transportation institute includes more than one twenty-year estimate for the total needs of each county, the state treasurer shall use an average of the twenty-year estimates for each county.

      The director of tax equalization shall determine the tax for each mobile home by placing an evaluation on the mobile home based upon its assessed value and by adjusting the valuation of the mobile home by the percentage provided in section 57-02-27 to determine its taxable valuation under standards and guides determined by the state tax commissioner and applying that evaluation to the preceding year’s total mill levies applying to property within the taxing district in which the mobile home is located. The county treasurer shall provide a tax statement for each mobile home subject to taxation under this chapter, including three columns showing, for the taxable year to which the tax statement applies and the two immediately preceding taxable years, the property tax levy in dollars against the mobile home by the county and school district and any city or township that levied taxes against the mobile home. If a mobile home is acquired or moved into this state during the calendar year and a tax permit has not been previously issued for such mobile home in this state for such year, the tax is determined by computing the remaining number of months of the current year to the nearest full month and multiplying that number by one-twelfth of the amount which would be due for the full year. The taxes collected under this chapter must be disbursed in the same year they are collected and in the same manner as real estate taxes for the preceding year are disbursed.

      Any person having any estate, right, title, or interest in or lien upon any mobile home which has been assessed for taxation purposes pursuant to this chapter may apply for abatement, refund, or compromise, as the case may be, pursuant to chapter 57-23.

The county auditor shall promptly serve the county director of tax equalization with one copy of the application. The abatement or compromise must be granted by the county commissioners if the facts upon which the application is based establish that the assessment contains error, or that the value placed upon the mobile home by the county director of tax equalization was excessive, or that the mobile home is exempt from taxation pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-55s57-55-10" target="_self">57-55-10.</a></cite> The decision of the county commissioners may be appealed in the manner provided by law.

      The owner shall pay to the county treasurer, at the time taxes on other real property are due, a forest stewardship tax computed at a rate of fifty cents per acre. The tax is a part of the total real property taxes on the land of the owner and subject to collection in the same manner as any other real property taxes. The payment of taxes under this chapter is in lieu of all ad valorem taxes by the state, counties, towns, townships, school districts, and other municipalities upon any property rights attached to the forest.

      The state forester shall make an annual written report as to the forest practices of each forest owner or the agent of the owner covering lands enrolled under this chapter.

The report must list the landowners, legal descriptions, and acreages which are eligible to receive continued tax benefits.

     <p>
      There is hereby imposed upon the operator of each coal conversion facility a tax paid monthly for the privilege of producing products of such coal conversion facility. The rate of the tax must be computed as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-60s57-60-02ol11">
       For all coal conversion facilities, except as otherwise provided in this section, the tax is measured by the gross receipts derived from the facility for the preceding month and is in the amount of two percent of its gross receipts. Gross receipts derived from the sale of a capital asset are not subject to the tax imposed by this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-60s57-60-02ol12">
       For electrical generating plants, the tax is at a rate of sixty-five one-hundredths of one mill times sixty percent of the installed capacity of each unit times the number of hours in the taxable period. All electrical energy generating units that begin construction or complete repowering are exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the unit. If a unit is incapable of generating electricity for eighteen consecutive months, the tax on that unit for taxable periods beginning after the eighteenth month must be reduced by the ratio that the cost of repair of the unit bears to the original cost of the unit. This reduced rate remains in effect until the unit is capable of generating electricity.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-60s57-60-02ol13">
       For electrical generating plants, in addition to the tax imposed by subsection 2, there is a tax at the rate of twenty-five one-hundredths of one mill on each kilowatt hour of electricity produced for the purpose of sale. For all electrical generating plants that begin construction or complete repowering, the production from the plants is exempt from the tax imposed by this subsection for five years from the date of the first taxable production or from the date of the first taxable production after repowering from the plant.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-60s57-60-02ol14">
       For coal gasification plants, the tax is the greater of either the amount provided in subsection 1 or thirteen and one-half cents on each one thousand cubic feet [28316.85 liters] of synthetic natural gas produced for the purpose of sale but not including any amount of synthetic natural gas in excess of one hundred ten million cubic feet per day.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-60s57-60-02ol15">
       For all coal conversion facilities, other than electrical generating plants, the production from the facilities is exempt from eighty-five percent of the tax imposed by this section for a period of five years from the date of first taxable production from the facility. The operator of each facility applying for exemption under this subsection shall certify to the tax commissioner the date of first taxable production of the facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-60s57-60-02ol16">
       For coal beneficiation plants, the tax is twenty cents on each ton of two thousand pounds [907.18 kilograms] of beneficiated coal produced for the purpose of sale, or one and one-quarter percent of the gross receipts derived from such facility for the preceding month, whichever amount is greater. Any amount of beneficiated coal produced in excess of eighty percent of the design capacity of the coal beneficiation plant or produced for use within a coal conversion facility is exempt from such tax.

      <li id="t57c57-60s57-60-02ol17">
       With the exception of the tax imposed under subsection 3, the board of county commissioners, by resolution, may grant the operator of a plant or facility located within the county a partial or complete exemption from up to fifteen percent of the tax imposed under this section for a period not to extend past June 30, 2026. If a board of county commissioners grants a partial or complete exemption for a specific plant or facility under this subsection, subsection of section 57-60-14 does not apply. Notwithstanding section 57-60-14, any tax collected from a plant or facility subject to the exemption provided by this subsection must be allocated entirely to the county for allocation as provided in section 57-60-15.

      A coal conversion facility that achieves a twenty percent capture of carbon dioxide emissions during a taxable period is entitled to a twenty percent reduction in the state general fund share of the tax imposed under section 57-60-02 during that taxable period. The facility is entitled to an additional reduction of one percent of the state general fund share of the tax imposed under section 57-60-02 for every additional two percentage points of its capture of carbon dioxide emissions. A maximum fifty percent reduction of the state general fund share of the tax imposed under section 57-60-02 is allowed for eighty percent or more capture of carbon dioxide emissions. A coal conversion facility may receive the reduction in coal conversion tax under this section for ten years from the date of first capture of carbon dioxide emission or for ten years from the date the coal conversion facility is eligible to receive the credit. A coal conversion facility that met the carbon dioxide capture requirements before January 1, 2017, may not claim the reduction under this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of university and school lands is authorized to make loans to coal development-impacted counties, cities, and school districts before or after the beginning of actual coal mining from moneys deposited in the coal development trust fund established by subsection 2 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-62s57-62-02" target="_self">57-62-02.</a></cite> Loans made prior to actual mining must be preceded by site permitting and by beginning actual construction of the mine or its mine mouth facility. Loans may be made for any purpose for which a grant may be made pursuant to this chapter, but before making any loan the board of university and school lands shall receive the recommendation of the energy infrastructure and impact office. The board of university and school lands shall prescribe the terms and conditions of such loans within the provisions of this chapter and shall require a warrant executed by the governing body of the county, city, or school district as evidence of such loan. The warrants must bear interest at a rate not to exceed six percent. The warrants shall be payable only from the allocations of moneys from the coal development fund to the borrowing county, city, or school district and shall not constitute a general obligation of the county, city, or school district nor may such loans be considered as indebtedness of the county, city, or school district. Loans made in advance of actual coal mining must provide that repayment is to begin when the borrowing county, city, or school district receives allocations from the coal development fund. The terms of the loan must provide that not less than ten percent of each allocation made to the borrowing county, city, or school district pursuant to this chapter must be withheld by the state treasurer to repay the principal of the warrants and the interest thereon. The amount withheld by the state treasurer as payment of interest must be deposited in the general fund and the amount withheld by the state treasurer as payment of principal must be remitted to the board of university and school lands and deposited by the board in the trust fund provided for in subsection 2 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-62s57-62-02" target="_self">57-62-02.</a></cite> The warrants executed by the county, city, or school district have all of the qualities and incidents of negotiable paper and are not subject to taxation by the state of North Dakota or by any political subdivision thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of university and school lands is authorized to sell such warrants to other parties and the proceeds of such sale which constitute principal must be deposited in the coal development trust fund and that which constitutes interest in the general fund. If the future allocations of moneys to the borrowing county, city, or school district should, for any reason, permanently cease, the loan shall be canceled except that if the county, city, or school district is merged with another county, city, or school district which receives an allocation of moneys from the coal development fund, the surviving county, city, or school district is obligated to repay the loan from such allocation. If the loan is canceled due to the permanent cessation of allocations of moneys to the county, city, or school district pursuant to this chapter, the board of university and school lands shall cancel those warrants it holds from such county, city, or school district and shall pay from any moneys in the trust fund provided for in subsection 2 of section 57-62-02 the principal and interest, as it becomes due, on those warrants of the county, city, or school district which are held by another party.

    Imposition of tax on potash.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A tax at the rate of two percent is imposed upon all potash produced within this state. The tax levied attaches to the whole production of potash except any byproducts of potash taxed under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t57c57-65s57-65-03" target="_self">57-65-03.</a></cite>
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t57c57-65s57-65-02ol11">
       The tax on potash is assessed against the sales price of the potash in an arm’s-length contract between the taxpayer and the purchaser. If a potash sale or transfer is not the result of an arm’s-length contract, the tax is calculated by taking a ton of two thousand pounds [907.18 kilograms] of potash produced times the potash tax rate times the annual average price of potash. The “annual average price of potash” for each twelve-month period beginning July first is the potash producer price index (commodity code PCU212391212391) as calculated and published by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, for the previous calendar year. For taxable production for the twelve months beginning July 1, 2011, the “annual average price of potash” is three hundred fifty-seven dollars and ten cents.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-65s57-65-02ol12">
       The tax department shall provide the annual average price of potash for the fiscal year to affected taxpayers by written notice mailed before June first.
      </li>
      <li id="t57c57-65s57-65-02ol13">
       If the potash producer price index is discontinued, a comparable index must be adopted by the department by an administrative rule.

     <p>
      A subsurface mineral tax of four percent is imposed upon the gross value of all subsurface mineral byproducts produced during the processing of potash produced within this state. The tax levied attaches to the whole production of byproducts. Inventory is not taxable until it is sold. The gross value at the processing plant is the price paid for the byproducts under an arm’s-length contract between the taxpayer and the purchaser. In the absence of an arm’s-length contract, the gross value at the processing plant is established by the price paid under an arm’s-length contract, to which the person paying the tax is a party, for the purchase or sale of byproducts of like kind, character, and quality.

      The payment of the taxes under this chapter must be in full and in lieu of all ad valorem taxes by the state, counties, cities, school districts, and other taxing districts upon any property rights attached to or inherent in the right to producing potash and potash byproducts; upon producing potash and potash byproducts leases; upon machinery, appliances, and equipment used in and around any well producing potash or potash byproducts and actually used in the operation of the well; and upon any investment in property.

       When any reports required have not been filed, or may be insufficient to furnish all the information required by the tax commissioner, the tax commissioner shall institute in the name of the state of North Dakota upon relation of the tax commissioner any necessary action or proceedings in the courts having jurisdiction to enjoin such person from continuing operations until such reports have been filed as required. In all proper cases an injunction must issue without bond from the state of North Dakota. Upon showing that the state is in danger of losing its claims or the property is being mismanaged, dissipated, or concealed, a receiver must be appointed.

      It is the intention of the legislative assembly that potash mining, environmental protection, and reclamation rules, at a minimum, must establish a high degree of protection for surface owners, surface and underground water, productive capacity of soils, and public health and safety and that the adopting agency will promote participation of public officials and members of the public in counties in which potash mining will be conducted.
