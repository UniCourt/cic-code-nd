     <p>
      The state fire marshal and the state fire marshal’s deputies have the power in any county in the state to summon and compel the attendance of witnesses to testify in relation to any matter which is being investigated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and to that end may administer an oath or affirmation to any person appearing as a witness before them. They may require the production of any pertinent books, papers, or documents, and a summons to appear before either of such officers must be served in the same manner and has the same effect as a subpoena in the district court. All witnesses shall receive the same compensation as is paid to witnesses in the district court, and such compensation must be paid out of the state fire marshal’s arson hearing and building condemnation hearing fund upon a voucher signed by the state fire marshal or the deputy state fire marshal before whom any witnesses shall have attended, and approved by the office of the budget. At the close of an investigation to which any witnesses were subpoenaed, the officer conducting the investigation shall certify the attendance and mileage of such witnesses, which certificate must be filed in the office of the state fire marshal.

      A firefighter who, for the number of years required for retirement, actually has served in a fire department in a municipality, rural fire department, or rural fire protection district in which a firefighters relief association has been organized and who pays into the firefighters relief and pension fund maintained in the municipality, rural fire department, or rural fire protection district assessments equal to the amounts assessed against the members of the association during the time of the firefighter’s service in the department, with interest upon the assessments, must be allowed membership in the association and is entitled to receive, upon retirement, the same pension from the fund as is paid to other firefighters. The bylaws of an association may not contain any provision that discriminates against a firefighter who actually has worked as a firefighter during the number of years required by the bylaws or which prevents the firefighter from, or discriminates against the firefighter in, participating in the association or in the benefits from the fund. The rights provided for in this chapter are acquired by compliance with this section whether compliance was accomplished before or after July 1, 1935, without regard to the time when the required service was performed.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The books and accounts of the secretary and treasurer of each firefighters relief association receiving funds under the provisions of this chapter must be audited as required by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.54.html#t54c54-10s54-10-14" target="_blank">54-10-14.</a></cite> If the money, or any part of it, has been or is being expended for unauthorized purposes, the facts must be reported to the governor. Thereupon, the governor shall direct the office of management and budget not to prepare any warrants for the benefits of the fire department or relief association of the municipality, rural fire department, or rural fire protection district in which the association is organized until it appears to the state auditor, who shall report the fact to the governor, that all moneys wrongfully expended have been replaced. The governor may take such further action as the emergency may demand.

      A voter-approved levy under this section authorized by electors of a township before January 1, 2015, remains in effect under the provisions of this section at the time the levy was authorized but not exceeding ten taxable years. Upon expiration of any mill levy under this section authorized by electors of a township before January 1, 2015, the governing body of the township or county may, by resolution, transfer any unobligated balance in the fund in which the levy proceeds were deposited to the general fund of the township.

      The board of county commissioners, from time to time, if a levy is made for a firebreak fund, shall divide the county into as many fire districts as may be necessary. Each district must be known and designated as “Fire District No.
   _________ ”. The board may map out each fire district in any form, consistent with the amount of funds available, so that when firebreaks are made a prairie fire will be confined to the smallest possible area. When forming fire districts, the board may take advantage of any creek, river, broken or plowed field, or other natural or artificial barrier to prairie fires.

        A landowner is not responsible for damage caused by prairie fire unless there is competent evidence connecting him with the persons who set the fire and negligently permitted it to spread. Forzen v. Hurd, 20 N.D. 42, 126 N.W. 224, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1910).

        Setting fire to prairie land contrary to the provisions of law renders the one who does so absolutely liable for injuries to others. Seckerson v.

        This section and N.D.C.C. § 18-08-07 do not render a landowner liable for a fire set upon his premises by another, unless the person who set the fire was acting under the direction of the landowner, or was in his employ and acting within the course of his employment in setting such fire.

      In addition to the penalties provided in section 18-09-03, any person, firm, or corporation who violates or remains in violation of any of the provisions hereof, or of any rule or regulation promulgated by the state fire marshal hereunder, may be directed and ordered by the state fire marshal or by the fire chief of any city or township, by notice in writing setting forth the facts relating to such violation to correct said violation. Such notice in writing must be served personally upon said person or mailed by registered or certified mail to the principal office of said person, firm, or corporation or if an individual, to the individual’s residence. If such order is not complied with and such violation not corrected within twenty days of the date of service of said order the state fire marshal or fire chief of any city or township shall file, in the district court of the county where such person or corporation may reside or have the person’s or corporation’s principal place of business or residence or where such violation occurs, a petition or complaint setting forth the facts relating to the making and serving of such order and praying for an injunction or an abatement, and the court upon notice and proper hearing shall make such determination thereof as seems necessary and proper to correct the violation and secure enforcement of said abatement order. Every order issued by the officials hereinbefore mentioned under the provisions of this section is prima facie evidence of the truth of the matters and things therein set forth. The court may issue such temporary orders pending full hearing as may seem necessary and expedient. The procedures must be as prescribed for the securing of an injunction or for the abatement of hazards in the laws of this state or under the rules and practices of the court.

      The board of directors of a rural fire protection district, with other state and federal agencies, may evaluate the need for firebreaks and ensure that unprotected acreage enrolled in the conservation reserve program is dissected into approximately one-hundred-sixty-acre [64.75-hectare] containment areas for fire control. In developing plans for firebreaks, the board shall make the best possible use of existing natural and artificial barriers, such as lakes, streams, wetlands with water, ponds, clean tilled cropland, gravel pits, and roads. For purposes of this section, a firebreak means a strip of fire-retarding vegetation, no less than thirty feet [9.14 meters] nor more than fifty feet [45.72 meters] wide.

    Fire protection policy to be determined — Financial report — Tax levy limit — Voter — approved levy authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of directors shall determine a general fire protection policy for the district and shall annually estimate the probable expense for carrying out the contemplated program. The annual estimate of probable expense may include an amount determined by the board of directors to be necessary to be carried over to a future year for purchase of firefighting equipment, ambulances, or other emergency vehicles. The estimate must be certified by the president and secretary to the proper county auditor or county auditors, on or before June thirtieth of each year, who shall levy a tax upon the taxable property within the district for the maintenance of the fire protection district for the fiscal year as provided by law. In the year for which the levy is sought, a board of directors of a rural fire protection district seeking approval of a property tax levy under this chapter must file with the county auditor of the counties within the rural fire district, at a time and in a format prescribed by the county auditors, a financial report for the preceding calendar year showing the ending balances of each fund held by the rural fire protection district during that year. The tax may not exceed a tax rate of five mills per dollar of the taxable valuation of property in the district except upon resolution adopted by the board of directors and approval by a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question at an annual or special meeting of electors called by the board of directors, the levy may be made in an amount not exceeding thirteen mills. If an election to approve or reauthorize an excess levy will be held at an annual or special meeting of electors of the district called by the board of directors, notice of the meeting and the proposed excess levy election must be provided by at least one publication in the official newspaper of each county in which the district is located at least seven days, but not more than fourteen days, before the date of the public meeting. The published notice must include the amount of the proposed tax rate increase in mills and the duration for which elector approval of the increase is sought and must include the location where, and hours during which, ballots may be cast.
     </p>
     <p>
      Votes to approve or disapprove the levy increase must be cast on the date of the meeting. The polling place must remain open for at least six hours on the date of the meeting. The secretary-treasurer of the district shall prepare and distribute to qualified electors at the polling place paper ballots to conduct the election on the question of increased levy authority. Three election judges to receive and count the ballots, who are qualified electors of the district but not members of the board, must be selected at least seven days before the meeting by approval of a majority of the members of the board. A marked ballot must be delivered to one of the judges, folded to conceal its contents, the judge shall deposit it in the ballot box, and another judge shall enter the name of the elector who cast the ballot in the pollbook. When the election is closed, the judges shall count the ballots and announce the result. Results of the election must be certified by the secretary-treasurer of the district and each of the election judges to the tax commissioner and to the county auditor of each county in which the district is located within ten days after the election. The certificate must include a statement of the question as it appeared on the ballot, together with the total number of votes cast in favor, and the number of votes cast against, authorizing the excess levy.
     </p>
     <p>
      After July 31, 2015, approval or reauthorization by electors of increased levy authority under this section may not be effective for more than ten taxable years or the period of time necessary for repayment of indebtedness incurred which was intended to be repaid from the increased levy, whichever expires later. Additional levy authority authorized by the board of directors after petition of electors before August 1, 2015, remains in effect under the provisions of law at the time the levy was authorized for the time period authorized by the electors but not exceeding ten taxable years or the period of time necessary for repayment of indebtedness incurred which was intended to be repaid from the increased levy, whichever expires later. The tax must be:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t18c18-10s18-10-07ol11">
       Collected as other taxes are collected in the county.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c18-10s18-10-07ol12">
       Turned over to the secretary-treasurer of the rural fire protection district, who shall have a surety bond in the amount of at least five thousand dollars.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c18-10s18-10-07ol13">
       Placed to the credit of the rural fire protection district so authorizing the same by its secretary-treasurer in a state or national bank, except amounts to be carried over to a future year for purchase of firefighting equipment, ambulances, or other emergency vehicles may be invested to earn the maximum return available.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c18-10s18-10-07ol14">
       Paid out upon warrants drawn upon the fund by authority of the board of directors of the district, bearing the signature of the secretary-treasurer and the countersignature of the president of the rural fire protection district.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The amount of tax levy may not exceed the amount of funds required to defray the expenses of the district for a period of one year as embraced in the annual estimate of expense, including the amount of principal and interest upon the indebtedness of the district for the ensuing year and including any amount determined by the board of directors to be necessary to be carried over to a future year for purchase of firefighting equipment, ambulances, or other emergency vehicles.

       Retirement benefits for members reaching the retirement date equal an annual amount, payable monthly, comprised of a service benefit that equals two and fifty hundredths percent of final salary at the time of the member’s retirement multiplied by the number of years of service employment up to a maximum of thirty years. For purposes of this subsection, final salary for a first-class firefighter is the final salary at the time of the member’s retirement and for officers or members of higher rank is the average salary for the last five years of employment. As used in this subsection, salary does not include overtime or longevity payments.

Disability benefits are not payable for a disability that occurs in a firefighter’s first year of membership in the association. The disability pension amount is equal to a percentage of the monthly salary of a first-class firefighter on January thirty-first of the year that the pension is paid, unless the member is eligible for a larger service pension, in which case the member is entitled to draw an annual pension amount equal to the member’s service pension. The percentage of the monthly salary of a first-class firefighter which is payable as a disability pension is dependent upon the member’s years of service as follows:

However, when a member is no longer receiving workforce safety and insurance benefits or other similar benefits, the member’s disability pension is payable in the amount as determined under this subsection without regard to workforce safety and insurance benefits or other similar benefits, including the greater of the amount of the disability pension or the service pension, if applicable.

Upon return of the member’s accumulated contributions, all of the member’s rights and benefits under the plan are forfeited and terminated. Upon any re-employment, a firefighter may not receive credit for years or completed months of service for which the firefighter has withdrawn the firefighter’s accumulated contributions from the plan, unless the firefighter repays into the plan the contributions the firefighter has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety days after the firefighter’s re-employment. A member may voluntarily leave the member’s accumulated contributions in the plan for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the department pending the possibility of being re-employed as a firefighter, without losing credit for the time that the member was a member of the plan. If a member who is not vested is not re-employed as a firefighter with the department within five years, the member’s accumulated contributions must be returned.

When a member eligible to receive a disability pension attains the member’s normal retirement date, the member’s monthly benefit equals the greater of the disability pension after adjustment for other income or the service pension.

This reduction must be redetermined each year. For purposes of this provision, earned income is all income reported or reportable for federal income tax purposes, excluding passive income, but including wages, salary, commissions, and similar pay from any gainful work, including partnership profits when applicable. For purposes of this provision, passive income is interest, rent, receipts, inheritance payments, private disability insurance, or other payments not related to wages. Other insurance payments received by a disabled member of the association for disability must be included in the excess dollar calculation without any reduction for taxes or other miscellaneous payments. For purposes of this provision, insurance includes disability benefits provided by the city or under workers’ compensation or similar legislation, as well as primary and dependent disability benefits provided under social security. Any lump sum payment attributable to wages or insurance payments received by the member will be prorated over the period of time for which the payment is intended to provide benefits.

In such case, the three physicians thus chosen shall examine the applicant and report to the board.

         Normal form of benefit. For a member married at retirement, the normal form of payment of the service pension or deferred vested pension is a monthly payment for the member’s lifetime, with fifty percent of this amount payable to the member’s surviving spouse. For a member who is not married at retirement, the normal form of payment is a monthly payment for the member’s lifetime, with no survivor payments, but actuarially adjusted as described in subdivision b as if the member were married to a spouse of the same age.

          <li id="t18c18-11s18-11-28ol15b1">

           Certain and life annuity. A monthly benefit payable for the member’s lifetime, but with one hundred twenty payments guaranteed. If the member dies before receiving one hundred twenty payments, monthly payments will be made to the member’s designated beneficiary or estate until one hundred twenty payments have been paid.
          </li>
          <li id="t18c18-11s18-11-28ol15b3">
           Joint and survivor annuity. A monthly benefit payable for the member’s life, plus payments equal to seventy-five percent or one hundred percent of this benefit amount to the member’s spouse following the member’s death. Under this option, the surviving spouse is the member’s spouse at the time of retirement. If the spouse dies before the member, no benefits will be paid to a survivor following the member’s death.

         Benefit selection. A member may select one of the optional forms of payment in subdivision b during the ninety days prior to the member’s actual retirement, or upon attaining normal retirement age, on a form provided by the board. The selection may be changed at any time before cashing or depositing the first retirement payment. Consent of the member’s spouse is not required to select or change an optional benefit form. A member may change the beneficiary designated under the certain and life payment form at any time prior to the member’s death by filing a new selection form with the board. The beneficiary’s consent is not required. If a member dies after having completed and filed a selection form with the board, but before actually retiring, the board shall direct that payments be made as if the member had retired on the member’s date of death and had selected the optional payment indicated in the member’s form. If a member dies after reaching normal retirement age without having completed a selection form, the board shall direct that payments be made as if the member had retired on the member’s date of death, and had selected the joint and one hundred percent survivor optional payment form if the member was married on the member’s date of death, or the certain and life form if the member was not married. If the member’s spouse dies after the member has filed forms with the board selecting a joint and survivor benefit form, but before cashing or depositing the first retirement payment, and if the member does not file a revised selection form, the board shall direct that payments be made under subdivision a, providing for payments to a member who is not married at retirement.

         Children’s benefit. If a vested active or vested deferred member dies before retirement, a monthly benefit must be paid to the member’s surviving children until age nineteen, or until completion of high school, whichever occurs first. The benefit amount to be shared among the children is equal to a percentage of the top paid firefighter’s monthly salary on January thirty-first of the year the benefit is paid. The percentage is determined based on the number of children at the time of each benefit payment and whether the children’s parent is alive. If the children’s surviving parent is alive, the percentage is twenty percent. If no parent survives, and there is more than one child, the percentage is sixty percent. If there is no parent and only one child, the percentage is forty percent. Children who were living while the deceased was on the payroll of the department, or who were born within nine months after the decedent was withdrawn from the payroll of the department, are eligible for this benefit.

         Payment of benefits. Monthly benefit payments must be distributed on the last day of each month. For service or deferred pensions, the first payment must be prorated to equal the total monthly benefit earned, times the number of days in the month following actual retirement, divided by the total number of days in the month. Benefits payable to the surviving beneficiary of a retired member who had been receiving payments commence in the month following the retired member’s death. Benefits payable to the surviving spouse or children of a member who dies before retirement must be similarly prorated based on the date of death of the active or deferred member. The final monthly benefit paid in the month a retired member dies, a surviving beneficiary dies, or a surviving beneficiary ceases to be eligible for benefits must be paid on the last day of the month of death or termination of eligibility and must equal a full monthly payment with no reduction or proration.

       Where parents taught their children at home, the court found the primary use of their dwelling house was as a home, not a school; because they lived in their home, they educated their children there and not vice versa. The instruction of their children was incidental to the primary purpose of the occupancy of the dwelling house; therefore, the part of the N.F.P.A. Code regulating private school buildings did not apply to them and they had to comply with regulations for a one-family dwelling. Birst v. Sanstead, 493 N.W.2d 690, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       In each state, the state forester or officer holding the equivalent position who is responsible for forest fire control may act as compact administrator for that state and may consult with like officials of the other member states and may implement cooperation between the states in forest fire prevention and control. The compact administrators of the member states may organize to coordinate the services of the member states and provide administrative integration in carrying out the purpose of this compact.
