        District court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of a correctional facility and in finding that former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12c12-44.1s12-44.1-12" target="_self">12-44.1-12.</a></cite>1(3)(a) did not limit the charge to an inmate’s account for a medical visit requested by him to a maximum of $10, and the facility was authorized to withdraw the full amount of the dental services provided to the inmate in the amount of $275.
   Wheeler v. Gardner, 2006 ND 24, 708 N.W.2d 908, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>
        Logical interpretation of former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12c12-44.1s12-44.1-12" target="_self">12-44.1-12.</a></cite>1(3)(a) when read in context with the entire statute, is that it authorizes an additional charge of $10 for each medical visit made at the request of the inmate. The inmate remains liable for the full amount of the actual medical costs incurred.
   Wheeler v. Gardner, 2006 ND 24, 708 N.W.2d 908, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature’s inclusion in former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12c12-44.1s12-44.1-12" target="_self">12-44.1-12.</a></cite>1(3) of other provisions authorizing reimbursement for the total amount of medical costs incurred is a clear expression of the legislature’s intent that the $10 fee in former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12c12-44.1s12-44.1-12" target="_self">12-44.1-12.</a></cite>1(3)(a) is not a maximum charge, but rather is an additional fee for each requested medical visit. The statute thereby allows the Correctional Center to recoup some of the expense of arranging and transporting the inmate to an outside appointment or providing on-site health care services, and also serves to deter inmates from excessive and frivolous requests for medical visits.
   Wheeler v. Gardner, 2006 ND 24, 708 N.W.2d 908, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        “After hours” fee charged for dental services provided outside normal office hours is a “health care cost” under the statute. The Supreme Court of North Dakota believes it is commonly understood that any item directly related to, and billed by the health care provider as, a medical or dental service is a “health care cost.”

      An inmate is financially responsible for the costs of medical or health care, except for an intake health care assessment and related testing for an examination of the inmate made at the request of the facility. The correctional facility may seek reimbursement from the inmate up to the total amount of incurred medical or health care costs. If the inmate has health insurance coverage, a medical or health care provider shall file a claim for reimbursement from the health insurance provider. If the inmate does not have health insurance coverage and the inmate’s medical or health care costs are the responsibility of the correctional facility, the correctional facility’s responsibility may not exceed the rates paid under the federal Medicare program. If elective medical or health care is allowed by a correctional facility policy, the inmate must arrange payment for elective medical or health care before receiving care.

     <p>
      Whenever a district court finds an offender under eighteen years of age guilty of a crime and commits the offender to the custody of the department of corrections and rehabilitation, the department may transfer the offender to the North Dakota youth correctional center; however, the department shall first transfer the offender to the North Dakota youth correctional center if the offender is under sixteen years of age. The department may allow an offender who is between eighteen years of age and twenty years of age to remain at the North Dakota youth correctional center if the department determines that it is in the best interests of the department and the offender and it is not contrary to safety interests of the other residents or the general public. The department shall transfer an offender who has attained twenty years of age to an adult correctional facility. An offender placed by the department at the North Dakota youth correctional center under this section has all the rights to sentence reduction for good and meritorious conduct and all the pardon and parole rights of an adult committed to the legal and physical custody of the department.

        Placement of a prisoner in maximum security is an administrative decision, made for the protection of the other people in the institution, and where defendant’s treatment is no different from the treatment given other prisoners under similar circumstances, it does not constitute cruel or unusual punishment.

       The warden of the penitentiary shall keep an account for each inmate. Not more than fifty percent of an inmate’s penitentiary earnings, as provided by penitentiary rules, must be withheld from an inmate and deposited in a separate account for the inmate and may not be made available to the inmate until the inmate’s release from the penitentiary, except as authorized by the warden. The remainder of an inmate’s earnings must be made available to the inmate on a regular basis.

       Inmates may, in writing, authorize the warden or designee to deposit any of their accumulated earnings from the prison industries, hobby, work release, or any other prison program in an interest-earning account in the Bank of North Dakota for the benefit of the inmate. The account must be a two-signature account requiring the inmate’s signature and that of an authorized designated officer or employee of the state penitentiary for withdrawal.

      <li id="t12c12-48s12-48-15ol13">
       The warden may directly deposit an inmate’s funds from sources outside of the penitentiary in any bank or account the inmate may designate. If a court order does not allow an inmate to designate a bank or account other than a Bank of North Dakota account or if it is necessary for the benefit and protection of the inmate, the warden, upon written explanation to the inmate, shall deposit an inmate’s funds from sources outside the penitentiary into a Bank of North Dakota account. The department of corrections and rehabilitation and its divisions, departments, officers, and employees may not be held responsible or liable for any inmate income or funds deposited into a bank or account designated by an inmate.
      </li>
      <li id="t12c12-48s12-48-15ol14">
       The warden is responsible for guiding inmates in making proper use of their funds to pay their obligations, including the payment of any administratively ordered fee, fine or restitution, court-appointed counsel fees, court-ordered restitution, support for dependent relatives, or to provide for their own medical, surgical, eye care, or dental treatment, or to pay for other services not generally provided by the state. The warden may withdraw funds from an inmate’s penitentiary account or Bank of North Dakota two-signature account, without the inmate’s signature, to meet the inmate’s legitimate financial obligations. Before the funds may be withdrawn, the inmate must first receive written notice and be provided a penitentiary administrative hearing with the right to appeal according to department of corrections and rehabilitation rules. An inmate is not entitled to prior written notice, administrative hearing, or right to an appeal to the department of corrections and rehabilitation when funds are to be withdrawn for payment of a court-ordered obligation, including child support, provided the inmate has had notice and an opportunity to be heard in the court proceedings.

       The warden may pay an inmate all funds in the inmate’s spending account, less the inmate’s outstanding obligations to the penitentiary, when the inmate is transferred to a county jail or regional correctional center or placed in community corrections confinement. The warden may pay an inmate all funds in the inmate’s account, less the inmate’s outstanding obligations to the penitentiary, when the inmate is transferred to a correctional facility outside of this state. The warden shall pay an inmate all funds in the inmate’s account, less the inmate’s outstanding obligations to the penitentiary, when the inmate is released on parole or discharged from the penitentiary.

        Where an inmate’s personal inmate account consisted of a tax refund which was commingled with his prison wages, and his actual Air Force pension was not in his personal inmate account, assuming that his tax refund retained its status as exempt veteran’s benefits and that federal law would have entitled him to claim an exemption from court costs for those benefits, the tax refund was not in his personal inmate account when that account was debited on February 5, 1992. After his tax refund was deposited in his personal inmate account, the individual state defendants were not informed that it was in any way derived from veteran’s benefits until he filed an action. Since he did not claim an exemption, the individual state defendants could not be expected to know that he was claiming a federal exemption without being notified of that fact. Jensen v.

       <p>
        The direction that a judge make the reasons for a sentence a part of the record would have some usefulness in assisting the board of pardons or the parole board to determine under prior law whether to shorten or commute a sentence or to release a prisoner on parole. State v. Ennis, 464 N.W.2d 378, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 261</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A failure to file a statement concerning the character and habits of a person sentenced to serve an indeterminate term of from one to three years did not render the sentence so indefinite as to require a discharge at the expiration of the minimum term. Ex parte Riley, 52 N.D. 471, 203 N.W. 676, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 1925).

      The parole board shall establish parole expiration dates in all parole cases.

The length of the period of parole may not be extended more than five years for a felony and two years for a misdemeanor beyond the date that the court-imposed sentence would have otherwise expired had parole not been granted. The parole board may allow a parolee to earn performance-based parole reduction at the rate of up to five days per month in accordance with performance criteria established by the parole board. The board may terminate a parolee’s supervision at any time earlier than the established date of release from parole if the parole board determines that early termination of supervision is warranted and termination of supervision is in the interest of justice. The parole board may not terminate supervision for a parolee who has a life sentence with opportunity for parole earlier than five years from the established date of release on parole.

        Definition of “Peace Officer.”

       The meaning of “peace officer,” as explained in subdivision 17 of N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-01-04, applied to former N.D.C.C. ch. 12-62. The training was mandatory for any “public servant authorized…to enforce the law and to conduct or engage in investigations or prosecutions for violations of law.” This definition certainly included law enforcement officers, other than detectives, without excluding those engaged in jail or detention work.

      In a case of alleged parole or probation violation by an offender being supervised in another state pursuant to the interstate compact for the supervision of adult offenders, any appropriate judicial or administrative officer or agency in another state is authorized to hold a hearing on the alleged violation. Upon receipt of the record of a parole or probation violation hearing held in another state pursuant to a statute substantially similar to this chapter, the record has the same standing and effect as though the proceeding of which it is a record was had before the appropriate officer or officers in this state, and any recommendations contained in or accompanying the record must be fully considered by the appropriate officer or officers of this state in making disposition of the matter.

      An offender who is on parole or probation in another state, who is present in this state without the permission of the compact administrator, and who does not leave this state within seven days after being notified in writing by a law enforcement officer that the offender may not remain in this state without the permission of the compact administrator is guilty of a class C felony. Within twenty-four hours after a law enforcement officer has notified an offender that the offender may not remain within the state without the permission of the compact administrator, the law enforcement officer shall report the notification to the designated officer. An offender who is on parole or probation in another state may not remain in this state without the permission of the compact administrator. In a prosecution for an offense under this section, an offender’s good-faith belief that the offender received permission to be present in this state is an affirmative defense if the offender acted in reasonable reliance upon the written statements of an authorized officer of this state or the state in which the offender is on parole or probation. This defense is not available to a person who remains present in this state after being notified in writing by the compact administrator that the offender does not have permission to be present.

        ARTICLE I — PURPOSE
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that the United States Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act [Pub. L. 89-554; 80 Stat. 608; 4 U.S.C. 112] has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t12c12-66s12-66-01-Sourceol11">
        Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;

       <li id="t12c12-66s12-66-01-Sourceol12">
        Ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;

The provisions of this compact must be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

       The commission consists of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state and in consultation with the state council for interstate juvenile supervision. The commissioner is the compact administrator, deputy compact administrator, or designee from that state who serves on the commission in that capacity under or pursuant to the applicable law of the compacting state.

       In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the commission must include individuals who are not commissioners, but who are members of interested organizations. The noncommissioner members include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general, interstate compact for adult offender supervision, interstate compact for the placement of children, juvenile justice and juvenile corrections officials, and crime victims. All noncommissioner members of the commission are nonvoting members.

       Once effective, the compact continues in force and remains binding upon every compacting state, but a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact into law. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal. The withdrawing state shall notify the chairman of the commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state’s intent to withdraw within sixty days of receipt of the notice. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state occurs upon the withdrawing state re-enacting the compact or upon a later date as determined by the interstate commission.
      </p>

       <b>
        2.
       </b>
       If the commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the bylaws or rules of the commission, the commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        a.
       </b>
       Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the commission;

        b.
       </b>
       Alternative dispute resolution;
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        c.
       </b>
       Fines, fees, and costs in those amounts as are determined to be reasonable as fixed by the commission; and
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        d.
       </b>
       Suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which may be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the commission has determined that the offending state is in default.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        3.
       </b>
       The commission, by majority vote of the members, may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the commission, in the federal district where the commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the compact, its duly promulgated rules, and bylaws against any compacting state in default. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of the litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        4.
       </b>
       The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes void and the business and affairs of the commission must be concluded and any surplus funds must be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.

        ARTICLE XII — BINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        1.
       </b>
       This compact does not prevent the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state which is consistent with this compact. All compacting states’ laws other than the Constitution of North Dakota and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        2.
       </b>
       All lawful actions of the commission, including all rules and bylaws adopted by the commission, are binding upon the compacting states.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        3.
       </b>
       All agreements between the commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        4.
       </b>
       Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the commission may issue advisory opinions regarding the meaning or interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        5.
       </b>
       In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by the provision upon the commission are ineffective and the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction remain in the compacting state and must be exercised by the agency to which the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.

       Notwithstanding subsection 1, if, upon receiving sufficient information from the person making the report, the law enforcement agency that receives the initial report of a missing person determines that a law enforcement agency in another jurisdiction is clearly the more appropriate law enforcement agency to receive the missing person report, the law enforcement agency that receives the initial report may refer the missing person report to the more appropriate law enforcement agency. The responsibility for the missing person report remains with the law enforcement agency that receives the initial missing person report until the law enforcement agency in the other jurisdiction confirms, in writing, its acceptance of responsibility for the missing person report. If the law enforcement agency to which the missing person report is referred is located within this state, that law enforcement agency shall accept or decline the responsibility for the referred missing person report within twenty-four hours after receiving the request from the initial law enforcement agency. The law enforcement agency to which the report is referred may not decline acceptance of responsibility for the missing person report without good cause shown and may not decline acceptance of responsibility for the report solely on the basis of the factors listed in subsection 1.
