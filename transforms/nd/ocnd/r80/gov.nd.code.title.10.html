       The appointment of a registered agent under this section does not qualify a nonqualified foreign entity to do business in this state and is not sufficient alone to create personal jurisdiction over the nonqualified foreign entity in this state.

       A statement appointing an agent for service of process may not be rejected for filing because the name of the entity filing the statement is not distinguishable on the records of the secretary of state from the name of another entity appearing in those records. The filing of a statement appointing an agent for service of process does not make the name of the entity filing the statement unavailable for use by another entity.

       An entity that has filed a statement appointing an agent for service of process may cancel the statement by filing a statement of cancellation, which shall take effect upon filing, and must state the name of the entity and that the entity is canceling its appointment of an agent for service of process in this state. A statement appointing an agent for service of process, which has not been canceled earlier, is effective for a period of five years after the date of filing. The secretary of state may destroy a statement provided for in this section after the statement has been on file for six years.

        District court improperly granted summary judgment on investors’
   fraud claims under N.D.C.C. ch. 10-04 where there was a fact issue about whether an attorney was an agent, as defined by N.D.C.C. § 10-04-02(1), and could be held liable for violations of the Securities Act. Whether the attorney personally violated N.D.C.C. § 10-04-15 did not matter because under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-17, the person making such sale or contract for sale, and every director, officer, or agent of or for such seller who shall have participated or aided in any way in making such sale was jointly and severally liable to such purchaser. If another defendant seller violated N.D.C.C. § 10-04-15 by making fraudulent statements and omitting material information in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of the securities, and the attorney was an agent, the attorney was liable for the violation under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t10c10-04s10-04-17" target="_self">10-04-17.</a></cite>
   Ward v. Bullis, 2008 ND 80, 748 N.W.2d 397, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was improperly granted to an attorney because there were genuine issues of fact as to whether the attorney was an agent under the Securities Act. The attorney would have been liable under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-17 for sale or contracts for sale made in violation of the Securities Act if he met the statutory definition of an agent, under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-02(1), and he participated or aided in any way in the sale of the securities.
   Ward v. Bullis, 2008 ND 80, 748 N.W.2d 397, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attorney may be liable for violations of the Securities Act if he is an agent representing the broker-dealer, issuer, or is self-employed and effects or attempts to effect the purchase or sale of securities, and he participates or aids in any way in the sale or contract for sale made in violation of the Securities Act; however, an attorney who merely provides legal services, drafts documents used in the purchase or sale of the security, or engages in the legal profession’s traditional advisory functions is not an agent within the meaning of N.D.C.C. § 10-04-02(1). To be liable as an agent, the attorney must do more than act as legal counsel, the attorney must actively assist in offering securities for sale, solicit offers to buy, or actually perform the sale.
   Ward v. Bullis, 2008 ND 80, 748 N.W.2d 397, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 2008).

        While defendant claimed that he was not required to register as an agent under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-10(2) because, as part owner of the issuer, he was therefore an “issuer” and was exempt from registration, the court upheld the decision because federal law did not preempt state securities laws requiring the registration of individuals involved in the sale of securities, and defendant was required to register as an agent because he represented an issuer and was not exempt from registration.

        Corporate notes, offered to shareholders of another corporation in exchange for their stock as a part of a plan by first corporation to gain control of the other, were “evidence of indebtedness” under former subsection 12 (now subsection 19) of this section and were required to be registered, and it was no defense to the charged violation of this requirement that the contract resulting from such offer was void for lack of consideration or mutuality. State v. Davis, 131 N.W.2d 730, 1964 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1964).

       <p>
        In a securities action involving the renewal of three promissory notes, where the issue was whether, on the dates in question, defendant’s conduct constituted a sale or offer to sell unregistered or non-exempt securities, the trial court correctly instructed the jury on the definition of security, on sale or sell, and on offer for sale or offer to sell under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-02, and the court’s instructions adequately informed the jury on those issues. Furthermore, the court did not err in not including language from Liberty Nat’l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Dvorak, 199 N.W.2d 414 (N.D. 1972) to the effect that “a note is renewed when a new note evidencing the same obligation is executed and delivered by the maker to the holder of the old note,”
   because
   North Dakota securities law does not distinguish between a new note and a renewal for purposes of a securities violation.
   Had defendant been entitled to a defense based on his theory of renewal, his requested language was effectively included in the trial court’s instruction from Dvorak.

        A note is a security and every person who, for all or part of his time, engages in selling notes issued by such person is a dealer and issuance of personal promissory notes by an individual constitutes sale of securities. A dealer is not exempted from registration merely because he is making isolated sales and notes need not be negotiable to come within Securities Act since issuer and dealer may be same person. A party who gave notes in return for personal loans was making sales of securities within meaning of act and where he made nine separate sales in two and one-half months, he was engaged “all or part of his time” in selling securities and therefore was a dealer and subject to prosecution for failure to register as such. State v. Weisser, 161 N.W.2d 360, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 1968).

        Promissory note is a “note” within the definition of a “security” and the act of disposing of promissory notes for value is a sale and thus within the provisions of the Securities Act.

        Because North Dakota securities law applied to transaction, purchaser of stock, in order to be entitled to rescission, needed only to prove that seller, in connection with the offer of his stock for sale, omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

        In the definition of “security”, the phrase “or other arrangement in which persons invest in a common enterprise the returns of which depend to any extent upon introducing other persons to participate or invest in the enterprise”, does not modify or condition the words which precede it and does not modify nor restrict the instruments listed in the definition, but rather increases the instruments included within the definition of “security”. State v. Goetz, 312 N.W.2d 1, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 421</cite> (N.D. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 924, 102 S. Ct. 1286, 71 L. Ed. 2d 467, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 728 (U.S. 1982).

      The commissioner may by order or regulation suspend or revoke any exemption under section 10-04-05 or 10-04-06 with respect to any specific security or transaction or may require with respect to any specific security or transaction, prior to the making of any offers or sales, such information with respect thereto or the security to be offered or sold thereunder or such reports after the making of such sales, as the commissioner may deem necessary to enable the commissioner to determine whether or not to suspend or revoke the exemption. No such order may be entered without appropriate prior notice to all interested parties, opportunity for hearing, and written findings of fact and conclusions of law, except that the commissioner may by order summarily suspend any of the specified exemptions pending final determination of any proceeding under this section. Upon the entry of a summary order, the commissioner shall promptly notify all interested parties that it has been entered and the reasons therefor and that within fifteen days of the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of and opportunity for a hearing to all interested parties, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination.

    Suspension or revocation of registration of securities.

      The commissioner may revoke the registration of any securities registered under this chapter if, after a hearing or opportunity for hearing as provided in section 10-04-12, the commissioner finds that any provisions of this chapter or any rule, order, or condition lawfully imposed under this chapter has been violated, or if the commissioner finds any of the following:

       The sale of such securities would work or tend to work a fraud, or deception upon the purchasers thereof or the public, or that the disposal of the securities is on unfair terms, or if the plan of business of the applicant appears to be unfair, unjust, or inequitable.

      <li id="t10c10-04s10-04-09ol13">
       The issuer of such securities has made any fraudulent representations in any prospectus or in any circular or other literature that has been distributed concerning the issuer or its securities.

      <li id="t10c10-04s10-04-09ol14">
       The issuer of such securities has refused to permit an examination into its affairs as provided in this section or has failed to furnish the commissioner any further information required pursuant to this section.

      <li id="t10c10-04s10-04-09ol15">
       No action may be brought under this section by the commissioner after ten years from the date of the alleged violation.

     </ol>
     <p>
      If the commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the registration of any securities registered under this chapter should be revoked upon any ground specified in this section, the commissioner or the commissioner’s agent may conduct an examination into the affairs of the issuer of such securities; provided, that the commissioner or the commissioner’s agent may conduct such an examination only if the information sought by such examination could not be obtained from other readily available sources. In making any such examination, the commissioner or the commissioner’s agent shall have access to and may compel the production of all the books and papers of an issuer and may administer oaths to and examine the officers and any employees of such issuer as to its business and affairs. They may also require a balance sheet exhibiting the assets and liabilities of any such issuer or the issuer’s income statement, or both, to be certified to by a certified public accountant. Whenever the commissioner may deem it necessary in connection with any such examination, the commissioner may also require such balance sheet or income statement, or both, to be made more specific in such particulars as the commissioner shall point out or to be brought down to the latest practicable date. Such examination shall be made at the office of the commissioner, unless the issuer or a registered dealer requests that the examination be made at some other place, in which case the person making such request may be required by the commissioner to advance sufficient funds to pay the actual expenses of such investigation.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the registration of any securities under this chapter should be revoked on any ground specified in this section, the commissioner may enter an order suspending the registration of such securities pending an examination into the affairs of the issuer of such securities or pending a hearing or opportunity for hearing as provided in section 10-04-12; provided, that no such suspension order shall be effective for more than thirty days and such an order, if not withdrawn by the commissioner within thirty days, shall automatically terminate thirty days after the date of its issuance. Such suspension order shall state specifically the grounds for its issuance. Upon the entry of an order suspending the registration of any securities or of an order withdrawing a suspension order previously issued, the commissioner shall send a copy of such order to the issuer of such securities.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the commissioner finds, after a hearing or opportunity for hearing as provided in section 10-04-12, that there are grounds for revoking the registration of certain securities, the commissioner may enter in the register of securities an order revoking the registration of such securities. Such order shall state specifically the grounds for its issuance. Upon the entry of an order revoking the registration of securities, the commissioner shall send a copy of such order to the issuer of such securities. No order revoking the registration of securities shall invalidate any sale of such securities made prior to the entry of such order.

        Where partnership investors sued a corporation, asserting that it participated in the fraudulent sale of interests in partnerships A and B, and failed to register those securities or its dealers in North Dakota, N.D.C.C. §§ 10-04-04 and 10-04-10 did not apply because the action did not involve a sale or offer to sell from or within North Dakota.

       <p>
        Fact that unregistered sale of single note was alleged while this section refers to securities in plural was inconsequential since, under N.D.C.C. § 1-01-35, words used in singular include the plural and vice versa and since error was at best technical in view of proof of sale of several other notes and did not affect any substantial right of accused; gist of offense under this section is selling, in nonexempt transaction, without being registered. State v. Henderson, 156 N.W.2d 700, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A note is a security and every person who, for all or part of his time, engages in selling notes issued by such person is a dealer and issuance of personal promissory notes by an individual constitutes sale of securities. A dealer is not exempted from registration merely because he is making isolated sales and notes need not be negotiable to come within Securities Act since issuer and dealer may be same person. A party who gave notes in return for personal loans was making sales of securities within meaning of act and where he made nine separate sales in two and one-half months, he was engaged “all or part of his time” in selling securities and therefore was a dealer and subject to prosecution for failure to register as such.

        While defendant claimed that he was not required to register as an agent under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-10(2) because, as part owner of the issuer, he was therefore an “issuer” and was exempt from registration, the court upheld the decision because federal law did not preempt state securities laws requiring the registration of individuals involved in the sale of securities, and defendant was required to register as an agent because he represented an issuer and was not exempt from registration.

Within fifteen days after receipt by the commissioner of a written request, the matter will be set for hearing to determine if the order should be modified, vacated, or extended pending a final determination.

A copy of such order shall be sent by registered mail to the broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative whose registration is censured, suspended, or revoked thereby at the person’s business address and, if the censure, suspension, or revocation is of the registration of an agent or investment adviser representative, to the registered broker-dealer or registered investment adviser who employs such person. Suspension or revocation of the registration of a broker-dealer shall also suspend or revoke the registration of all of the broker-dealer’s agents. Suspension or revocation of the registration of an investment adviser also suspends or revokes the registration of all of the investment adviser’s investment adviser representatives.

        District court improperly granted summary judgment on investors’
   fraud claims under N.D.C.C. ch. 10-04 where there was a fact issue about whether an attorney was an agent, as defined by N.D.C.C. § 10-04-02(1), and could be held liable for violations of the Securities Act. Whether the attorney personally violated N.D.C.C. § 10-04-15 did not matter because under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-17, the person making such sale or contract for sale, and every director, officer, or agent of or for such seller who shall have participated or aided in any way in making such sale was jointly and severally liable to such purchaser. If another defendant seller violated N.D.C.C. § 10-04-15 by making fraudulent statements and omitting material information in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of the securities, and the attorney was an agent, the attorney was liable for the violation under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t10c10-04s10-04-17" target="_self">10-04-17.</a></cite>

   common law fraud claims failed because: (1) the conduct on which the fraud claim was based needed to be actionable fraud without the assistance of N.D.C.C. § 10-04-15; (2) N.D.C.C. § 32-03.2-02 did not create an independent basis of liability; (3) the investors presented no evidence that defendant attorney himself made any fraudulent statements and omissions, and (4) they failed to present any evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact that there was a common plan to commit fraud or that the attorney knew that a seller of securities was making fraudulent statements and omitting material information in soliciting investors.

      If it appears to the commissioner, either upon complaint or otherwise, that any person has engaged in, or is engaging in, or is about to engage in any act or practice or transaction that is prohibited by this chapter or by any order of the commissioner issued under this chapter or which is declared to be illegal in this chapter, the commissioner may:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t10c10-04s10-04-16ol11">
       Issue any order, including cease and desist, rescission, stop, and suspension orders, which the commissioner deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. The commissioner may, in addition to any other remedy authorized by this chapter, impose by order and collect a civil penalty against any person found in an administrative action to have violated any provision of this chapter, or any rule or order adopted or issued under this chapter, in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each violation. The commissioner may bring actions to recover penalties pursuant to this section in district court. A person aggrieved by an order issued pursuant to this subsection may request a hearing before the commissioner if a written request is made within fifteen days after receipt of the order. If a request for hearing is made under this subsection, the commissioner shall schedule a hearing within a reasonable time. Subsections 3 and 4 of section 10-04-12 apply to any hearing conducted under this subsection. If, after a hearing, the commissioner sustains an order previously issued, the sustaining order is subject to appeal to the district court of Burleigh County according to the procedures set forth in chapter 28-32. Any order issued under this subsection is a final order if it is properly served and no hearing was requested within the required timeline. If an order issued under this subsection is sustained or modified after a hearing held in accordance with section 10-04-12, the order sustaining or modifying that order is a final order. If the final order is not appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in chapter 28-32 or if the final order is sustained on appeal, the securities department may file a certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction. The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court.

In any proceeding for an injunction, the commissioner may apply for and on due showing be issued the court’s subpoena requiring the appearance forthwith of any defendant and the defendant’s agents, employees, partners, officers, or directors, and the production of the documents, books, and records necessary for the hearing upon the petition for an injunction. Upon proof of any of the offenses described in this section, the court may grant the injunction as the facts warrant, and a receiver or conservator may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant’s assets, and the court may assess civil penalties in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each violation of this chapter, and any rules promulgated thereunder or orders issued thereunder.

        Language of N.D.C.C. ch. 10-04 clearly and unambiguously defines agent in language that is applicable to N.D.C.C. § 10-04-17, and therefore an individual must meet the statutory definition of agent to be held liable as an agent for violations of the Securities Act.
   Ward v. Bullis, 2008 ND 80, 748 N.W.2d 397, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 2008).

       <p>
        District court improperly granted summary judgment on investors’
   fraud claims under N.D.C.C. ch. 10-04 where there was a fact issue about whether an attorney was an agent, as defined by N.D.C.C. § 10-04-02(1), and could be held liable for violations of the Securities Act. Whether the attorney personally violated N.D.C.C. § 10-04-15 did not matter because under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-17, the person making such sale or contract for sale, and every director, officer, or agent of or for such seller who shall have participated or aided in any way in making such sale was jointly and severally liable to such purchaser. If another defendant seller violated N.D.C.C. § 10-04-15 by making fraudulent statements and omitting material information in connection with the offer, sale, or purchase of the securities, and the attorney was an agent, the attorney was liable for the violation under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t10c10-04s10-04-17" target="_self">10-04-17.</a></cite>

       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was improperly granted to an attorney because there were genuine issues of fact as to whether the attorney was an agent under the Securities Act. The attorney would have been liable under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-17 for sale or contracts for sale made in violation of the Securities Act if he met the statutory definition of an agent, under N.D.C.C. § 10-04-02(1), and he participated or aided in any way in the sale of the securities.

        In order for director of corporation to be held liable under this section to purchaser of corporate securities sold to him in violation of Securities Act, he must have participated or aided in some way in making such sale. Weidner v. Engelhart, 176 N.W.2d 509, 1970 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1970).
       </p>

        Copies of minutes of directors’ meetings were properly admitted into evidence on the issue of the president’s activities and knowledge with respect to the sales of subordinate debentures even though the minutes did not show that such activities and knowledge specifically related to the sale of the debenture in question to the plaintiffs; it was not necessary that plaintiffs show that the president knew of the particular sale and had a personal hand in its transaction. Schollmeyer v. Saxowsky, 211 N.W.2d 377, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction that “a director or an officer of a corporation could be liable for aiding or participating in an illegal sale of securities irrespective of the care and diligence each exercised in the conduct of the business of the corporation” was permissible since the amount of care and diligence exercised by an officer or a director in the exercise of his office is not relevant to an illegal sale under this section and therefore should not be considered by the jury. Schollmeyer v. Saxowsky, 211 N.W.2d 377, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since liability under this section can be placed on a director without his having personal contact with the purchaser, jury was justified in finding that president aided in illegal sale of subordinate debenture to plaintiffs where he had been made manager of finance procurement for corporation and was specially compensated therefor, was aware of difficulties with securities commissioner over licensing of salesmen and registration of the debentures, hired employee whom he must have known was not a licensed security salesman, and where he knew that unlicensed salesman was selling securities in the form of subordinate debentures involved in the controversy.

        In action by the purchasers of securities against a bank which was acting as trustee and registrar for the issuing corporation, instruction stating that the fact the bank was a trustee of the issue and as such became the depository of funds paid by the plaintiffs did not amount to “participation or aid in the making of the sale to the plaintiffs” within the meaning of this section unless it was shown by preponderance of the evidence that the bank had, at the time of the issuance of the securities, knowledge of security violations by the principal.

        Clause in subordinate debenture contract which denied purchaser of debenture any right to seek recourse for payment of principal, interest or premium from incorporator, stockholder, officer or director of the company, or of any predecessor or successor corporation was invalid since such waiver of liability tended to the oppression of the rights of purchasers as expressed in this section and was therefore contrary to public policy.

       In criminal prosecution for offering for sale or selling securities when not registered as a dealer or salesman, and for offering for sale or selling unregistered securities, defendant had the burden of proving the existence of an exemption as a defense; state was not required to prove the nonexistence of an exemption as an element of the crime charged. State v. Goetz, 312 N.W.2d 1, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 421</cite> (N.D. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 924, 102 S. Ct. 1286, 71 L. Ed. 2d 467, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 728 (U.S. 1982).

       This section’s requirement that criminal defendant claiming an exemption as a defense has the burden of proving such exemption does not constitute an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant.

        Family farm exception prevented foreign corporations and foreign limited liability companies from engaging in the business of farming or owning farm land in North Dakota while permitting North Dakota corporations and limited liability companies to do so, thus, by definition, the statute had a discriminatory effect and violated the dormant Commerce Clause.

       The disposition requirement does not apply to a corporation or limited liability company that has acquired title to the land through the process of foreclosure of a mortgage, or a deed from a mortgagor instead of a foreclosure, if, by the expiration of one month after what is or what would have been the redemption period of the mortgage if the mortgage had been foreclosed, that corporation or limited liability company leases to the prior mortgagor from whom it was acquired, with an option to purchase, and if documents evidencing the lease agreement have been filed with the recorder of each county in which the land is located. A copy of a notice of lease is sufficient evidence. The exemption in this subsection applies for only five years and then only if the property has been appraised in accordance with subsection 8.

        Because former N.D.C.C. § 10-06-13 was the more recent enactment, state banks were subject to the three-year divestiture period under subsection (5) of that section with regard to farmland or ranchland, rather than the five-year period under former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.06.html#t06c6-03s6-03-09" target="_blank">6-03-09.</a></cite> State v.

        Former N.D.C.C. § 10-06-13 was not preempted by 12 USCS § 29 of the National Bank Act; therefore, the district court erred in determining that the three-year divestiture requirement under subsection 5 of that section was not applicable to the national bank.

        Where a large amount of land owned by the corporate defendant was in a small area and there were difficulties attendant with providing a fair opportunity to realize the value of that amount of land in such an area, farmland values were unstable, and the defendant was arguably in compliance with the Corporate Farming Law when the period of divestiture was ten years, a more appropriate period of divestiture was ten years from the effective date of the 1981 amendments, and the defendant would be required to either comply with the provisions of former N.D.C.C. ch. 10-06, or divest itself to its farmland by July 1, 1991.

      If a shareholder owns less than fifty percent of the shares of a farming or ranching corporation doing business under this chapter, and if the terms and conditions for the repurchase of those shares by the corporation or by the other shareholders are not set forth in the bylaws or the instrument which transferred the shares to the shareholder, or are not the subject of a shareholders’ agreement or an agreement between that shareholder and the corporation, then the disposition of such shares must be determined by this section upon the withdrawal of the shareholder. Any shareholder who desires to withdraw from the corporation shall first offer the shares for sale to the remaining shareholders in proportion to the shares owned by them. If not all of the shareholders wish to purchase the shares, any one shareholder may purchase all of the shares of the withdrawing shareholder. If no shareholder desires to purchase the shares of a withdrawing shareholder, then the corporation may purchase the shares. If the corporation chooses not to purchase the shares of the withdrawing shareholder, then the withdrawing shareholder may sell the shares to any other person eligible to be a shareholder. If the withdrawing shareholder is unable to sell the shares to any other person eligible to become a shareholder, then the withdrawing shareholder may bring an action in district court to dissolve the corporation. Upon a finding that the withdrawing shareholder cannot sell the shares at a fair price, the court shall enter an order directing that the corporation itself or any or all of the remaining shareholders pro rata or otherwise shall have twelve months from the date of the court’s order to purchase the shares of the withdrawing shareholder at a fair price as determined by the court and that if the shares of the withdrawing shareholder are not completely purchased at said price, the corporation shall be dissolved and the assets of the corporation shall be first used to pay all the liabilities of the corporation with the remaining net assets to be distributed pro rata to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership of shares. For the purpose of this section, a fair price for the shares of the withdrawing shareholder must be determined as though the shares were being valued for federal gift tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code.

      “Rural area” means any area not included within the boundaries of an incorporated city having a population in excess of two thousand five hundred inhabitants at the time a corporation or cooperative commences to operate electric facilities or to furnish electric energy in such an area, and includes both the farm and nonfarm population thereof. No change thereafter in the population of a rural area, as defined herein, regardless of the reason for such change, shall operate to affect in any way its status as a rural area for the purposes of this chapter.

      The initial bylaws of a cooperative may be adopted by the temporary board. Thereafter, bylaws may be adopted and amended only by the members, unless the members adopt a bylaw that permits the board to make and amend specified bylaws. Any bylaw adopted or amended by the board shall be reported at the next regular member meeting. Any such bylaw shall be at any time subject to amendment or repeal by the members. Unless the bylaws provide otherwise, any bylaw may be adopted, amended, or repealed by a majority of the members present at a meeting, provided that the members voting must be sufficient in number to constitute a quorum as provided in this chapter or the bylaws.

       <p>
        Foreign electric cooperative was an entity that could seek eminent domain as a qualifying foreign cooperative pursuant to N.D.C.C. §§ 10-13-03(7), <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t10c10-15s10-15-52" target="_self">10-15-52.</a></cite> Because N.D.C.C. § 10-15-60 does not restrict the powers afforded under § 10-15-52 to electric cooperatives, which may operate under the general law governing cooperatives as provided in N.D.C.C. § 10-13-01, the district courts properly granted under N.D.C.C. § 32-15-06 the cooperative’s petitions for access to properties along the route of a proposed power transmission line to conduct testing and surveys.

        No Pre-incorporation Contract.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a breach of contract case, there was no error in failing to dismiss a corporation as a party to the action, even though there was no pre-incorporation contract, because the corporation had knowledge of all of the material facts surrounding a transaction where a contractor was the principal shareholder and registered agent of the corporation, and he testified that the corporation received payments under the contract and that the project at issue became the corporation’s at some point. The evidence did not support a finding that a pre-incorporation contract existed based on the date that the corporation came into existence.

       Where purported corporate president had control over the corporate checkbook, which the other members of the corporation did not inspect, and the purported president was the person responsible for drafting the corporation’s corporate documents and filing these documents with the North Dakota Secretary of State, these facts, coupled with the purported president’s representations to the lessor, raised a viable question as to the purported corporate president’s apparent authority to enter into a sale-and-leaseback arrangement with the lessor.
   Weinreis v. Hill, 2005 ND 127, 700 N.W.2d 692, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Airplane lessee, a partnership, was not bound by its partner’s actions in holding himself out as its president and entering a sale-lease back transaction because the leasing company had acted negligently; there were problems with the documentation it had received, there were facts that should have placed the company on notice, or at least on inquiry, that the partner had no actual authority to bind the lessee to the lease agreement, and the company deposited the proceeds of the transaction in the partner’s bank account rather than the lessee’s account. The provisions of N.D.C.C. § 10-19.1-53 authorizing the president of a corporation to sign and deliver contracts did not preclude a finding, as a matter of fact, that there were facts that should have placed the leasing company on notice, or at least on inquiry, that the partner had no actual authority to bind the airplane lessee to the lease agreement.

      The election or appointment of an individual as an officer or agent does not, of itself, create contract rights. However, a corporation may enter into a contract with an officer or agent. The resignation or removal of an officer or agent is without prejudice to any contractual rights or obligations. The fact that the contract may be for a term that is longer than the terms of the directors who authorized or approved the contract does not make the contract void or voidable.

       Consideration for the issuance of shares may be paid, in whole or in part, in money; in other property, tangible or intangible; or in labor or services actually performed for the corporation. When payment of the consideration for which shares are to be issued is received by the corporation, the shares are considered fully paid and nonassessable. Neither promissory notes nor future services constitute payment or part payment for shares of a corporation.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c10-19.1s10-19.1-63ol12">
       Subject to any restrictions in the articles, a corporation may, without any new or additional consideration, issue its own shares in exchange for or in conversion of its outstanding shares, or, subject to authorization of share dividends, divisions, and combinations according to section 10-19.1-61.1, issue its own shares pro rata to shareholders or the shareholders of one or more classes or series, to effectuate share dividends, divisions, or combinations. No shares of a class or series, shares of which are then outstanding, shall be issued to the holders of shares of another class or series, except in exchange for or in conversion of outstanding shares of the other class or series, unless the issuance is expressly provided for in the articles or is approved at a meeting by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares of the same class or series as the shares to be issued.

Unless otherwise required by the articles, the consideration may be less than the par value, if any, of the shares. Directors or shareholders who are present and entitled to vote, and who, intentionally or without reasonable investigation, fail to vote against approving an issue of shares for a consideration that is unfair to the corporation, or overvalue property received or to be received by the corporation as consideration for shares issued, are jointly and severally liable to the corporation for the benefit of the then shareholders who did not consent to and are damaged by the action, to the extent of the damages of those shareholders. A director or shareholder against whom a claim is asserted pursuant to this subsection, except in case of knowing participation in a deliberate fraud, is entitled to contribution on an equitable basis from other directors or shareholders who are liable under this section.

         An appointment of a proxy for shares held jointly by two or more shareholders is valid if signed or consented to by authenticated electronic communication by any one of the shareholders, unless the corporation receives from any of those shareholders written notice or authenticated electronic communication either denying the authority of that person to appoint a proxy or appointing a different proxy.

        Alleged agreement relating to a corporation fell under the scope of N.D.C.C. § 9-06-04(1) because it could not have been performed within one year, and partial performance did not save the agreement; there was no conduct or action of the parties prior to the corporation’s dissolution that was inconsistent with closely held corporations and passive shareholders. The acceptance of a share of the profits of a corporation, although providing no work, was entirely consistent with the benefits routinely afforded to a passive shareholder.

        Although the shareholders alleged in their answer and counterclaim that the corporation acted fraudulently, they did not argue on appeal that they raised a genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment dismissal of this claim; thus, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 10-19.1-87(4) the district court did not err in ruling the shareholders had no other remedy available to them to receive the fair value of their preferred shares.

       Where corporation’s assets consisted largely of some inventory and buildings and equipment used in the business, there was a limited market in the corporate stock but sufficient to furnish a basis for reconstruction of market value, and corporation had shown losses for several years but had potential for profits under better management, “fair value” of shares would be determined on trial de novo by weighing asset value at fifty percent, market value at twenty-five percent and value based on earnings at twenty-five percent.

The petition shall be filed in the county in which the registered office of the corporation is located, except that a surviving foreign corporation that receives a demand relating to the shares of a constituent corporation shall file the petition in the county in this state in which the last registered office of the constituent corporation was located. The petition shall name as parties all dissenters who have demanded payment under subsection 9 and who have not reached agreement with the corporation. The corporation, after filing the petition, shall serve all parties with a summons and copy of the petition under the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. The residents of this state may be served by registered mail or by publication as provided by law. Except as otherwise provided, the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure apply to the proceeding.

The fair value of the shares as determined by the court is binding on all shareholders, wherever located. A dissenter is entitled to judgment for the amount by which the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, plus interest, exceeds the amount, if any, remitted under subsections 6, 7, and 8, but shall not be liable to the corporation for the amount, if any, by which the amount, if any, remitted to the dissenter under subsections 6, 7, and 8 exceeds the fair value of the shares as determined by the court, plus interest.

       This section permits a corporation to guarantee or pledge its assets if it obtains the approval of its board of directors; however, it does not prescribe remedies or explicitly state that an assignment lacking board approval is void per se. 277 F. Supp. 2d 1040.

      <p>
       District court properly granted summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 in favor of the United States in a taxpayer’s action seeking a refund of taxes paid in response to the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) assessment of a tax underpayment under 26 USCS § 72(p)(1); although the taxpayer claimed that a collateral assignment of annuity contracts was void because it was never authorized by the board of directors of the taxpayer’s corporation, as required under N.D.C.C § 10-19.1-89(1), the IRS properly treated the assignment as a taxable event based on the realities of the transaction. The contract was never voided through appropriate action by the corporation, and the taxpayer enjoyed the benefits of using the assignment as collateral for a loan. 366 F.3d 622.

        Alleged agreement relating to a corporation fell under the scope of N.D.C.C. § 9-06-04(1) because it could not have been performed within one year, and partial performance did not save the agreement; there was no conduct or action of the parties prior to the corporation’s dissolution that was inconsistent with closely held corporations and passive shareholders. The acceptance of a share of the profits of a corporation, although providing no work, was entirely consistent with the benefits routinely afforded to a passive shareholder.

        Although the shareholder argued that the prohibition on payment of further dividends should not be given effect because no purchase agreement was prepared as called for by the December 28, 2001, offer and because the closing was delayed beyond the contemplated closing date of the end of March 2002, the shareholder accepted payment for his shares of stock when the sale was finally closed on September 12, 2002; a party who accepts performance in a manner different from that required by contract acquiesces in any nonconforming performance.

        Attorney’s fees were properly awarded in a shareholder derivative action under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t10c10-19.1s10-19.1-85" target="_self">10-19.1-85.</a></cite>1, 10-19.1-115(6) because the district court found that the controlling shareholder had violated many of his fiduciary duties and had acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or otherwise not in good faith. The district court’s findings, in which it considered the lodestar method as well as the factors provided by N.D.R. Prof Conduct 1.5(a), supported the reasonableness of the award.

        Where plaintiff dissident shareholder of close corporation had been terminated from employment by the corporation and sought relief under N.D.C.C. § 10-19.1-115, plaintiff had not bargained away corporation’s duty of loyalty and good faith to her by signing a buy-sell agreement contemplating the involuntary termination of employee shareholders of the corporation and her reasonable expectations under the agreement as to continued employment had to be considered in determining whether she was entitled to relief. Because the trial court failed to make any findings as to whether the shareholders acted in a manner unfairly prejudicial to plaintiff, remand was necessary for further fact-finding and a determination of relief under N.D.C.C. ch. 10-19.1.

        Trial court did not err in finding a breach of fiduciary duties and ordering a buyout of minority shareholders’

        The following functions, assigned by court to a monitor, were not those of a receiver: acting as a conduit during litigation by obtaining monthly reports from defendant bank about salaries, bonuses, expenditures, or loan write-offs in favor of bank’s shareholders, officers, or directors; attending meetings of board of directors; receiving minutes of those meetings; forwarding all information and reports received from bank to court and to all counsel.

        Court monitor, appointed by trial court to observe and report actions of defendant bank during litigation, was not a “receiver” within North Dakota law, because monitor did not take possession of any fund or property which was subject of litigation. Therefore, statutes applicable to receivers were inapplicable. Vorachek v. Citizens State Bank, 461 N.W.2d 580, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       Where foreign manufacturer’s only contact with North Dakota was sale of its products through independent retailers, and manufacturer didn’t maintain an office in the state, had no employees in the state, and exercised no control over the retailers which sold its products, the corporation was not, under N.D.C.C. 10-22-01 (repealed), “transacting business” in the state.

       Foreign corporation’s employment of attorney to collect account from debtor and commencement of litigation against debtor in North Dakota together with attempted service of process by attachment of personal property in North Dakota did not constitute “doing business” in state so that no jurisdiction over foreign corporation was acquired by serving process on attorney in debtor’s conversion action premised on corporation’s sale of his property under attachment order.

       It is the purpose of this chapter to create a statewide nonprofit development corporation that will have the authority to take equity positions in, to provide loans to, or to use other innovative financing mechanisms to provide capital for new or expanding businesses in this state, or relocating businesses to this state. The corporation’s principal mission is the development and expansion of primary sector business in this state. The corporation may form additional corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, or other forms of business associations in order to further its mission of primary sector economic development.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c10-30.5s10-30.5-02ol12">
       The exclusive focus of this corporation is business development in this state; however, it is not excluded from participation with other states or organizations in projects that have a clear economic benefit to state residents in the creation of jobs or secondary business. Emphasis should be to develop jobs that provide an income adequate to support a family above the poverty level.

      <li id="t10c10-30.5s10-30.5-02ol13">
       Moneys in the development fund may be used to provide working capital or for financing the purchase of fixed assets but not to refinance existing debt. Moneys may also be used to make matching grants to county-authorized or city-authorized development corporations for the acquisition, leasing, or remodeling of real estate facilities for locating a prospective new primary sector business. A grant must be made as part of a package of financing in which the state is a participant.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c10-30.5s10-30.5-02ol14">
       The commissioner of commerce shall adopt rules, subject to the approval of the board of directors, necessary to implement the administration of the fund. The rules to implement the grant program must be developed to encourage local fundraising initiatives for developing locations for businesses financed by the corporation.

      <li id="t10c10-30.5s10-30.5-02ol15">
       Moneys in the development fund may be used to provide financing to early childhood facilities licensed under chapter 50-11.1. Moneys also may be used to make grants or loans to match grants or loans made by county-authorized or city-authorized development corporations, job development authorities created under chapter 11-11.1 or 40-57.4, and regional planning councils for acquiring, leasing, or remodeling of real estate facilities or for acquiring equipment for establishing or expanding a licensed early childhood facility. In providing financing under this subsection, the corporation shall ensure funds are distributed fairly among for-profit early childhood facilities, nonprofit early childhood facilities, and public early childhood facilities. An award under this subsection may not exceed one hundred thousand dollars per award.

         Once elected, a governor holds office for the term for which the governor was elected and until a successor is elected, or until the earlier death, resignation, disqualification, or removal of the governor.

         A majority of the governors currently holding office is a quorum for the transaction of business. When a quorum is present at a duly called or held meeting of the board, the vote of a majority of the directors present constitutes an act of the board.

The written action is effective when signed by the required number of governors, unless a different effective time is provided in the written action. When written action is permitted to be taken by less than all governors, then all governors must be notified immediately of its text and effective date. Failure to provide the notice does not invalidate the written action. A governor who does not sign or consent to the written action has no liability for the action or actions taken by the written action.

      <p>
       LLC operating agreement did not create an obligation for members to cover company expenditures. Thus, a claim that a dissociated member was obligated to pay a share of company rent, operating expenses, and employee salary failed. Bismarck Fin. Grp., LLC v. Caldwell, 2020 ND 207, 950 N.W.2d 155, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       Because the LLC members had no obligation under the agreement to contribute capital to cover company deficits, the dissociation of one member did not cause the remaining members injury in the form of increased contribution obligations. Each member’s proportionate obligation to contribute capital remained the same, i.e., there was none. Bismarck Fin. Grp., LLC v. Caldwell, 2020 ND 207, 950 N.W.2d 155, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Dissociated Member Not Obligated.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       LLC operating agreement did not create an obligation for members to cover company expenditures. Thus, a claim that a dissociated member was obligated to pay a share of company rent, operating expenses, and employee salary failed. Bismarck Fin. Grp., LLC v. Caldwell, 2020 ND 207, 950 N.W.2d 155, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the LLC members had no obligation under the agreement to contribute capital to cover company deficits, the dissociation of one member did not cause the remaining members injury in the form of increased contribution obligations. Each member’s proportionate obligation to contribute capital remained the same, i.e., there was none. Bismarck Fin. Grp., LLC v. Caldwell, 2020 ND 207, 950 N.W.2d 155, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

The foreign limited liability company must be enjoined from transacting business in this state until all civil penalties plus any interest and court costs that the court may assess have been paid and until the foreign limited liability company has otherwise complied with the provisions of this chapter.

        Intervention.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a corporation’s interest in an appeal of an order reinstating a foreign limited liability company (LLC) was tangential and collateral, the district court did not err in denying its motion to intervene as a matter of right; while the corporation had a direct interest in the action for reinstatement, that interest was not sufficiently direct for it to intervene as of right in the statutory appeal because it did not purport to have an ownership interest in or to be a member of the LLC. Manning v. Jaeger, 2021 ND 162, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Actions for reinstatement involve only the company seeking reinstatement, and the Secretary of State’s Office, and the statute is clear regarding the process a company must undergo when seeking that reinstatement; that the reinstatement may impact other legal matters is not one of the factors the district court considers in reviewing the filings to ensure they are in compliance with the statute. Manning v. Jaeger, 2021 ND 162, 964 N.W.2d 522, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 2021).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme court declined to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction and direct the district court to vacate a reinstatement order because issues of vital concern regarding matters of important public interest are not present in the case; a corporation’s motion to intervene was primarily based upon an alleged defense to a foreign limited liability company’s counterclaim in the separate action. Manning v. Jaeger, 2021 ND 162, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 2021).

    Member action without a meeting.

      An action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the members may be taken without a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the members entitled to vote on that action.

       If the articles so provide, any action may be taken by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the members who hold voting power equal to the voting power that would be required to take the same action at a meeting of the members at which all members were present. However, in no event may written action be taken by members who hold less than a majority of the voting power of all members entitled to vote on that action.

      Within ninety days of receipt of the written notice required under section 10-33-144, and such other additional extension of time permitted or provided under section 10-33-144, the attorney general shall notify, in writing, the nonprofit corporation or entity operating or controlling a hospital or nursing home of the attorney general’s decision to approve, deny, or take any other action on the proposed agreement or transaction. Before issuing a written decision under this section, the attorney general may conduct one or more public hearings, one of which must be held in the county where the hospital or nursing home is located. At a public hearing under this section, the attorney general shall request and receive comments from any interested person regarding the proposed agreement or transaction. At least fourteen days before a public hearing under this section, the attorney general shall provide notice of the meeting by publication in the official newspaper of the city in which the hospital or nursing home is located. The attorney general shall also provide notice of the meeting to the governing body of the county in which the hospital or nursing home is located, if applicable, and to the governing body of the city in which the hospital or nursing home is located, if applicable. Any party to the agreement may institute legal proceedings in the district court of the county in which the hospital or nursing home is located to review the attorney general’s decision. In a district court action brought under this section, the attorney general’s decision is subject to de novo review by the court. In a proceeding under this section, the attorney general must be served with notice and is entitled to be heard. If the attorney general substantially prevails in a proceeding under this section, the attorney general is entitled to an award of attorney’s fees, investigation fees, costs, and expenses of any investigation and proceeding under this section. The court shall award attorney’s fees to the attorney general under this section based upon the hourly rates the attorney general charges to state agencies for the attorney general’s legal services. A court may not apply the limitation on the rate of the attorney general’s attorney’s fees under this section as a limitation on an award of attorney’s fees to the attorney general under any other section.

      The attorney general may bring proceedings to secure compliance with sections 10-33-144 through 10-33-149 in the district court of the county in which the hospital or nursing home is located. If the attorney general determines consummation of the proposed transaction or agreement is not consistent with the fiduciary obligations of the nonprofit corporation or entity operating or controlling a hospital or nursing home and the corporation’s officers and directors, or is not in accordance with law, the attorney general may bring proceedings in the district court of the county in which the hospital or nursing home is located to enjoin the consummation of the proposed transaction or agreement or to secure any other relief available under the law. In a district court action brought under this section, the attorney general’s decision is subject to de novo review by the court.

       “Commission” means the United States securities and exchange commission.

       “Poison pill” means a security created or issued by a publicly traded corporation that precludes or limits a person or group of persons from owning beneficially or of record, or from exercising, converting, transferring, or receiving, the security on the same terms as other shareholders or which is intended to have the effect of diluting disproportionately from the shareholders generally the interest of the person or group of persons in the corporation or a successor to the corporation or otherwise discouraging the person or group of persons from acquiring beneficial ownership of shares of the corporation or a successor to the corporation. For the purposes of this subsection:
       <ol type="a">

        <li id="t10c10-35s10-35-02ol15c">
         A security is not a poison pill if it would otherwise be a poison pill solely because it contains restrictions on ownership or acquisition of shares of the corporation that are necessary:
