      Subject to the provisions of section 15-03-05, the board of university and school lands shall apply the prudent investor rule in investing the permanent funds under its control. The “prudent investor rule” means that in making investments the board shall exercise the same judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing and limitations of North Dakota and federal law, that an institutional investor of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercises in the management of large investments entrusted to it, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of funds, considering probable safety of capital as well as probable investment returns. Notwithstanding any investments made before July 1, 1997, the board may not use any funds entrusted to it to purchase, as sole owner, commercial or residential real property in North Dakota without prior approval of the legislative assembly or the budget section if the legislative assembly is not in session. Any request considered by the budget section must comply with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.54.html#t54c54-35s54-35-02" target="_blank">54-35-02.</a></cite>9. The board may also lend securities held by the permanent funds, including the authority to pledge a security interest in the securities in the possession of a custodian agent. These securities must be collateralized as directed by the board.

     <p>
      There is hereby created in the Bank of North Dakota a loan pool account. The board of university and school lands may purchase first mortgage farm loans made in accordance with this chapter from the Bank of North Dakota. All purchased farm loans must be managed and serviced by the Bank of North Dakota. The loans must be credited to the loan pool account and the investments, repayments, interest, and income must be credited to the various land department trust funds in the proportion that each participates therein. The loan pool account shall consist of current loans whenever possible. The board may authorize the Bank of North Dakota to renegotiate the mortgages in the loan pool account, including debt restructuring and reamortization, so long as the renegotiation is consistent with sound banking practices and the rules, regulations, and guidelines of the board. In the event foreclosures are necessary, the Bank of North Dakota shall handle foreclosures in accordance with standard banking practices and proceeds must be properly credited to the loan pool account and income accounts. The Bank of North Dakota shall charge such fee for the management of each loan as the Bank of North Dakota and the board of university and school lands shall agree. Such fee may only be deducted from interest payments received on loans. Loans purchased by the board of university and school lands may have originated in the Bank of North Dakota or other financial institutions. The Bank of North Dakota shall certify that all loans purchased by the board of university and school lands are first mortgages and that there are no prior judgments, mortgages, liens, or other encumbrances against the security for such first mortgages.

    Conveyance of mortgaged land to state — Effect.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a mortgage held by the state as security for the investment of permanent school funds of the state is in default and the foreclosure thereof is deemed advisable, the Bank of North Dakota, acting on behalf of the board of university and school lands, may accept from the owner of the record title of the land covered by the mortgage a deed conveying the land to the state. Such deed transfers and extinguishes all title, interest, and right of redemption of the grantor but does not extinguish the mortgage lien on the land. Such lien may be foreclosed subsequently in the manner provided by law. The deed may be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county wherein the land is situated, and the mortgage held by the state may be released and satisfied. A deed of conveyance from the date of its execution has the same legal effect for all purposes as a sheriff’s deed would have if the mortgage involved had been foreclosed.

        The statute permitting the board of university and school lands to take the deed of an insolvent mortgagor in lieu of foreclosure, but providing that such deed shall not extinguish the lien of such mortgage held by the board, evidences a legislative intent that a deed so taken affects only the title of the grantor, and does not affect the right, estate, or lien of third persons subsequent to the mortgage held by the board. State v. Sheridan County, 72 N.D. 254, 6 N.W.2d 51, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under a provision in the statute authorizing the state to accept a deed from the record titleholder in lieu of foreclosure of a state mortgage and providing that such deed does not extinguish the mortgage lien, the deed to the state does not create a merger of title. State v. Griggs County, 72 N.D. 587, 10 N.W.2d 245, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1943).

       <p>
        Where the state secured a deed from the mortgagor after he had conveyed property to the bank and secured a deed from the bank after the county acquired a tax deed, both deeds were ineffective under the statute authorizing the state to acquire a deed from the record titleholder in lieu of the foreclosure of the mortgage securing the investment of the permanent school fund. State v. Griggs County, 72 N.D. 587, 10 N.W.2d 245, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1943).

All lands to be leased or offered for lease within the respective counties must be advertised for lease by the board by publication once each week for a period of three weeks prior to the day of leasing in the official county newspaper where said land is situated and in such other newspapers as the board deems appropriate. A list of the lands to be offered for leasing must be filed with the county treasurer of the county wherein such lands are situated at least ten days prior to the day of leasing. If, in the opinion of the board, the land that will be leased in any county will not be sufficient to warrant the expense of advertisement in a newspaper by description of each tract or parcel, the notice may be given by general advertisement.

    Coal lands or coal in tracts — Leases — Term.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of university and school lands may lease any lands or coal in tracts that may be contained in lands sold with a reservation of coal deposits under its control for coal mining purposes. Any lease made under this chapter must be for a period of time as the board may determine. Lands or coal in tracts that may be contained in lands sold with a reservation of coal deposits must be leased for coal mining purposes for a royalty upon the coal as the board may deem fair and in the best interest of the state. The royalty applies only to coal actually mined and saved from the leased premises. If the board owns or controls a smaller interest than the entire and undivided coal estate, the royalty must be paid to it only in proportion to which its interest bears to the entire undivided fee. The board may lease land or coal in tracts for the purpose of prospecting for and mining coal for an annual rental of not less than one dollar per acre [.40 hectare] per year. The rental paid for any year may not be deducted from the royalties as they accrue. The board may adjust the royalty of existing coal leases as the board determines fair and in the best interest of the state.

      <li id="t15c15-05s15-05-10ol11">
       Oil and gas leases must be made by the board of university and school lands at such annual minimum payments as are determined by the board, but the royalty may not be less than twelve and one-half percent of the gross output of oil from the lands leased. Oil and gas leases made by the board may authorize a royalty of less than twelve and one-half percent for production from stripper well properties or individual stripper wells and qualifying secondary recovery and qualifying tertiary recovery projects as defined in section 57-51.1-01. Leases issued by the board under section 15-05-09 for products other than oil and gas must provide for adequate rental payments and other provisions as determined by the board.
      </li>

       The obligation arising under an oil and gas lease to pay oil or gas royalties to the board of university and school lands, to deliver oil or gas to a purchaser to the credit of the board, or to pay the market value thereof is of the essence in the lease contract, and breach of the obligation may constitute grounds for the cancellation of the lease in any case in which it is determined by the court that the equities of the case require cancellation. If the lessee or the lessee’s representative or assignee under an oil and gas lease fails to pay oil or gas royalties to the board within the time prescribed by administrative rule and cancellation of the lease is not sought, the lessee or the lessee’s representative or assignee thereafter shall pay interest on the unpaid royalties at a rate of three-quarters of one percent per month, not to exceed nine percent per annum. The commissioner may waive all or a portion of the interest under this subsection for good cause.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c15-05s15-05-10ol13">
       If a lessee or the lessee’s representative or assignee fails to respond or refuses to file an amended royalty statement and pay the royalty owed within ninety days of receiving written notice by mail of an underpayment, as provided by rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure, the board may impose a penalty of one-half percent per month, not to exceed six percent per annum. A party is deemed to have failed to respond if the party has not responded within ninety days of receipt of the written notice, or the party in response to the notice affirmatively indicates the intent not to pay the royalty or amounts due. The commissioner may waive all or a portion of the interest under this subsection for good cause.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c15-05s15-05-10ol14">
       If a lessee or the lessee’s representative or assignee disputes a royalty assessment or demand by the board, the lessee or the lessee’s representative or assignee may tender full payment of the disputed amount under protest any time after an assessment or demand is made by the board. Upon payment of the disputed amount under protest, all interest and penalties must cease to accrue. If it is determined that the payment of the disputed amount resulted in an overpayment, the party that made the payment is entitled to a refund of the overpayment amount plus interest at the rate established under section 28-20-34.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c15-05s15-05-10ol15">
       If a lessee or the lessee’s representative or assignee fails or refuses to comply with demands by the board to pay royalties, interest, or penalties under this chapter, the board may file an action to cancel the lease, recover unpaid royalties, and recover interest and penalties on the unpaid royalties. Notwithstanding chapter 28-01, an action under this subsection must be commenced within seven years of the date oil or gas was produced under a lease. An action to cancel a lease, recover unpaid royalties, or recover interest or penalties on unpaid royalties may not be filed for production that occurred under a lease before August 1, 2013.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The term “original grant lands” means all of the public lands which heretofore have been or hereafter may be granted to the state by the United States for the support and maintenance of the common schools or for the support and maintenance of the university, the school of mines, the North Dakota youth correctional center, North Dakota state university, the school for the deaf, any normal school, or any other educational, penal, or charitable institution, and any lands which have been obtained by the state through a trade of any such lands for other lands. Original grant lands which have been sold on contract retain their character as such grant lands until the contract has been paid up and a patent issued therefor.

       <p>
        The time period for adverse possession or acquiescence may commence to run against a purchaser of original grant lands anytime after the contract for sale is entered into, where the action to establish acquiescence comes after the contract for deed is fully paid. Cook v. Clark, 375 N.W.2d 181, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 410</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The doctrine of acquiescence may be applied to determine boundaries of “original grant” school lands held by patent from the state of North Dakota less than twenty years, although purchased from the state by contract for deed more than twenty years prior to the action to establish acquiescence. Cook v. Clark, 375 N.W.2d 181, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 410</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Enactment of this section and its predecessor, section 15-0601, R.C. (1943), did not overrule the decision in School Dist. v. Hefta, (1917) 35 N.D. 637, 160 N.W. 1005. The rationale of Hefta, distinguishing between public property and private property interests as they may be affected by inaction, is as valid today as it was in 1917. Cook v.

Leases may be renewed at the discretion of the board. When nongrant lands are leased without advertisement or competitive bidding, the board shall determine the rental by taking into consideration the nature and adaptability of the lands and the improvements thereon.

       <p>
        The decision, reached by the board in passing upon the validity of a contract for the sale of school lands, that such lands were not “coal lands” and therefore legally subject to sale is, in the absence of fraud or other evidence impugning the good faith of the board, final and the title thereafter conveyed by a patent issued to the purchaser of such lands may not be defeated by a subsequent discovery of a coal deposit therein.

     <p>
      An assignee of a bona fide purchaser of any of the lands mentioned in this title is subject to and governed by the provisions of this chapter applicable to the purchaser of whom the person is an assignee, and has the same rights in all respects as an original purchaser of the same class of lands. When the interest of a purchaser of any such lands is levied upon or attached in an action brought to recover a debt due from the purchaser, and when such interest is sold under execution and a certificate of sale is issued by the sheriff, the holder of the sheriff’s certificate, after the expiration of one year from the date of sale, may obtain and present to the commissioner of university and school lands a certificate of the sheriff of the county in which the land is situated, setting forth:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t15c15-08s15-08-08ol11">
       That the sale has been made;

      </li>
      <li id="t15c15-08s15-08-08ol15">
       That no claim of homestead exemption has been made as to the land by any person.

     </ol>
     <p>
      After the filing of such certificate in the office of the commissioner of university and school lands, the person who bought the interest of the purchaser of the land at such judicial sale is subrogated to the contract of the original purchaser and to all rights of the purchaser in and to the land. The person so subrogated may carry out and perform the contract of purchase with the state in all particulars and on full performance thereof the person shall receive a conveyance of the land from the state.

      If the annual interest or any installment of the purchase price is not paid within thirty days after the same becomes due under the provisions of any contract for sale, or if the taxes are not paid upon the lands described in said contract in accordance with the provisions of the contract, the contract is voidable from the time of any such default. The board of university and school lands, in the case of any voidable contract, may declare the contract canceled by a resolution adopted for that purpose. Upon such declaration of cancellation, the board shall notify the holder of the contract by a written notice mailed to the holder’s post-office address as shown by its records and shall cause a certified copy of such resolution to be forwarded to the county auditor. A certified copy of the resolution may be recorded in the office of the recorder. The resolution operates as a complete and final cancellation of the contract without any order or decree of a court except that the purchaser’s rights and liabilities continue until the expiration of the period of redemption. Upon the expiration of the period of redemption after cancellation of any such contract, the board shall order the commissioner to take possession of the land described in the contract and serve notice of the expiration of the period of redemption upon the purchaser and the county auditor. When a contract has been canceled and not redeemed, the land described therein may not be listed thereafter for taxation until it has been resold.

        There is no statutory provision for avoiding a patent issued after an approval and confirmation of the contract of sale. State v. Oster, 61 N.W.2d 276, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Prior to the issuance of patents the board is required three times to pass upon the question of whether lands are legally subject to sale, first, when it selects the lands to be offered for sale; second, when it approves the contracts of sale; and third, when it directs the issuance of patents. State v. Oster, 61 N.W.2d 276, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1953).

       <p>
        District court did not err in granting the sellers summary judgment where they reserved equitable title to 50 percent of the minerals in a warranty deed conveying the surface in the subject land grant property to the purchaser, and upon full payment and issuance of a patent to the purchaser, the sellers' remaining equitable interest ripened into full legal title relating back to the date of the contract for sale.

The county may assign its rights and interest at any time, and the assignee shall have the rights given by this section to the county. No tax deed may be issued upon any tax sale certificate while the legal title to the lands remains in the state of North Dakota.

      The lessee of any lands under the control of the board of university and school lands, within one hundred twenty days after the expiration date or cancellation date of a lease may remove any nonpermanent improvements placed upon the lands by the lessee if the removal can be accomplished without material damage to the land. Permanent improvements may not be placed on the land without written consent of the commissioner of university and school lands. A lessee requesting a permit to place permanent improvements on the land shall complete an application form prepared by the commissioner. The cost of completing the permanent improvement is the lessee’s expense. The commissioner may approve depreciation of all or a portion of the cost of the permanent improvement over a period not to exceed ten years. The commissioner may also require the lessee to submit all documentation deemed necessary by the commissioner to determine the cost. The cost may not include any reimbursements to the lessee. The next lessee or purchaser, in addition to paying the purchase price or rental of the land, shall pay to the preceding lessee the undepreciated cost, if any. The commissioner may cancel any undepreciated cost of constructing a permanent improvement if the lessee fails to offer the minimum bid for the land and the land is not leased at the next auction at which the land is offered or if the lessee fails to comply with the conditions of the lease agreement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Permanent improvements placed on the property must be deemed the property of the state. For purposes of this section, permanent improvements include buildings, wells, dams, waterholes, waterlines, and trees and nonpermanent improvements include fences, corrals, water tanks, and feed bunks.

      The board of university and school lands may sell the property described in the application to the applicant at a price not less than the appraised value if the board concludes that the land described in the application is required for the purposes stated in such application and that a conveyance of the property is consistent with this title and the fiduciary responsibilities of the board. If the land described in the application is less than an entire tract, the board, in fixing the price at which such partial tract will be conveyed, shall take its value into consideration together with all detriment caused to the remaining portions of the tract by the conveyance of the partial tract. If the applicant agrees to the price fixed by the board for the land described in the application and pays the full purchase price therefor, the board shall cause the tract to be conveyed to the applicant.

    Disagreement as to purchase price — Condemnation — Procedure — Fixing values.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the applicant is unwilling to pay the price for a conveyance fixed by the board of university and school lands, the applicant may maintain an action in the district court against the state to condemn the land under chapter 32-15. The amount awarded by the court or jury as damages for the taking of an entire tract, however, may not be less than the appraised value thereof, and the board, court, or jury, in fixing the amount to be paid for an entire tract or a part thereof, shall take into consideration the appraised value of the land, its actual value for all ordinary purposes, and any increased value it may have for any special and unusual purpose by reason of the existence of the facts authorizing the exercise of the power of eminent domain. If the land is desired for a gravel pit, its value may be estimated with reference to the existence of a demand for gravel, taking into consideration the necessities of the person seeking to acquire the land. If the land is desired for townsite purposes, consideration must be given to the value of the land to the state if it were used by the state for that purpose, and consideration also must be given to the necessity for a townsite at the place in question warranting the exercise of the power of eminent domain for that purpose. If the land is desired for other purposes, similar elements of value must be considered.

Therefore, the settlement agreement, when construed as a whole, did not delegate to two Indian tribes the ultimate authority to determine usage of the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo, or limit the Board’s authority to terminate the nickname and logo before November 30, 2010.

      The state board of higher education may authorize campus improvements and building maintenance on land under the control of the board which are financed by donations, gifts, grants, and bequests if the cost of the improvement or building maintenance is not more than seven hundred thousand dollars. The consent of the legislative assembly is required for construction of any building or any addition to a building on land under the control of the board which is financed by donations, gifts, grants, and bequests. The consent of the legislative assembly is required for campus improvements or building maintenance financed by donations, gifts, grants, and bequests if the cost of the improvements or maintenance is more than seven hundred thousand dollars. During the time the legislative assembly is not in session, except for the six months preceding the convening of a regular session and the three months following the close of a regular session, and unless otherwise restricted by previous legislative action or other law, the budget section may authorize the use of land under the control of the board and construct buildings financed by donations, gifts, grants, and bequests and campus improvements and building maintenance financed by donations, gifts, grants, and bequests if the cost of the improvement or maintenance is more than seven hundred thousand dollars. Any project request submitted to the budget section for the construction of a building financed by donations, gifts, grants, and bequests must include the removal of a building or buildings with an equivalent or greater total number of square feet compared to the proposed building. The budget section approval must comply with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.54.html#t54c54-35s54-35-02" target="_blank">54-35-02.</a></cite>9 and must include a specific dollar limit for each building, campus improvement project or maintenance project. The state board of higher education may authorize the sale of any real property or buildings which an institution of higher learning has received by gift or bequest. The board shall prescribe such conditions for the sale of the property as it determines necessary. The conditions must include requiring an appraisal and public auction or advertisement for bids, unless the gift instrument requires a different process. If the state board of higher education submits a request for campus improvements, building maintenance, or to construct buildings under this section to the budget section for approval, the legislative council shall notify each member of the legislative assembly of the date of the budget section meeting at which the request will be considered and provide a copy of the meeting agenda to each member of the legislative assembly. The chairman of the budget section shall allow any member of the legislative assembly an opportunity to present testimony to the budget section regarding any such request.

        Trial court’s interpretation of regulations to ascertain their purpose is a question of law which is fully reviewable by supreme court on appeal, whereas the determination whether university’s conduct was in substantial compliance with the regulations, i.e. whether their purpose has been effectuated, is a question of fact.

        As a tenured college instructor did not raise a genuine or material issue of fact showing a reasoning mind could not have concluded there was adequate cause to dismiss her, the trial court properly dismissed her breach of contract claim on summary judgment.

        Plain and unambiguous language of a settlement agreement between the State Board of Higher Education and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, when construed as a whole and in conjunction with the Board’s authority, did not require the Board or the University of North Dakota to continue using the “Fighting Sioux” nickname and logo until November 30, 2010. Therefore, the settlement agreement, when construed as a whole, did not delegate to two Indian tribes the ultimate authority to determine usage of the Fighting Sioux nickname and logo, or limit the Board’s authority to terminate the nickname and logo before November 30, 2010.

        To secure review of a decision by the State Board of Higher Education, a person adversely affected must bring a separate action in district court because there is no statute or rule providing an appeal to the district court similar to the appeal provided from administrative agency decisions; however, in light of the separation of powers doctrine, judicial review similar to that provided in appeals from administrative agency decisions is appropriate in a case where an instructor appeals from her dismissal for cause by the Peterson v.

      In order to make the most provident utilization of state institutions of higher education and private colleges in North Dakota, and public and private colleges and universities in contiguous states, and to avoid duplication of facilities, it is desirable to provide means which will enable a student resident within the areas served by such institutions of higher education to obtain desired courses in the most expedient manner and at the least possible cost.

      All postsecondary educational institutions must be accredited by national or regional accrediting agencies recognized by the United States department of education. The board may additionally require such further evidence and make such further investigation as in its judgment may be necessary. Any postsecondary educational institution operating in this state seeking its first authorization to operate may be issued a provisional authorization to operate on an annual basis until the institution becomes eligible for accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency. Institutions issued a provisional authorization to operate must demonstrate a substantial good-faith showing of progress toward such status. Only upon accreditation may an institution become eligible for a regular authorization to operate. An institution shall give written notification to the board within thirty days of any change to the institution’s accreditation status.

      A school district board may not proceed to obtain approval as a participating district in an area career and technology center if a petition for referendum of the question of said school district participating in an area career and technology center signed by twenty percent of the qualified electors of said school district voting at the last annual school election is filed with the school board within sixty days of the publication of the resolution provided for in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t15c15-20.2s15-20.2-12" target="_self">15-20.2-12.</a></cite> When such petition is filed, the school board may not obtain approval as a participating district in an area career and technology center until the question of whether the district shall enter into an area career and technology center has been submitted to the qualified electors of the district. If a majority of the total number of votes cast on the question within the school district is in favor of the question, the school board may proceed to obtain approval as a participating district in an area career and technology center.

     <p>
      The procedure for withdrawal is the same as for joining as provided for in sections 15-20.2-11 through 15-20.2-13, except that when a participating district is unable to obtain an approval of withdrawal from the center board, or the state board, or both, the participating district may submit the question to withdraw from the area career and technology center to the voters of the school district. If a majority of the total number of votes cast on the question is in favor of withdrawal, the participating school district must be released from the area career and technology center. Such withdrawal may become effective at the end of the next school year or on such a date as determined by the state board, but such withdrawal does not affect the liability of the withdrawing school district for obligations incurred during its participation.

       All postsecondary career schools must be accredited by national or regional accrediting agencies recognized by the United States department of education. The board may additionally require such further evidence and make such further investigation as in its judgment may be necessary. Any postsecondary career school operating in this state seeking its first authorization to operate may be issued a provisional authorization to operate on an annual basis until the school becomes eligible for accreditation by a recognized accrediting agency. Schools issued a provisional authorization to operate must demonstrate a substantial good-faith showing of progress toward such status. Only upon accreditation shall a school become eligible for a regular authorization to operate. A school shall give written notification to the board within thirty days of any change to the school’s accreditation status.

        A teacher who has attained the age, made the payments, and completed the service as required by the law is entitled to an annuity measured by the terms of the law in force when his teaching service terminates.

      Benefits with respect to a member participating under former chapter 15-39 or chapter 15-39.1 or 15-39.2 may not exceed the maximum benefits specified under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 415], as amended, for governmental plans. The maximum dollar benefit applicable under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code must reflect any increases in this amount provided under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. If a member’s benefit is limited by these provisions at the time of retirement or termination of employment, or in any subsequent year, the benefit paid in any following calendar year may be increased to reflect all cumulative increases in the maximum dollar limit provided under section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for years after the year employment terminated or payments commenced, but not to more than would have been payable in the absence of the limits under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. If an annuitant’s benefit is increased by a plan amendment, after the commencement of payments, the member’s benefit may not exceed the maximum dollar benefit under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted for the commencement age and form of payment, increased as provided by section 415(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. If this plan must be aggregated with another plan to determine the effect of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code on a member’s benefit, and if the benefit must be reduced to comply with section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, then the reduction must be made pro rata between the two plans, in proportion to the member’s service in each plan.

       A “qualified domestic relations order” for purposes of this section means any judgment, decree, or order, including approval of a property settlement agreement, which relates to the provision of child support, spousal support, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of the teacher, which is made pursuant to a North Dakota domestic relations law, and which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee’s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a part of the benefits payable to the teacher. A qualified domestic relations order may not require the board to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the fund, or to provide increased benefits as determined on the basis of actuarial value. However, a qualified domestic relations order may require the payment of benefits at the early retirement date notwithstanding that the teacher has not terminated eligible employment.

     <p>
      A teacher who has withdrawn from the fund as set forth in this chapter may, by returning to teach in a public school or state institution of this state, regain service credit for prior teaching by making the required payment. The required payment, if made within five years of returning to teach in covered employment, is the amount that was withdrawn with interest. In all other cases, the purchase cost must be on an actuarial equivalent basis. If the teacher returns to teach in covered employment after June 30, 2008, the teacher becomes a tier two member regardless of whether the teacher repurchases service credit earned while the teacher was a tier one member.

    Option of teachers eligible to receive annuities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board shall adopt rules providing for the receipt of retirement benefits in the following optional forms:
     </p>
     <p>
      Option one. Upon the death of the teacher, the reduced retirement allowance must be continued throughout the life of, and paid to, the teacher’s designated beneficiary named at the time of retirement. If the person designated to receive the teacher’s reduced retirement allowance predeceases the teacher, the reduced retirement allowance must be converted to a single life retirement annuity under which benefit payments, if the person designated died prior to July 1, 1989, must begin on July 1, 1989, or, if the person designated dies on or after July 1, 1989, must begin on the first day of the month following the death of the person designated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Option two. Upon the death of the teacher, one-half of the reduced retirement allowance must be continued throughout the life of, and paid to, the teacher’s designated beneficiary named at the time of retirement. If the person designated to receive the teacher’s reduced retirement allowance predeceases the teacher, the reduced retirement allowance must be converted to a single life retirement annuity under which benefit payments, if the person designated died prior to July 1, 1989, must begin on July 1, 1989, or, if the designated beneficiary dies on or after July 1, 1989, must begin on the first day of the month following the death of the person designated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Option three. Upon the death of the teacher within twenty years of the commencement of annuity payments, the payments must be continued for the remainder of the twenty-year period to the teacher’s designated beneficiary. This payment option is available to teachers who retire after July 31, 2003.
     </p>
     <p>
      Option four. Upon the death of the teacher within ten years of the commencement of annuity payments, the payments must be continued for the remainder of the ten-year period to the teacher’s designated beneficiary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Option five. Level retirement income with social security option, which is available to teachers retiring before social security is payable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Option six. Partial lump sum distribution option. A member who is eligible for an unreduced service retirement annuity under section 15-39.1-10 and who retires after July 31, 2003, may make a one-time election to receive a portion of the retirement annuity paid in a lump sum distribution upon retirement, pursuant to rules adopted by the board.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t15c15-39.1s15-39.1-16ol11">
       The eligible member may select a standard service retirement annuity or an optional service retirement annuity described in this section, together with a partial lump sum distribution. The partial lump sum distribution option is not available to members who have selected option five, the level income retirement option. This option is not available to disabled members or beneficiaries of deceased members. The partial lump sum distribution option may be elected only once by a member and may not be elected by a retiree.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c15-39.1s15-39.1-16ol12">
       The amount of the partial lump sum distribution under this section is twelve months of a standard service retirement annuity computed under section 15-39.1-10 and payable at the same time that the first monthly payment of the annuity is paid.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c15-39.1s15-39.1-16ol13">
       The service retirement annuity selected by the member must be actuarially reduced to reflect the partial lump sum distribution option selected by the member.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c15-39.1s15-39.1-16ol14">
       Before a retiring member selects a partial lump sum distribution under this section, the fund shall provide a written notice to the member of the amount by which the member’s annuity will be reduced because of the selection.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The amount of the reduced retirement allowance payable upon the exercise of any of these options must be computed upon an actuarial basis through the use of standard actuarial tables and based upon the ages of the teacher and the teacher’s designated beneficiary. A member’s spouse, if designated as beneficiary, must consent in writing to the member’s choice of benefit payment option for any benefit payments commencing after June 30, 1999. The board may rely on the member’s representations about that person’s marital status in determining the member’s marital status. The spouse’s written consent must be witnessed by a notary or a plan representative. If the spouse does not consent, or cannot be located, the member’s annuity benefit must be paid using option two, the fifty percent joint and survivor option.

If a member dies without naming a contingent beneficiary, the primary beneficiary may name a contingent beneficiary.

     <p>
      When a member of the fund ceases to be eligible under the terms of this chapter to participate in the fund, the member may, after a period of one hundred twenty days, withdraw from the fund and is then entitled to receive a refund of assessments accumulated with interest. The one-hundred-twenty-day requirement may be waived by the board when it has evidence the teacher will not be returning to teach in North Dakota. The refund is in lieu of any other benefits to which the member may be entitled under the terms of this chapter, and by accepting the refund, the member is waiving any right to participate in the fund under the same provisions that existed at the time the refund was accepted regardless of whether the member later repurchases refunded service credit. A member or a beneficiary of a member may elect, at the time and under rules adopted by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly in a direct rollover to an eligible retirement plan specified by the member or the beneficiary to the extent permitted by section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended.

The penalty must be paid to the fund and deposited in the same manner as other receipts under this chapter.

      Notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 15-39.1, any person who retired from teaching under the teachers’ insurance and retirement fund prior to July 1, 1971, who had ten or more years of teaching credit under that program is entitled to elect to qualify for benefits under the teachers’ fund for retirement by complying with the provisions of this chapter. A college teacher who retired from teaching after July 1, 1971, may, notwithstanding the provisions of section 15-39.1-25, elect to receive benefits in accordance with chapter 15-39.1 and section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t15c15-39.2s15-39.2-05" target="_self">15-39.2-05.</a></cite> The amount of monthly benefits to which an annuitant electing to come under the 1971 law is entitled until death is equal to one and one-half percent of the monthly salary of the annuitant for the last school year for each year of service of that annuitant. Monthly salary within the meaning of this provision is deemed to be an amount equal to one-twelfth of the annual salary of the teacher. If for any reason the earnings of the teacher for the last year of teaching are shown to have been nonrepresentative of the teacher’s typical earnings, the board shall readjust the credit to be allowed for past years of service to the last year of typical earnings. As used in this section, “college teacher” means a retired teacher who is entitled to receive an annuity through the teachers’ insurance and annuity association of America — college retirement equities fund (TIAA-CREF) as a result of having participated in the North Dakota state board of higher education TIAA-CREF retirement plan for North Dakota state institutions of higher education.

      There is created in the state treasury the university system capital building fund. The university system capital building fund consists of moneys transferred to the fund and any interest and earnings of the fund. The state board of higher education may provide for the fund to be invested under the supervision of the state investment board. Moneys in the fund are appropriated to the state board of higher education on a continuing basis for allocations to the institutions under the control of the state board of higher education for capital projects as directed by the legislative assembly and in accordance with this chapter. Any interest or earnings of the fund must be allocated to the capital building fund pool within the university system capital building fund.

      Subject to tier II and tier III capital building fund matching requirements under this chapter, each institution may use its allocation of funds from the university system capital building fund for projects specifically authorized by the legislative assembly to use university system capital building fund moneys. In addition, after an institution has matched and committed seventy-five percent of the funding appropriated for the institution’s tier I extraordinary repairs and subject to state board of higher education approval and matching requirements under this chapter, each institution may use its allocation of funds from the university system capital building fund for extraordinary repairs and deferred maintenance projects that do not increase the overall square footage of a building. The state board of higher education shall report biennially to the legislative management and to the appropriations committees of the legislative assembly on the use of funding in the university system capital building fund, the source of matching funds, and each institution’s five-year plan for capital construction spending.

      For the purpose of paying all or part of, but not to exceed, the cost of construction, equipment, and furnishing of any such buildings or any addition to existing buildings, or other campus improvements, or in order to refund any outstanding bonds or interim financing issued for such purpose, the state board of higher education may borrow money on the credit of the income and revenue to be derived from the operation of the said building or buildings or other campus improvements, and, in anticipation of such collections of such income and revenues, may issue negotiable bonds in such an amount as, in the opinion of the board, may be necessary for such purposes, all within the limits of the authority granted by the legislative assembly in each instance, and may provide for the payment of such bonds and the rights of the holders thereof as provided in this chapter. The bonds may bear such date or dates; mature at such time or times not exceeding fifty years from their date; be in such denomination or denominations; be in such form, either coupon or registered; carry such registration and conversion privileges; be executed in such manner; be payable in such medium of payment at such place or places; be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium; bear such rate or rates of interest; and be subject to such other terms or conditions as may be provided by resolution or resolutions to be adopted by the board. The bonds may be sold in such manner and at such price or prices as may be considered by the board to be advisable. The average net interest cost to maturity for any bond issues sold at private sale may not exceed twelve percent per annum. There is no interest rate ceiling on those issues sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. Any grants agreed to be made by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof to reduce the interest cost of bonds, whether or not pledged to the payment of the bonds or interest thereon as part of the income and revenue to be derived from the operation of the buildings or improvements pledged to the payment of the issue, must be considered as a reduction in the interest costs of the bonds with respect to which the grant is made, for purposes of the rate limitations on interest costs provided herein. The bonds have all of the qualities and incidents of negotiable paper and are not subject to taxation by the state of North Dakota, or by any county, municipality, or political subdivision therein. The board, in its discretion, may authorize one issue of bonds hereunder for the construction, furnishing, and equipment of more than one building or other campus improvement and may make the bonds payable from the combined revenues of all buildings or other campus improvements acquired in whole or in part with the proceeds thereof, and when bonds are so issued, the words “the building”, as herein used, refers to all the buildings or other campus improvements so acquired.

    Refunding bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Bonds may be refunded, but no bonds may be refunded under this chapter unless the bonds either mature or are callable for prior redemption under their terms within thirty years from the date of issuance of the refunding bonds, or unless the holder or holders of the bonds voluntarily surrender them for exchange or payment. Outstanding bonds of more than one issue or series and bonds for refunding and other bonds to construct, furnish, or equip any building or addition or other campus improvement for which bonds are authorized may be combined into one issue or series and may provide for and restrict the combination of future series with the issue. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the bonds must have such details and must be authorized and issued in the manner provided in this chapter. Refunding bonds so issued may carry forward for the payment of the refunding bonds such security and sources of payment as were pledged to the payment of the bonds refunded, and a combined issue of refunding and other bonds may combine such security and sources of payment with a pledge of the revenues of buildings or other campus improvements acquired in whole or in part from the proceeds of the issue, including the security and sources of payment of any future series of refunding bonds or revenues of any building or other campus improvement acquired from the proceeds of a future series if and to the extent that provision is made for combination of future series with the issue. The word “building” as used in this section means all the buildings or other campus improvements the revenues of which are pledged. Any bonds issued for refunding purposes may be delivered in exchange for the outstanding bonds authorized to be refunded, sold at either public or private sale, or sold in part and exchanged in part. There is no interest rate ceiling on those issues issued solely for refunding purposes. The sale price may exceed the principal amount of refunding bonds and the excess may be used to provide for payment of redemption premiums of the bonds to be refunded and to provide for expenses of the issuance and sale of the bonds and the retirement of the outstanding bonds. All other proceeds of the sale must be, to the extent needed, immediately applied to the retirement of the bonds to be refunded, or the proceeds or investments thereof must be placed in escrow to be held and applied to the payment of the bonds to be refunded, or in the case of crossover refunding, must be invested in securities irrevocably appropriated to the payment of principal and interest on the refunding bonds until the date the proceeds are applied to the payment or redemption of the bonds to be refunded.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proceeds may, in the discretion or pursuant to covenant of the board, be invested in obligations of the United States of America, or in obligations fully guaranteed by the United States of America, but the obligations so purchased must have such maturities and bear such rates of interest payable at such times as will assure the existence of money sufficient to pay the bonds to be refunded when due or when redeemed pursuant to call for redemption, together with any interest and redemption premiums. The proceeds or obligations so purchased must be deposited in trust with the trustee for the refunded bonds, or with the banking corporation, association, or limited liability company which is the paying agent for the refunded bonds, or with the state treasurer, to be held, liquidated, and the proceeds of such liquidation paid out for the payment of the bonds to be refunded and interest and redemption premiums thereon as the refunded bonds become due or subject to redemption under call for redemption previously made, or upon earlier voluntary surrender thereof with the consent of the board. The determination of the board in issuing refunding bonds that the issuance and sale of refunding bonds is necessary for the best interests of the institution and that the limitations herein imposed upon the issuance of refunding bonds have been met is conclusive in the absence of fraud or arbitrary and gross abuse of discretion.

    Deposit and use of proceeds of bonds — Authorizing issuing of warrants — Contracts.

     <p>
      The proceeds from the sale of the bonds herein authorized must be deposited to the credit of the board and kept in a separate fund in the state treasury, in the Bank of North Dakota or in a bank which is a duly designated depository for state funds and is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation. Provided, that when such funds are deposited in a bank other than the Bank of North Dakota or a bank which is not a duly designated depository for state funds, such bank must be required to pledge, as security for such deposit, securities in an amount equal to the sum by which such deposit exceeds the amount of federal deposit insurance corporation insurance. Securities which are eligible for such pledge are notes or bonds issued by the United States government, its agencies or instrumentalities, all bonds and notes guaranteed by the United States government, federal land bank bonds, or bonds issued by any state of the United States. In lieu of the deposit of such securities, a surety bond may be accepted from the bank designated as a depository in a sum equal to the amount of funds such bank may receive in excess of the amount guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation. Such proceeds must be used solely for the purpose for which the bonds are authorized except that the board may invest such funds in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States of America, or obligations of the state of North Dakota or of any municipality as defined in section 21-03-01 prior to or during building or other campus improvement construction except to the extent such investment is prohibited or restricted by any covenant made with or for the benefit of bondholders. The board is authorized to make all contracts and to cause the execution of all instruments which in its discretion may be deemed necessary or advisable to provide for the construction, furnishing, and equipment of the building or other campus improvement or for the sale of the bonds or for interim financing deemed necessary or advisable pending the sale of the bonds and pledging the proceeds of the bonds.

    Interim financing.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board may provide for interim financing pending completion of revenue-producing projects at state institutions of higher learning and financing the cost thereof and may authorize the issuance and sale of special interim warrants for that essential governmental purpose, such warrants to be paid with interest from:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t15c15-55s15-55-05.3ol11">
       The proceeds of definitive bonds issued in accordance with this chapter;

       Warrants issued to refund outstanding warrants; or

       The combined net revenues to be derived from the operation of buildings and campus improvements for which bonds are outstanding with which the definitive bonds to be issued for such project will be on a parity.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The board shall arrange for the proper preparation and sale of the warrants and shall issue the warrants in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of bonds authorized and necessary to finance completion of the project. Interim warrants are subject to call and prepayment on thirty days’ prior written notice to the place of payment at par and accrued interest to date of prepayment at the option of the board; must mature not more than three years from their date; and may bear such rate or rates of interest as the board may provide, not exceeding an average net interest cost of twelve percent per annum on issues sold at private sale. There is no interest rate ceiling on warrant issues sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. Interim warrants may be sold on the basis of ninety-five percent of par plus accrued interest to date of delivery. All warrants for a particular project must mature within three years from the date of issuing the first warrants for the project. If warrants are issued to refund warrants, the refunded warrants must be paid and canceled upon the issuance of the refunding warrants, or the proceeds at the sale of the refunding warrants, excepting the accrued interest received, must be used to purchase direct obligations of the United States of America. Such obligations must mature at such time or times, with interest thereon or the proceeds received therefrom, to provide funds adequate to pay, when due or called for redemption prior to maturity, the warrants to be refunded together with the interest accrued thereon and any redemption premium due thereon. Such proceeds or obligations of the United States of America must, with all other funds legally available for such purpose, be deposited in escrow with a banking corporation or national banking association located in and doing business in the state of North Dakota, with power to accept and execute trusts, or any successor thereto, which is also a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation and of the federal reserve system. The proceeds or obligations are to be held in an irrevocable trust solely for and until the payment and redemption of the warrant to be refunded. Any balance remaining in escrow after the payment and retirement of the warrants to be refunded must be returned to the board to be used and held for use as revenues pledged for the payment of the definitive bonds. Interim warrants have all of the qualities and incidents of negotiable paper and are not subject to taxation by the state of North Dakota or by any county, municipality, or political subdivision therein. Interim warrants are eligible for investment of funds the same as definitive bonds are or would be eligible for investment under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t15c15-55s15-55-08" target="_self">15-55-08.</a></cite>
     </p>
     <p>
      Such warrants may not constitute a general obligation indebtedness of the state of North Dakota nor of the institution for which they are issued nor of the state board of higher education nor of the individual members, officers, or agents thereof; are payable solely as provided in this section; and the warrants issued and sold must so state.

The board may designate as a depository for such revenues and funds either the state treasury or the Bank of North Dakota or the trustee under the trust agreement for the bondholders or a bank which is a duly designated depository for state funds or as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t15c15-55s15-55-05" target="_self">15-55-05.</a></cite> The said board may, in its resolution authorizing the bonds or in the trust agreement or agreements executed and delivered by the board, provide for an expense fund to be retained by the collecting officer for the purpose of paying and may direct the collecting officer to pay the accrued or anticipated expenses of operation and maintenance of the building or campus improvement, and if the board so directs or if such expense fund is so provided, the collecting officer may pay such expenses as so directed by the board or from said fund. The funds required to be remitted to the state treasurer, if any, and any funds derived from revenues pledged to the bondholders must be held by the collecting officer or in the depository for such funds designated by the board in a special fund or funds, to be applied solely to the payment of the principal and interest on said bonds, and the establishment of a reserve for future payments until all of said bonds and interest thereon have been fully paid; provided, that to the extent not prohibited or restricted by any covenant made with or for the benefit of the bondholders, the board may invest any such funds in direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by, the United States of America, or obligations of the state of North Dakota or of any municipality as defined in section 21-03-01 and may devote revenues not currently required for payment of principal and interest, for the creation or maintenance of a debt service reserve, or for expenses of operation and maintenance to such purposes as the board from time to time may designate, including replacing the furnishings and equipment of such building or buildings or campus improvements and improving said building or buildings or campus improvements.

      All bonds issued under the provisions of this chapter must have endorsed thereon a statement to the effect that the same do not constitute an obligation of the state of North Dakota, the state board of higher education, nor the individual members, officers, or agents thereof, nor of the institution upon the campus of which the building or campus improvement is located, and that the said bonds are payable solely and only out of the revenues to be produced and received from the operation of said building or campus improvement. Such bonds must be submitted to the attorney general of North Dakota for examination and when such bonds have been examined and certified as legal obligations by the attorney general in accordance with such requirements as the attorney general may make, are incontestable in any court in this state unless suit thereon is brought in a court having jurisdiction thereof within thirty days from the date of such approval. Bonds so approved by the attorney general are prima facie valid and binding obligations according to their terms and the only defense which may be offered thereto in any suit instituted after such thirty-day period has expired is forgery, fraud, or violation of the constitution.

The legislative authorization may be aggregated and the appropriation of the proceeds of the bonds for the construction of the buildings or improvements are not subject to cancellation under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.54.html#t54c54-44.1s54-44.1-11" target="_blank">54-44.1-11.</a></cite> Authorization for the issuance of bonds by the legislative assembly expires four years after the effective date of the authorization unless bonds have been issued for the construction of buildings or improvements in the amounts so authorized or a contract for the design of the building has been signed by the state board of higher education before the expiration date or the authorization specifies a different expiration date. Refunding bonds may be issued by the state board of higher education under this chapter without legislative act to refund, at or before the maturity of or pursuant to any privilege of prepayment reserved in or granted with respect to, any bonds issued to pay the cost of buildings or other campus improvements designated and authorized by legislative act.

If at any time the agency determines that student loans made under the terms and conditions of federal coinsurance programs are no longer adequately serving the needs of North Dakota students attending postsecondary institutions, or if federal coinsurance is no longer available, the agency shall notify the industrial commission or its designee. Upon approval of the industrial commission or its designee, the agency shall guarantee student loans without federal coinsurance pursuant to rules made by the agency relating to terms for applicant eligibility in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Students whose loans are guaranteed by the agency must be students who have been accepted for enrollment in postsecondary training or are attending eligible postsecondary institutions located within or outside this state, and whose loans are for the purpose of assisting them in meeting their expenses of postsecondary education. Students who are accepted for enrollment or are attending eligible proprietary or postsecondary institutions of higher education are eligible to have loans guaranteed by the agency. The agency shall, by rule, establish minimum qualifications for a person to be deemed a part-time student for purposes of this chapter.

     <p>
      All loans guaranteed by the agency and coinsured by the federal government must bear interest at rates which are no greater than those provided under the federally coinsured loan programs. In the event that the agency guarantees student loans without federal coinsurance pursuant to section 15-62.1-02, the interest rate on such loans may be fixed or variable. Any prohibition on the capitalization of interest does not apply to loans guaranteed under this chapter. A loan guaranteed under this chapter may provide for interest which remains unpaid at the end of any period specified in the loan to be added to the principal amount of the debt and thereafter accumulate interest.

      The agency may enter into an agreement with the federal government for the coinsurance of loans guaranteed under this program. The agency shall establish and at all times maintain from funds appropriated under this chapter adequate guarantee reserve funds in special accounts in the Bank of North Dakota unless required by title IV, part B, of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [Pub. L. 89-329; 79 Stat. 1236; Pub. L. 99-498; 100 Stat. 1353; Pub. L. 105-244; 112 Stat. 1581; 20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], as amended through December 31, 1998, to be invested elsewhere. The fund for loans that are coinsured by the federal government must be maintained at a minimum amount equal to the requirements set forth in title IV, part B, of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [Pub. L. 89-329; 79 Stat. 1236; Pub. L. 99-498; 100 Stat. 1353; Pub. L. 105-244; 112 Stat. 1581; 20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], as amended through December 31, 1998. The fund for loans that are not coinsured by the federal government will be determined by the agency but may be no less than the Bank of North Dakota historical default rate. Funds appropriated under this chapter and designated as guarantee agency reserve funds for loans that are not coinsured by the federal government must be administered separately and segregated from reserve funds for loans that are coinsured by the federal government. The securities in which the moneys in the reserve funds may be invested must meet the same requirements as those authorized for investment under the state investment board. The income from such investments must be made available for the costs of administering the respective guarantee loan programs and income in excess of that required to pay the cost of administering the programs must be deposited in the respective reserve fund that corresponds to the source of the initial invested funds. The proceeds of reserve funds received from federal, state, or private sources, for the purpose of guaranteeing loans made to students as provided in this chapter, are appropriated as a continuing appropriation for the payment of defaulted loans guaranteed by each respective fund.

      Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the agency that a guaranteed loan made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter is in default, and the eligible lender has certified such fact to the agency, the agency shall reimburse the eligible lender making the loan from the reserve fund to the extent the loan was guaranteed by the fund. Whenever payment of the guaranteed principal balance of any insured or guaranteed loan is demanded of the agency, the note and accompanying evidence of the loan must be tendered to the agency in manner and form to confer good title so that the loan may be collected by the agency as it may determine according to law. Neither minority nor any statute of limitations may be used as a defense against collection of any loan through court proceedings.

     <p>
      Upon the granting of a scholarship and acceptance thereof, the recipient is eligible for a credit in fees in the enrolling institution of higher learning or state career and technical education program to apply toward the cost of registration, health, activities, board, books, and other necessary items of not to exceed six hundred sixty-seven dollars per quarter for three quarters, or one thousand dollars per semester for two semesters, in any academic year.

At the beginning of each quarter or semester of a regular academic year, the board for Indian scholarships shall certify to the director of the office of management and budget the name of each recipient and the amount payable, and the director of the office of management and budget shall issue a warrant to the state treasurer who shall pay the amount of the scholarship to the institution of higher learning or state career and technical education program in which the recipient is enrolled. Renewal of the scholarship award is subject to the maintenance of a minimum grade average of “C” in the courses taken.

      The board must be reimbursed from trust proceeds for all reasonable costs and expenses in managing land and investing trust proceeds. Such reimbursements are to be placed in the state lands maintenance fund. The net income derived from the land and money donated to the trust must be used for trust purposes, except the donor agreement may dedicate a percentage of the net income to trust principal.

     <p>
      The board of university and school lands must be reimbursed from trust proceeds for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the management of trust assets and the investment of trust proceeds. Reimbursements to the board must be deposited in the trust fund account from which the expenses were incurred. The net income derived from the assets held in trust must be used for trust purposes. Any assets placed in the trust may be sold, leased, invested, managed, or otherwise disposed of by the board to fulfill the reclamation activities and obligations related to the performance bond. If any of the trust assets include real property, net income from the trust assets must be used in part to pay to the county where the real property is located the same amount that would have been assessed against the real property for real property taxes if the real property was privately owned. The board may maintain separate accounts in the trust if necessary. The board shall manage all assets in the trust in the same manner that the board manages the board’s other trust assets or as otherwise may be required to satisfy the purposes of this chapter.
