    Tax levies against territory annexed.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At the first annual township meeting after the consolidation of the townships or the consolidation of a township and a fraction of a township, there must be levied against the fraction of a township or township annexed the sum found to be due to the township to which the annexation was made, and if the territory annexed is a fraction of a township which was detached from a civil township, the amount due to the original township to pay the outstanding indebtedness thereof, if any. Such levy is in addition to the levy provided by law. Taxes levied on the detached territory while it was a part of another civil township to pay anticipated obligations must be allocated to the detached territory, if the obligations for which the levy was made had not been incurred at the time the detachment became effective. Such taxes must be considered in levying the taxes provided for in this section. When the adjustment between a township and a fraction thereof detached therefrom and joined to another township involves the modification of tax levies theretofore made for the payment of any indebtedness for which an irrepealable levy was required to be made, notice of such modification must be given to all holders of bonds or other evidences of indebtedness. If such holders do not object to the modification within twenty days after such notice, they must be deemed to have concurred therein.

        District court erred in affirming the decision of a township board of supervisors denying an applicant’s petition for approval of the site of a proposed animal feeding operation (AFO) because the township misinterpreted and misapplied the law; none of the conditions under the statute were met which would allow the township to regulate the location of the proposed AFO by measuring the setbacks from a campground because the land was zoned for agricultural purposes and not recreational purposes.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The regulations and restrictions established in any township zoning district must be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan with reasonable consideration as to the character of such district, its peculiar suitability for particular uses, the normal growth of the municipality, and the various types of occupations, industries, and land uses within the area, and must be designed to facilitate traffic movement, encourage orderly growth and development of the municipality and adjacent areas, promote health, safety, and general welfare, and provide for emergency management. “Emergency management” means a comprehensive integrated system at all levels of government and in the private sector which provides for the development and maintenance of an effective capability to mitigate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from known and unforeseen hazards or situations, caused by an act of nature or man, which may threaten, injure, damage, or destroy lives, property, or our environment. The comprehensive plan must be a statement in documented text setting forth explicit goals, objectives, policies, and standards of the jurisdiction to guide public and private development within its control.

    Township zoning commissions — Membership — Reports and recommendations — District boundaries — Hearings — Notice.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of township supervisors of a township desiring to avail itself of the powers conferred by sections 58-03-11 through 58-03-15 shall establish, by resolution, a township zoning commission to recommend the boundaries of the various township zoning districts and appropriate regulations and restrictions to be established therein. Membership of the commission must consist of three township supervisors and two members appointed from the municipalities concerned in relation to which the zoning is contemplated. Where the area to be regulated and restricted is situated in two or more townships, a joint zoning commission may be established. Membership of a joint zoning commission must consist of two township supervisors from each township and two members from the municipality in relation to which the zoning is contemplated. A zoning commission shall make a preliminary report and hold public hearings before submitting its final report and recommendations to the board or boards of township supervisors. The board or boards of township supervisors may establish, and from time to time change, the boundaries of township zoning districts and establish, amend, supplement, and enforce regulations and restrictions in the districts. No regulation, restriction, or boundaries become effective until after a public hearing at which parties in interest and citizens have an opportunity to be heard. At least fifteen days’ notice of the time and place of the hearing must be published in the official newspaper of the county and also in the official newspaper of the municipality in relation to which the zoning action is taken, if in the municipality an official newspaper other than the official newspaper of the county is published. The description of any land within any zoning district established by a zoning commission together with any regulations and restrictions established must be filed with the governing bodies of the township and municipalities concerned, and if amendments are made to the boundaries of the zoning district or the regulations or restrictions, the amendments must be filed in the same manner. A zoning commission established under this section and a board of township supervisors shall state the grounds upon which any request for a zoning amendment or variance is approved or disapproved, and written findings upon which the decision is based must be included within the records of the commission or board.

     <p>
      The qualified electors present on the day of the annual or special meeting must be called to order by the township clerk, or, if the township clerk is not present, the qualified electors may elect by acclamation one of their number to act as chairman for the purpose of calling the meeting to order and to act as clerk after the selection of a moderator. The qualified electors shall elect by acclamation three of their number as judges, and such judges must be sworn and shall act as the judges of the qualifications of the qualified electors of the township. The qualified electors shall proceed to choose one of their number to preside as moderator of the meeting. The township clerk, if present, or in the township clerk’s absence, the clerk of the meeting, shall keep full minutes of its proceedings in which must be entered at length every order, direction, rule, and regulation made by the meeting. Meeting and voting hours of an annual or special meeting are optional with the township board, provided proper notice is given under the provisions of this chapter. The positions of moderator, clerk, and the three judges must be separate and distinct positions and no such positions may be held by the same person. The moderator, clerk, and the three judges each may be entitled to compensation of no more than sixty dollars per day for each day actually expended in the performance of their duties. Such salary must be paid out of township funds made available for such purpose. However, in those townships in which the offices of township clerk and treasurer have been merged, the person holding such office shall receive compensation as provided by law as township treasurer only and may not receive additional compensation for duties as clerk.

    Officers of a township — Terms of office.

      The elected officers of a civil township must be:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t58c58-05s58-05-02ol11">
       Three or five supervisors.

      </li>
      <li id="t58c58-05s58-05-02ol13">
       One assessor except as herein provided.

      <li id="t58c58-05s58-05-02ol14">
       One treasurer.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In townships with three-member boards of township supervisors, one supervisor must be elected at each annual township meeting and shall hold office for a term of three years. In townships with five-member boards of supervisors, the number of members of the board of supervisors whose terms have expired must be elected at each annual township meeting and shall hold office for a term of three years. The other elective officers must be elected every two years and shall hold their respective offices for a term of two years. Each officer shall serve until that officer’s successor is elected and qualified. The same person may hold the offices of township clerk and treasurer if a majority of the electors present vote in favor of the merging of such offices at the annual township meeting. The person elected to fill the merged office shall perform all of the duties required of both the township clerk and treasurer except as otherwise specifically provided by law. If a majority of the electors present and voting at an annual township meeting vote in favor of making the office of assessor appointive, the board of township supervisors shall appoint a township assessor for a four-year term of office, the first term commencing on January 1, 1974. In lieu of electing or appointing a township assessor, the board of township supervisors, if authorized by a majority of the electors present and voting at an annual township meeting, may on behalf of the township contract with the county in which the township is located or with any other political subdivision or with any individual to perform the duties of and have the powers of the township assessor. The length and terms of such a contract must be negotiated by the board of township supervisors with the governing body of the county or other political subdivision or with the individual, as the case may be, and the township is hereby authorized to make such payments as may be provided for in the contract. The electors of any township in which the office of township assessor was abolished prior to July 1, 1973, shall, at the next annual township meeting, elect a township assessor or authorize the board of township supervisors to appoint a township assessor or to contract for the making of the assessment as hereinbefore provided. The township electors may, by majority vote of those present and voting at an annual township meeting, change the previously adopted method of providing for the assessment to either of the other two methods authorized in this section, but such change does not become effective until expiration of the term of office of the assessor or until a vacancy occurs in the office of assessor or until expiration of the contract for making the assessments, whichever is applicable according to the method of providing for the assessment that was previously adopted.

      Except as otherwise provided by this section, no township officer may become a party to or be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract made by the board of which the officer is a member. Every contract or payment voted for or made contrary to this section is void. Any violation of this section constitutes malfeasance in office which subjects the offending officer to removal from office. A township officer may become a party to or be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract made by the board if:

      The board of township supervisors of a township shall propose a plan for the consolidation of the board of township officers with the officers of adjoining townships when three qualified electors or five percent of the qualified electors of the township, as determined by the number of qualified electors voting at the last annual township meeting, whichever is greater, petition the board. The township clerk, within fourteen days of receiving a petition, shall notify the board of township supervisors of each adjoining township of the proposal for consolidation and submit a copy of the proposal to the county auditor. The boards of township supervisors of each adjoining township shall respond to the proposal within thirty days.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the response of a board of township supervisors of an adjoining township indicates that the consolidation should be pursued, the clerk of the township proposing the consolidation shall call a meeting, or meetings if necessary, at a time and place agreed upon by the boards of each township. The chairman of the board of township supervisors of the township proposing the consolidation shall preside at the meeting. If requested by the board of township supervisors of the township proposing the consolidation, the board of township supervisors of each township shall submit a report of the assets, liabilities, and overall financial condition of each township for review by the other boards of township supervisors.
     </p>
     <p>
      If one or more boards of the townships responding to the proposal agreed to further pursue the proposed consolidation, the question of consolidation must be presented to the electors of each of the townships. However, no more than five adjoining townships may consolidate. Notice of the presentation of the question to the electors must be submitted to the county auditor by the board of township supervisors of the township proposing the consolidation. Upon receiving that notice, the county auditor shall assign an identifying number to the proposed multitownship board and notify the board of supervisors of each township of that number.

      On the third Tuesday of March following the consolidation election, a multitownship meeting must be held and the qualified electors shall elect a multitownship board of supervisors. If the number of consolidated townships is five or fewer, the multitownship board of supervisors must consist of one supervisor elected from each township. If the number of consolidated townships is two or four, an additional township supervisor must be elected at large so the multitownship board consists of three or five members. The length of the terms of the supervisors first elected must be staggered so that the terms of an equal amount of supervisors, or as nearly as practicable, expire each year. In addition, the qualified electors shall elect a multitownship clerk and a multitownship treasurer. The multitownship officers elected at the annual meeting shall assume all the powers and duties of the township officers of the townships approving the consolidation.

     <p>
      The township treasurer shall receive and take charge of all moneys belonging to the township or which by law are required to be paid into the township treasury and shall pay over and account for the same upon the order of the township or the officers thereof duly authorized in that behalf and shall perform all such duties as may be required of the township’s treasurer by law. Approval of orders or vouchers must be recorded in the record of the board’s proceedings and this is sufficient to indicate approval without requiring a majority of the board to sign or initial the voucher or order for payment. The township treasurer shall pay out no township funds except upon the warrant of the board of supervisors signed by the chairman of the board and countersigned by the clerk. The treasurer shall pay all warrants when presented, if properly drawn and signed, and if there is money in the treasurer’s hands or subject to the treasurer’s order sufficient for payment. The township treasurer may not issue the treasurer’s check on the depository bank, but shall countersign the warrant and insert the name of the depository bank thereon, and the warrant, when so countersigned and directed to the depository bank and properly endorsed by the payee, must be paid by the depository. Immediately upon countersigning any warrant, the township treasurer shall enter the payment in the township treasurer’s official record.

      Each township treasurer shall keep a suitable book to be provided at the expense of the township in which the township treasurer shall register serially all township warrants which are presented for payment and which cannot be paid for want of funds. When such warrants are presented to the township treasurer and cannot be paid for want of funds, the township treasurer shall endorse upon the back of each the words “not paid for want of funds”, giving the date of such endorsement, and shall sign that person’s name to such endorsement as township treasurer. When so endorsed, each warrant must bear interest from that date until it has been called for payment. Such warrants must be paid in the order in which they are presented for payment and registered out of the first moneys that come into the treasurer’s hands for such purposes.

     <p>
      For the purpose of making an improvement project and defraying the cost by special assessment, a board of township supervisors may create an improvement district upon petition of sixty percent of the freeholders in a proposed improvement district area. The improvement district must be designated by a name appropriate to the type of improvement and by a number distinguishing it from other improvement districts.

      After an improvement district has been created, the board of township supervisors shall direct a competent engineer to prepare a report as to the general nature, purpose, and feasibility of the proposed improvement and an estimate of the probable cost of the work. The board of township supervisors shall provide thirty days’ written notice by first-class mail to each freeholder within the improvement district at the address shown on the records of the county treasurer and shall publish a notice in a legal newspaper published in the township or, if there is no such newspaper, then in the county’s official newspaper at least ten days prior to a special meeting for public disclosure of the findings of the engineer.

    Election for proceeding.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At the special township meeting for public disclosure of the findings of the engineer, the freeholders of the township in attendance are entitled to vote on the question of whether to proceed with the improvement project. Upon approval by sixty percent or more of the votes cast at the meeting or votes filed with the township clerk within fifteen days after the meeting, the improvement project may proceed. A freeholder affected by the project is entitled to one vote for each dollar of the proposed special assessment against the freeholder’s property within the proposed improvement district. If there is more than one owner of a parcel of property, the votes available for the parcel must be prorated among the owners in accordance with each owner’s percentage interest in the property. If fewer than sixty percent of the votes cast or filed on the question approve the project, the election result is a bar against proceeding further with the improvement project described in the plans and specifications. An election result barring proceeding further with the improvement project does not preclude the payment of any costs incurred in developing the plans, specifications, cost estimates, or other costs which must be paid from the general fund of the township. If the costs incurred pose a financial burden on the general levy of a township of forty percent or more, the board of township supervisors may levy and collect assessments from the improvement district in yearly assessments not exceeding five years. If under forty percent, the township may use methods approved by law.

      Any aggrieved freeholder may appeal the special assessment against the freeholder’s real property by providing the township clerk a written notice of appeal, stating the grounds upon which the appeal is based, within twenty days after the special township meeting. The clerk shall notify the township board of supervisors of the appeal and schedule a special meeting to hear the appeals by publishing a notice of the special meeting at least ten days before the meeting in a legal newspaper published in the township or, if no such newspaper exists, in the county’s official newspaper. Any aggrieved freeholder who submitted an appeal may be heard and may present reasons to change the freeholder’s assessment at the special meeting. The board of township supervisors may hear the appeals and reasons and may increase or diminish any of the assessments as it may deem just, providing that the total amount of the assessments may not be changed and an assessment as adjusted may not exceed the benefits to the parcel of land on which it is assessed.
