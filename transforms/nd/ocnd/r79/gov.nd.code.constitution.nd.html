I, § 2 claim, which the individual asserted after he was denied permission to enter onto one of the corporation’s retail store properties in order to procure signatures on a political petition because: (1) § 2 merely guaranteed that North Dakota would offer a republican form of government to its citizens; (2) it had never been interpreted by the state courts as guaranteeing a right to petition on private property; and (3) the court would not extend the interpretation of § 2 beyond the historic interpretation that it had previously been given.

        In action by attorney general alleging violations of N.D.C.C ch. 13-07 and seeking dissolution of non-profit corporations, party who claimed his right to receive religious ministry could be impaired as a result of that action would be permitted to intervene as a defendant, where intervener had potentially different interests from other defendants, and the resources of those defendants to defend the action was impaired by the appointment of a receiver to manage and operate the corporations.

        Parents violated the compulsory school attendance law, former N.D.C.C ch. 15-34.1 (now N.D.C.C ch. 15.1-20), where they sent their children to a nonapproved church school because of claim that it would violate their religious beliefs to send their children to teachers who submitted themselves to the state certification process and to a school which submitted itself to approval by the county superintendent of schools and the superintendent of public instruction, conditions required by the compulsory school attendance law; the compulsory school attendance law, as applied to the parents, did not unduly impinge upon parent’s right to the free exercise of religion since the state constitutional mandate for the provision of schools and education, N.D. Const. art. VIII, established a compelling interest by the state in the education of its people, with teacher certification being an acceptable method of satisfying part of that mandate, and the resulting strain or imposition on the parent’s religious beliefs by the compulsory school attendance law was outbalanced by the state’s compelling interest in the education of its people.

      Every man may freely write, speak and publish his opinions on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that privilege.

       <p>
        City ordinances that prohibited business that served alcohol from also offering adult entertainment, and allowed adult entertainment establishments to operate only in certain zoned areas did not violate the bars’
   First Amendment right to free speech, and therefore the city was properly granted summary judgment, because: (1) the city was regulating under a legitimate governmental power; (2) the ordinances did not completely eliminate adult entertainment; (3) the ordinances were aimed at combating the negative secondary effects caused by adult entertainment establishments rather than at the suppression of expression; (4) the ordinances served a substantial government interest; and (5) the ordinances were not overbroad and were narrowly tailored, as they were focused on the four walls of the barroom, and the detailed findings on the adverse secondary effects of adult establishments supported a broad disclosure requirement beyond obscenity-related criminal offenses.

        If there is any doubt as to the meaning of a publication claimed to be libelous, or if such publication is reasonably susceptible of two constructions, one innocent and the other libelous, then it is a question for the jury which construction is the proper one. McCue v. Equity Coop. Publishing Co., 39 N.D. 190, 167 N.W. 225, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 1918).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Grant of summary judgment in favor of a writer in a initiative drafter’s defamation action was appropriate because the drafter was at least a limited purpose public figure and he needed to present clear and convincing evidence that the writer’s statements were false and made with actual malice, which he failed to do. It was therefore presumed that the evidence did not exist.

       <p>
        Government regulation which only incidentally restricts speech, is valid if four criteria are met: 1. The regulation is within the constitutional power of the state; 2. It furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; 3. The governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; 4. The incidental restriction on alleged first amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest. State v. Niska, 380 N.W.2d 646, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

I, § 4 guaranteed the rights of North Dakota citizens against government action but had no application with regard to the actions of private citizens; and (3) N.D. Const. art.

        Retail corporation was granted summary judgment as to an individual’s N.D. Const. art. I, § 5 claim, which the individual asserted after he was denied permission to enter onto one of the corporation’s retail store properties in order to procure signatures on a political petition because: (1) N.D. Const. art. I, § 5 coexisted with U.S. Const. amend. I and did not extend the rights of citizens beyond those protected under amend. I; (2) N.D. Const. art. I, § 5 guaranteed the rights of North Dakota citizens against government action but had no application with regard to the actions of private citizens; and (3) N.D. Const. art. I, § 5 did not give the individual a right to enter onto the corporation’s private property in order to exercise his constitutionally guaranteed assembly and petition rights.

        North Dakota Supreme Court agrees with other courts that a warrant supported by probable cause, regardless of whether it is a felony or misdemeanor warrant, provides a law officer authority to enter the residence of the person named in the warrant in order to execute the warrant. Therefore, a motion to suppress was improperly granted based on the entry into a residence to serve a misdemeanor warrant; consent was not required for entry.

        Where defendant failed to provide arguments based on state constitution aside from bare assertions that a search violated this section, supreme court declined to adopt a more “expansive view” of the protections afforded under the North Dakota Constitution than of those afforded under the U.S. Constitution. State v. Kunkel, 455 N.W.2d 208, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are three basic premises in search and seizure cases: (1) all searches made without a valid search warrant are unreasonable unless shown to come within one of the exceptions to the rule requiring warrants; (2) where there is an allegation of an illegal search, the state bears the burden of proving its validity; and (3) by virtue of the decision in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 6 L. Ed. 2d 1081, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 16 Ohio Op. 2d 384, 84 A.L.R.2d 933, evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in state courts. State v.

        In determining whether or not a search is within the scope of the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the “reasonable expectation of privacy” test is to be applied. State v. Planz, 304 N.W.2d 74, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 278</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the state constitution may afford broader rights than those granted under an equivalent provision of the federal constitution, like the Fourth Amendment, this section is not implicated unless a reasonable expectation of privacy is invaded. State v. Rode, 456 N.W.2d 769, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Law enforcement officer’s use of a drug-sniffing dog in a secure apartment hallway did not violate defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure because there existed no generalized expectation of privacy in the common areas of an apartment building. State v. Nguyen, 2013 ND 252, 841 N.W.2d 676, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 258</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Evidence used to convict the first defendant and second defendant of strict liability hunting offenses due to their conduct in illegally shooting a deer on a wildlife refuge did not have to be suppressed due to the entry of a deputy sheriff and a game warden on their farmstead, which occurred without permission and without a warrant. Although the first defendant and second defendant allegedly had “no trespassing” signs posted on their property, the record did not show where those signs were located and, thus, they did not show that their reasonable expectation of privacy under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV, as applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and under N.D. Const. art. I, § 8 was violated.

       <p>
        Garbage searches did not violate this section; by placing her garbage on or against the public alley, where it was exposed to the general public, and with the express purpose of abandoning it to the trash collector, defendant waived any privacy interest she may have had in the garbage. State v. Rydberg, 519 N.W.2d 306, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section of the North Dakota Constitution may provide greater protection than the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution in some instances, but the North Dakota Constitution does not provide any more protection than that afforded by the United States Constitution when there is no objectively reasonable expectation of privacy, and defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in his garbage set out for collection. State v. Carriere, 545 N.W.2d 773, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any expectation of privacy in garbage is waived when the items are placed into garbage cans as trash, intended to be picked up by garbage collectors, and the cans are placed in an area where unknown garbage collectors could pick them up and where other unknown people could rummage through the cans. State v. Herrick, 1997 ND 155, 567 N.W.2d 336, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>

        After excising tainted evidence, a search warrant was supported by probable cause where police searched defendant’s garbage and found burned tin foil consistent with methamphetamine use and a cut up hanger with the strong smell of marijuana.
   State v. Fields, 2005 ND 15, 691 N.W.2d 233, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the current rule in North Dakota and federal courts, defendant lost his expectation of privacy when he placed the trash for collection on the sidewalk in front of his house, and therefore the garbage search fell outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment and N.D. Const. art. 1, § 8.
   State v. Schmalz, 2008 ND 27, 744 N.W.2d 734, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrantless search of a defendant’s trash was not a violation of defendant’s right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.D. Const. art. I, § 8 because defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy therein as the trash was placed next to the street on a berm next to a mailbox for normal collection.

        While not every factual layer in the affidavit in support of the search warrant would have warranted a person of reasonable caution to believe evidence of drug activity could be found in defendant's residence, the laminated total of all such factual layers, including that a marijuana seller went into defendant's residence after meeting with the confidential informant (CI) and then called the CI with pricing and arranged for a larger purchase, was sufficient to do so.

        A warrant issued for the search of a farm for “livestock, ear tags, and other livestock paraphernalia which was stolen”, was sufficiently specific where the officers executing the warrant enlisted the aid of the owners of the stolen calves to positively identify their calves, they searched only in the areas where the listed items were likely to be found and they seized only those cattle which were positively identified as stolen.

        Search warrant which identified the property sought as “various items which I have reason to believe have been recently stolen in Williams County which are evidence of crimes recently committed” did not particularly describe the things to be seized as commanded by the federal and state constitutions, and the trial court erred in refusing to suppress evidence seized thereunder.

        If there is only one building thereon, the description of premises in a search warrant as a certain lot in a certain block is sufficient. State v. Markuson, 7 N.D. 155, 73 N.W. 82, 1897 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 1897).

        Omission of the word “premises” from the probable cause and command portions of a search warrant did not prohibit police from searching the defendant’s residence; the warrant included outbuildings, vehicles and the curtilage of the residence, and the omission of “premises” was a technical error.

A closed door did not invite unauthorized entry and mere access to 501 was insufficient to extend the reach of the warrant. State v. Erickson, 496 N.W.2d 555, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Court did not err by denying defendant’s request for a Franks hearing based on defendant’s assertion that the officer misrepresented to the district court that the rubber gloves and shop towels found in the sewer system could be directly traced back to defendant because, even without the information that their origins pointed to only two houses, defendant’s residence remained one of seven residences as a potential source for those items. The proffered affidavit neither rebutted the fact that the gloves and towels were found in the sewer, which as the officer testified indicated the presence of methamphetamine production, nor did the affidavit eliminate defendant’s house as a potential source for those materials.

        Fact that defendant may have had a firearm was insufficient by itself to provide probable cause for a no-knock entry, but only the no-knock aspect of the search warrant was invalid, not the search warrant as a whole; and as the officer functionally excised its invalid portion by knocking and announcing his entry, suppression of evidence seized in the search was not required. State v. Roth, 2004 ND 23, 674 N.W.2d 495, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        Affidavits, even though specific and obviously prepared in haste, may establish probable cause and justify the issuance of a search warrant when judged in a commonsense and realistic fashion; where an investigation involved crimes of great magnitude and it was reasonably established that there existed a justifiable connection which gave cause to search an accused’s living quarters and automobile, the affidavits established the necessary probable cause and issuance of a search warrant was justified. Iverson v. North Dakota, 480 F.2d 414, 1973 U.S. App. LEXIS 9495 (8th Cir. N.D.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1044, 94 S. Ct. 549, 38 L. Ed. 2d 335, 1973 U.S. LEXIS 1531 (U.S. 1973).

        In view of the special protection given to the home by the Fourth Amendment and this section, something additional and more objective than the facile conclusion that contraband is ordinarily kept in the home should be required to establish probable cause to search that home, particularly where it was apparent that the officers believed the contraband was in a particular place, and where only after a search of that place failed to reveal the contraband did the officers rely upon their training and knowledge to justify the search of the defendant’s residence.

        Information about a defendant which included false information, and represented only unsupported conclusions and statements about his reputation of being “suspected of trafficking narcotics,” without some elaboration of the underlying circumstances for those conclusions and statements, was insufficient to support a determination that probable cause existed to issue a warrant to search the defendant’s house.

        Under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, magistrate had probable cause to issue search warrant based on reliable chain of information supplied by police, ample facts from crime scene, and link between defendant and alleged crime. State v. Damron, 1998 ND 71, 575 N.W.2d 912, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1998).

        Evidence found in defendant’s garage including potting soil bags, a marijuana seed and marijuana stems coupled with defendant’s prior drug convictions were sufficient to establish probable cause for magistrate to issue a search warrant despite the fact that officer failed to inform magistrate that his information originated from an anonymous informant. State v. Duchene, 2001 ND 66, 624 N.W.2d 668, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 2001).

       <p>
        While individual bits of information that associated defendant with trafficking in drugs may not have been sufficient separately to establish probable cause, all the information taken together, along with the experience and training of the police officers was sufficient to establish probable cause; likewise, the information about defendant previously being suspected of growing marijuana at his home was stale on its own, but in conjunction with the other evidence, established probable cause. State v. Guthmiller, 2002 ND 116, 646 N.W.2d 724, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        Considering the totality of the circumstances, especially the detailed, first-hand knowledge the informant provided to the police officers about the methamphetamine lab, the officer’s failure to inform the magistrate that the informant had lied about his identity and that he had received a deal did not defeat probable cause to issue the search warrant that led to defendant’s arrest and conviction for possession of and manufacturing methamphetamine. State v. Holzer, 2003 ND 19, 656 N.W.2d 686, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 15</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        In a case involving methamphetamines, a court properly denied defendants’ motion to suppress where the presence of anhydrous and the large quantity of Sudafed (ingredients in methamphetamines), as well as the condition of the partially concealed garage, created a substantial basis to conclude that probable cause existed to search the premises. State v. Ballweg, 2003 ND 153, 670 N.W.2d 490, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        Simultaneous purchase of innocent items, such as sulfuric acid (in the form of drain opener) and suphedrine (an over-the-counter medication) can become suspicious under circumstances indicating the items will be used to manufacture drugs.
   State v. Dodson, 2003 ND 187, 671 N.W.2d 825, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a drug case, a court properly denied defendants’ motion to suppress where, although information regarding a suspicious person visiting defendants was insufficient alone to establish probable cause, the presence of anhydrous, Sudafed, and other supplies used to manufacture methamphetamine was indicative of further drug activity. State v. Ballweg, 2003 ND 153, 670 N.W.2d 490, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       <p>
        An affidavit noting evidence of suphedrine and tinfoil with burn marks discovered during search of garbage bags of individuals believe to be associated with defendant, a vehicle associated with the manufacture of methamphetamine parked outside defendant’s residence, and defendant’s purchase of sulfuric acid, was sufficient to justify further investigation but insufficient to show probable cause for a warrant. State v. Dodson, 2003 ND 187, 671 N.W.2d 825, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        When the defendant had repeatedly been a registered guest of a hotel room where drugs, paraphernalia, and weaponry were found; defendant was a suspect in the aggravated assault of an alleged drug informant at another hotel; and after the assault, police found marijuana and a scale in another suspect’s hotel room; there was sufficient probable cause for a person of reasonable caution to believe that evidence of drug use and trafficking would be found in the defendant’s hotel room. State v. Utvick, 2004 ND 36, 675 N.W.2d 387, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        In a drug case, probable cause to search defendant’s home was lacking where, if an illegally found foil bindle was excluded, the remaining evidence included only defendant’s delusional erratic behavior, and the statement that her husband “made it right here,” which the officer interpreted to mean that defendant’s husband made methamphetamine in their home. However, if the officer correctly believed that the husband made methamphetamine in the home, it would have been three or four weeks since it last occurred because the officer knew that he was in drug rehabilitation at the time, and therefore, the information was stale.

       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit in support of the search warrant contained sufficient probable cause where, under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, there was a substantial basis for the determination that contraband and drug evidence would probably be found in the apartment unit. Among other things, the police observed a suspect enter the apartment to obtain drugs on two separate occasions and the suspect called the confidential informant from the apartment stating that the drug source wanted more money.

       </p>
       <p>
        Probable cause supported the issuance of a search warrant because the officer offered witnesses’
   observations of open windows in cold weather and cylindrical tanks being taken into defendant’s house, and the officer testified that the presence of tanks and the open windows was indicative of methamphetamine production. The officer testified that rubber gloves and shop towels had been coming into the city’s sewer system, the city had traced those items directly back to a manhole cover near defendant’s residence, and because it was a closed sewer system, the items could only have originated from defendant’s house or the mayor’s house.

       <p>
        Denial of suppression motion was affirmed because officers had probable cause to arrest an individual lying in the back seat of a vehicle for physical obstruction of government function, preventing arrest and burglary, where, during the investigation of a burglary the officers observed defendant and his companion in the vehicle and observed gloves, a hammer and a crowbar, and the occupants refused to open the vehicle and the officers had a locksmith open the vehicle. The officers’ use of a locksmith to open the vehicle to effectuate the arrest of the occupants was eminently reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, seizure of the evidence would have been justified under the plain view doctrine or as incident to a lawful arrest, and the officers’ use of caution in obtaining a search warrant before proceeding further and their subjective beliefs as to the existence or nonexistence of reasonable suspicion and probable cause were of no moment.
   State v. Washington, 2007 ND 138, 737 N.W.2d 382, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 2007).

        Based on the officer’s testimony regarding his training and experience as a police officer, the smell of marijuana on three pieces of evidence found in defendant’s trash can, a paper towel with marijuana residue, packaging tape, and cellophane packaging, there was a sufficient factual basis to issue a search warrant for defendant’s home.
   State v. Schmalz, 2008 ND 27, 744 N.W.2d 734, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in denying defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the illegal search, because the issuance of the search warrant was not supported by probable cause, when the search warrant application and supporting testimony did not contain information describing defendant’s residence, whether trash belonging to others could be placed in this location, and whether the evidence was found in a trash bag or whether the alleged contraband was found in the same bag as the mail.
   State v. Kieper, 2008 ND 65, 747 N.W.2d 497, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 2008).

       <p>
        Defendant’s passenger’s breath sample indicated a blood alcohol content of .083 percent, which provided probable cause that she committed the crime of minor in possession of alcohol, and defendant’s admission that there was alcohol in the car, coupled with the evidence that the passenger had consumed alcohol, would be enough to provide a reasonable belief that the passenger had actual control over those beverages in the vehicle, thus violating the law prohibiting minors from being in possession of alcohol; thus, the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle for alcohol, as it constituted an identifiable object connected with the passenger’s criminal activity.
   State v. Zwicke, 2009 ND 129, 767 N.W.2d 869, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to suppress the fruits of a search from his van because probable caused existed to issue the search warrant; defendant had been at a bar with the murder victim, the victim left the bar with him in the van, and no one had seen the victim since; defendant had a significant criminal history, including at least one violent crime. State v. Wacht, 2013 ND 126, 833 N.W.2d 455, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 2013).

       <p>
        Although a police officer entered a constitutionally protected space when she stepped into a hotel room without a search warrant and without exigent circumstances, the district court did not err in applying the independent source doctrine, as the search warrant affidavit, excised of its tainted information, was supported by probable cause derived from sources independent of the illegal search. State v. Kuruc, 2014 ND 95, 846 N.W.2d 314, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an attempted murder case, a district court did not err by failing to suppress evidence obtained by a search warrant because probable cause existed, as required by the United States and North Dakota Constitutions, since there was a fair probability that evidence would have been found on defendant's person, and in her home and vehicle. It was a reasonable inference that the assailant did not intend to leave the area on foot in stocking feet in winter, clothing evidence was pertinent to the investigation, and two sources mentioned in the affidavit provided a nexus to defendant's home.
   State v. Leavitt, 2015 ND 146, 864 N.W.2d 472, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in denying defendant’s motion to suppress as probable cause did not exist for a search warrant for a package because, although the detective had multiple courses in interdiction training, and he testified that the shipping store employee thought defendant behaved unusually, that the shape of the contents strongly indicated the presence of cash, that Colorado was a source state for marijuana, and that both defendant and the recipient of the package had prior drug convictions; and, although the evidence showed that defendant might have been sending cash rather than an owner’s manual, as he stated, nothing more than a hunch showed that defendant was sending illicit proceeds from the sale of drugs. State v. Biwer, 2018 ND 185, 915 N.W.2d 837, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress evidence because a police officer’s inspection of a broken light bulb was not an independent search requiring probable cause since the officer was lawfully in a position to view the bulb, and the evidence seized was in plain view; the officer did not move or touch any piece of the broken bulb until after he realized it was drug paraphernalia, but he only bent down to get a better look at it.

       <p>
        Although courts presume the reliability of citizen informants, their reliability should be evaluated from the nature of their reports, their opportunity to observe the matters reported, and the extent to which it can be verified by independent investigation; thus, a citizen report that defendant did “more than his share of buying and selling methamphetamine” could not be used to support probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant, because there was no evidentiary support for the statement. State v. Dodson, 2003 ND 187, 671 N.W.2d 825, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit based on information supplied by an informant satisfied probable cause requirement where the affidavit, although not specifically stating that the informant was reliable, stated that the affiant had known the informant several years, that the informant had cooperated with him in the past, and that the facts supplied by the informant had checked out as informant had said they would. State v. Mertens, 268 N.W.2d 446, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the existence of probable cause when the affidavit in support of the search warrant is based on hearsay information given to the affiant by an informant, the magistrate must take into account the status of the informant in judging his credibility or reliability, and in inquiring into informant’s basis-of-knowledge may consider that the informant named in the affidavit is either a good citizen, a victim of a crime, or a disinterested observer. State v. Klosterman, 317 N.W.2d 796, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 258</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information supplied by an anonymous informant cannot alone establish probable cause for a warrant if the tip provides virtually nothing from which one might conclude that the informant is honest or that his information is reliable, or if the information gives absolutely no indication of the basis for the informant’s predictions regarding a defendant’s criminal activities. State v. Thompson, 369 N.W.2d 363, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 330</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit held insufficient to provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause where the anonymous informant’s tip and the surrounding facts did not possess an internal coherence that gave weight to the whole, nor did the scope of police investigatory work performed adequately bolster the conclusory nature of the anonymous informant’s tip. State v. Thompson, 369 N.W.2d 363, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 330</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where interviews with two different confidential informants were conducted from one to four months before search warrant was issued, magistrate and police properly relied on that information to the extent it established defendants were involved with drug trafficking; the matter was corroborated by their prior records, and the information was corroborated by information supplied by an anonymous informant’s tip and other independent police investigations. State v. Ringquist, 433 N.W.2d 207, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 234</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable cause for issuance of warrant to search drug suspect’s home existed where reliable informant advised officer affiant that he had overheard telephone conversation where arrangements for drug pickup were made, where affiant followed person who made telephone call to house for which search warrant was sought and where affiant saw individual leave house with a brown paper object about the size of a baseball. State v. Dymowski, 458 N.W.2d 490, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the totality-of-the-circumstances test, evidence including statement by reliable citizen informant regarding drug dealings and verification by police of ongoing drug activity at residence supported magistrate’s finding of probable cause to issue search warrant. State v. Rangeloff, 1998 ND 135, 580 N.W.2d 593, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the fact that information regarding an informant’s record was left out of an application for a search warrant of defendant’s residence, the search warrant was still valid; moreover, evidence that defendant had been involved in the theft of anhydrous ammonia storage tanks and possessed receipts for multiple purchases of batteries and pseudoephedrine was sufficient to establish probable cause for the warrant. State v. Corum, 2003 ND 89, 663 N.W.2d 151, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an officer-affiant vouched for a confidential informant’s reliability and veracity, the informant had provided reliable information about drug traffickers in the past, and supplied detailed information about defendant’s manufacture of methamphetamine, the fact that the information was old was not fatal, since it indicated ongoing criminal activity involving defendant and supported a finding of probable cause for issuance of a search warrant. State v. Roth, 2004 ND 23, 674 N.W.2d 495, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although affidavit in support of search warrant was not deliberately false where informant later denied making statements alleging illegal drug activities at the defendant’s residence but it was found those statements were heard by another officer, the affidavit did contain misleading second-hand statements about past incidents allegedly supporting the informant’s credibility.
   Once the misleading statements were stricken, the affidavit was insufficient to establish the credibility of the informant since the informant was a member of the “criminal milieu” and credibility was not presumed; the existence of the defendant’s vehicle described by the informant was an easily obtainable fact and was not sufficient to support the credibility of the informant as something more substantial was necessary to establish the credibility of a member of the criminal milieu.
   State v. Donovan, 2004 ND 201, 688 N.W.2d 646, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 336</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable cause to execute a search warrant for defendant’s residence and business premises existed where the reliability of the informants was established; all four informants gave detailed, firsthand information, much of which was internally corroborated. The trial court’s consideration of police officers’
   surveillance testimony was also reasonable in establishing probable cause.
   State v. Stewart, 2006 ND 39, 710 N.W.2d 403, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Search warrant was supported by probable cause under N.D. Const. art. I, § 8 because a confidential informant stated that the informant used methamphetamine at defendant’s house, the affiant saw the informant at defendant’s residence, and the affiant also saw needle marks on the informant’s arms.
   State v. Johnson, 2011 ND 48, 795 N.W.2d 367, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        When information from defendant's cell phone was excised from the affidavit, sufficient evidence remained to establish probable cause to issue a search warrant, including a detective's affidavit he received multiple tips that a black male known as “D” was distributing heroin, “D” was defendant, and an informant told the detective she saw defendant with heroin and he was her main source for heroin.
   State v. Chatman, 2015 ND 296, 872 N.W.2d 595, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 310</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to establish probable cause for the third search warrant because the detective testified that the new residents told the detective that they recently moved in and that defendant moved upstairs; and the detective verified defendant’s address before obtaining the third warrant, for which the new residents’ statements and corroborating observations created a sufficient nexus. State v. Biwer, 2018 ND 185, 915 N.W.2d 837, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 2018).

   totality of the circumstances formula, the supreme court abandoned the former two-prong test in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964) and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969) for determining the existence of probable cause. Nevertheless, the supreme court of North Dakota recognizes an affiant’s “basis of knowledge,” one prong of the Aguilar test, is a highly relevant consideration under the Illinois v. Gates totality of the circumstances test. Furthermore, in determining probable cause, sufficient information, rather than “bare-bones” information, must be presented to the magistrate. State v. Schroeder, 450 N.W.2d 423, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Search warrant providing for a nighttime search was not supported by probable cause where other than a single incident of a controlled buy, there was nothing in the record to indicate that without the nighttime search, the evidence would have been destroyed to removed from the premises before a search could have been executed in the morning hours, nor was there evidence that the buy conducted in the vicinity of defendant's residence was part of an ongoing trafficking operation where drugs were moved, traded, bought, or sol during the nighttime hours.

        District court properly denied defendant's motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to suppress because, despite defendant's arguments concerning a dog sniff and law enforcement's reliance on the telephone calls she made from jail, the search warrant for her luggage was supported by probable cause where the totality of the circumstances established probable cause to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe evidence of contraband would be found in defendant's luggage.

        Trial court erred by finding that probable cause for the search warrant for defendant’s home did not exist because the drug task force had received an anonymous tip that defendant had recently returned from out of town with marijuana, and defendant’s garbage contained empty packaging and tubing with labels stating that they contained THC and marijuana. The required nexus between the contents of the garbage and the home was established because officers obtained defendant’s address from his drivers license and the garbage can was located in a manner where it would be regularly retrieved by the garbage truck.

        Defendant was entitled to suppress contraband found in defendant's backpack because defendant was not an occupant of the residence belonging to the individual who was the subject of a probationary search, but was, at most, a frequent visitor who kept personal belongings at the residence. Furthermore, there was no reasonable and articulable suspicion to support the continued detention of defendant while the police waited for a K-9 unit to arrive and check defendant's backpack when defendant did not consent to a search of the backpack.

        While warrantless searches of automobiles may be permissible in some cases where similar searches of buildings would not be, due to the vehicle’s mobility, the lesser expectation of privacy therein, the fact that automobiles are frequently in the plain view of the police, or because they may come into police custody and become subject to inventory search, none of these considerations justified the warrantless search of a car found stuck in a snowbank on private property by police engaged in an attempted robbery investigation; because there was no reason to believe the vehicle contained contraband, and because the police had ample time to obtain a warrant, their search without one was unreasonable and evidence discovered in the course of it should have been suppressed.

        Warrantless search of automobile for bottles of beer was justified, and a pistol found during the search was properly admitted into evidence, where officer who had observed defendant drinking beer while driving drove alongside car after defendant had parked and left it, saw opened six-pack and one open bottle of beer in plain view inside the car and searched car for more beer after being unable to locate defendant who had remained in immediate vicinity and whose mother, among others, knew officer was looking for defendant.

        Officer had probable cause to believe vehicle contained additional contraband and properly searched the vehicle under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement where a breathalyzer test of driver and an under-aged passenger revealed alcohol consumption and, thus, evidence seized from the vehicle, including methamphetamine, methamphetamine paraphernalia, and marijuana, should not have been suppressed.

        Although a trooper might not have been certain that defendant’s syringes were for drug use, when combined with the butane lighters, they were enough to warrant a belief that they might be drug paraphernalia and evidence of drug activity; based on the presence of butane lighters and syringes that the trooper saw on the front passenger’s seat, both known by the trooper to be used for drug production and use, and defendant’s statements, a reasonable person in the trooper’s position would have concluded that there was probable cause to search defendant’s vehicle. Because the trooper had probable cause to search, the evidence found in defendant’s vehicle was admissible under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement and, therefore, the trial court improperly granted defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence found in defendant’s vehicle.

        Officers were justified in conducting a warrantless search of defendant’s vehicle under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement; given that defendant had already informed officers that there was alcohol in the truck and the passenger’s breath sample indicated that she had illegally consumed alcohol, the officers had probable cause to believe the vehicle contained seizable items, and by the time the officers would have obtained a warrant and sought out defendant’s vehicle again, there would have been a near certitude that the evidence would have been either moved or disposed of.

        A combination of probable cause and exigent circumstances is required to permit the warrantless, nonconsensual entry into a suspect’s home to make a felony arrest; the imminent destruction of evidence of a crime may be a sufficient exigent circumstance to permit the warrantless, nonconsensual entry into a home to make an arrest; however, when destruction of evidence is the exigent circumstance, there must be more than a mere belief that such destruction is probable, coupled with the fact that the suspect knows or will soon become aware that the police are on his trail, and that the entry is the least intrusive which, under the circumstances, is possible.

        Law enforcement officers frequently act in the role of community caretaker, actions separate from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute. It is not a Fourth Amendment seizure for a police officer to approach and talk with a person in a public place, including a stopped vehicle, in this caretaker role. City of Fargo v.

        Evidence supported the finding that the officer acted as a community caretaker when he approached the driver because the officer could not be sure whether the driver, slumped over the steering wheel, was simply sleeping or in need of assistance, and as a result of the encounter, the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was in actual physical control of the vehicle in violation of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.39.html#t39c39-08s39-08-01" target="_blank">39-08-01</a></cite>.

        District court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to suppress because defendant’s rights under the Fourth Amendment and N.D. Const. art. I, § 8 were not violated; during the officer’s initial encounter with defendant, he was engaged in a community caretaking function because, given that it was an early January morning and the apparent lack of movement of the person inside the pickup, the officer’s subsequent approach of the vehicle, yelling, and rapping on the window was reasonable and was not a seizure. The officer’s subsequent observations gave the officer the requisite reasonable and articulable suspicion to detain defendant because defendant appeared very confused “for many seconds” and was “genuinely out of it;” these observations, combined with the officer’s initial observations of the truck in an empty lot at 2:00 a.m. in January with a person leaning or slumped toward the center and the vehicle still there almost a half an hour later gave the officer a reasonable suspicion that defendant was impaired.

        Defendant claimed that she was unlawfully seized and that the search of her purse, in which drug paraphernalia was discovered, exceeded the scope of her consent to search, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth amendments; nevertheless, the supreme court determined that sufficient evidence existed in the record to support the trial court’s finding that defendant was not seized at the time she consented to the search, as the officer had returned her driver’s license to her, and he told her that she was free to leave; also, her consent to search was not exceeded by the search of her purse.

        In a drug case, a court erred in failing to suppress evidence because defendant did not consent to a search of her entire home where she did not ask officers for help finding her inhaler, the officers did not specifically request defendant’s consent to search the home, the officers told her they would help and asked where she last had the inhaler, and in response to the officers’
   question, defendant said it was probably in the den and where an officer then went upstairs to search for the inhaler. Even if defendant’s testimony that she told the officer that the inhaler was not upstairs was disregarded, a reasonable person would not believe her conduct showed consent to search her entire home.

        Defendant and codefendant’s convictions for drug offenses were affirmed where the trial court properly denied their motion to suppress evidence seized at their apartment because, although the codefendant had not verbally consented to a search of the apartment when the officers followed her into the apartment, the trial court properly concluded that the illegality of the officers’
   initial entry into the apartment was purged by defendant’s subsequent written consent to search the apartment after consultation with an attorney.

        Defendant’s voluntary consent was an independent cause of the discovery of the challenged evidence and purged the taint of the illegal stop where, even though there was only 45 minutes between the illegal stop and defendant’s consent to the searches, other evidence indicated that the consent was sufficiently the act of free will, including: (1) defendant had been read his Miranda rights; (2) he was told he was not under arrest; (3) he was told he could refuse to consent to the searches; (4) he had been transported to a different location from where the unlawful police conduct occurred; (5) he was questioned by a different officer; (6) he was relaxed, cooperative, and complied with the officer’s requests; and (7) the officers did not use coercive or abusive tactics.

        Driving privileges were properly suspended for driving under the influence because there was no violation of the United States or North Dakota Constitutions relating to search and seizure; being informed of the penalties under the state implied consent laws did not amount to coercion, and the reading of the advisory prior to the onsite screening test was also not coercive.

        Where defendant sought to suppress evidence obtained by searching various packages to be delivered by a delivery company and his home, suppression was denied as reasonable suspicion supported the seizure where a delivery company employee reported to police suspicious packages, the police arrived with a canine unit and drug-sniffing dogs alerted to one of the defendant’s packages and alerted a second time when the same package was hidden from the dog. A seizure would have occurred at the time the package was delayed in its delivery, which may have occurred at the time of the second testing of the package; however, since the dog had already alerted to the package prior to that time, reasonable suspicion existed at that point to seize the package. Because there was no evidence that would cause a reasonable officer to doubt the validity of the dog’s first alert, the dog’s first alert created reasonable suspicion, which permitted the police to seize the package for investigation.

        An officer’s entry into defendant’s garage was valid and proper and did not constitute an unreasonable search, where the officer observed defendant lying in his open garage beside his car and, based upon his observation and additional information received by a witness, the officer’s entry was made more for the purpose of rendering aid to a possibly ill person than to look for evidence of a crime. Lubenow v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 438 N.W.2d 528, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        Actions of sheriff's deputies fell within the emergency exception to the Fourth Amendment protections from unreasonable searches and seizures, justifying a warrantless entry into defendant's residence.

        District court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress evidence because a police officer’s direct and contemporaneous observations supported his entry into defendant’s home, and thus, the officer’s entry was justified under the emergency exception to the warrant requirement. the officer had a reasonable basis to believe there was an ongoing emergency before entering defendant’s home because he was concerned defendant could have been ambushed or that defendant could have harmed himself.

        Defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied as the State presented sufficient evidence to conclude that law enforcement had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was engaged or about to engage in criminal activity because a narcotics task force officer testified that while he was off duty, he observed defendant traveling to a local park known for drug use and sales; previous reports labeled defendant as part of the drug trade in the park; and law enforcement cameras set up in the area captured images of his truck in the area on numerous occasions; thus, the intrusion of defendant’s constitutional rights, and the scope of the intrusion was reasonably related to the circumstances which justified the interference.

        Although a police officer entered a constitutionally protected space when she stepped into a hotel room without a search warrant and without exigent circumstances, the district court did not err in applying the independent-source doctrine, as the search warrant affidavit, excised of its tainted information, was supported by probable cause derived from sources independent of the illegal search.

        Because the unchallenged second search warrant for defendant’s previous residence was based on the results of the detective’s valid trash pull conducted at the property before obtaining the unlawful search warrant for a package, and the detective discovered controlled substances in bags together with documents bearing defendant’s name and information, the second search warrant was supported by probable cause independent of the package, and the detective’s decision to seek the second warrant was not prompted by observations made while searching the package. Because the second and third warrants were based on probable cause derived from independent sources, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine was not applied to suppress the evidence.

        Where defendant was not arrested but was taken into custody for detoxification, it was proper for police officer at the jail to make a warrantless examination of the contents of defendant’s wallet as part of a routine inventory search conducted pursuant to standard jail procedure and to make a warrantless seizure of a piece of paper found in the wallet where the officer had probable cause to believe the paper contained illegal drugs.

       </p>
       <p>
        The warrantless search of and resultant seizure of evidence from a wallet were within the inventory-search exception to the warrant requirement where there was unrebutted testimony that the search conducted at the jail after defendant’s arrest was to inventory the contents of the wallet and there was no evidence that inventorying the wallets of arrested persons at the jail was not a standard jailhouse procedure; legality of the inventory search and resultant seizure was not altered by fact that a drug enforcement agent, who was present during the inventory search and who seized the evidence from the wallet, may have had an investigative as well as an inventory purpose in searching the wallet.

       <p>
        Evidence seized during an inventory search of a motor vehicle was admissible because the officer’s decision to impound the vehicle was based on legitimate caretaking concerns related solely to the purposes of an impoundment and thus, did not run afoul of the Constitution and because the inventory search, during which the officer opened four duffle bags found in the vehicle, was conducted in accordance with standardized procedures employed by the highway patrol.

        Police officer had probable cause to believe that paper contained illegal drugs and properly made a warrantless seizure of the paper for chemical testing where, pursuant to a valid inventory search conducted after defendant had been taken into custody for detoxification, police officer found a small piece of paper in defendant’s wallet that contained the same design as similar pieces of paper containing LSD that the officer had seen at a drug seminar, and a third party had informed the officer that defendant had come uninvited into her home, assaulted her, shown her a small piece of paper stating that it contained LSD, and the officer found the defendant unconscious in the third party’s home.

        District court erred in denying defendant’s motion to suppress evidence because his state and federal constitutional rights were violated where, while the criminal histories of defendant and his passenger were appropriately considered, the deputy who made the stop did not possess reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity to justify detaining and searching the vehicle after the traffic stop ended where, after eliminating the deputy’s speculation and untethered hunches, the only instance of nervous behavior was the passenger’s smoking upon the initial approach, the record lacked information supporting a guess that the route they were traveling was for an unlawful purpose.

        In a drug case, defendant was not illegally seized under the United States and North Dakota Constitutions since the length of a traffic stop was related to the officer's performance of his duties; he checked driver's licenses, checked for outstanding warrants, and spoke with two individuals about their trip. Approximately twelve minutes elapsed from the time of the stop to the time the officer was given consent to search the vehicle, and the driver was not issued a warning or citation before consent was given to search.

       <p>
        Because the purposes of the traffic stop had not been completed when the officer asked defendant if he had anything on him and if she could search him as the officer had not issued defendant a warning or a ticket, and defendant did not claim that the officer deliberately delayed the stop so a drug dog could arrive on the scene, the officer’s questions did not prolong or measurably extend the traffic stop.

        Defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied as the search was constitutionally reasonable because the search was supported by reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity by defendant’s roommate for failing to report to probation officers and authorized by a condition of probation subjecting the home to a warrantless search; and the discovery a scale in plain view in one of the bedrooms, which was linked to defendant, allowed the officers to expand the search during which the officers recovered several items of contraband, including paraphernalia, drugs and a firearm.

        Defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied because the deputy observed enough to give him a reasonable and articulable suspicion of actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol as, when defendant exited her vehicle, the deputy observed that she had difficulty maintaining her balance, her eyes were watery, and her speech was slurred; and, upon defendant’s entering the front passenger seat of the patrol vehicle, the deputy detected a strong odor of alcoholic beverages and felt that defendant seemed extremely confused when answering his initial questions.

        Deputies’ observations of defendant leaving a suspected house party, getting into a vehicle, and starting the engine, along with a deputy’s testimony that he could smell an odor of alcohol coming from defendant’s breath and that defendant had bloodshot, watery eyes and slurred speech, were sufficient to provide a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant had committed the offense of actual physical control while in the driveway, justifying further investigative detention. Moreover, defendant had voluntarily followed the deputies into the backyard, the house sitter had consented to the deputies’ entry into the house and back yard, and defendant’s voluntarily accompanying the deputies to the backyard did not remove the suspicion regarding his earlier action of getting into a vehicle and starting the engine.

I, § 8, the trial court improperly denied defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of the vehicle where there was no evidence of erratic driving or speeding, and the temporary registration sticker displayed on the vehicle pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.39.html#t39c39-04s39-04-17" target="_blank">39-04-17</a></cite> did not appear to be unusual. The officer had stopped the vehicle because, in his experience, many people drove on the sticker beyond the 30 days that was allotted; however, the officer’s belief that many people violated the 30-day temporary registration law was an over-generalization that did not give rise to reasonable suspicion that defendant’s automobile was not lawfully registered.

        Where a trooper observed defendant commit traffic violations by crossing the center and fog lines of a two-lane highway, there was a reasonable and articulable suspicion for initiating a traffic stop in a driving under the influence case. Moreover, the trooper’s onboard camera captured video images of such, corroborating the trooper’s testimony.

The trial court reasoned that the parties were moving and would have entered the 500-foot zone pretty quickly; thus, the investigative stop of defendant’s vehicle was constitutionally permissible, and her motion to suppress evidence was properly denied.

        Prior to executing a right or left turn upon a roadway, a driver must give an appropriate signal and must ascertain that the turn can be made with reasonable safety. Therefore, in a driving under the influence case, a motion to suppress evidence was properly denied since there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment or N.D. Const. art. I, § 8; an officer had the requisite grounds to make a valid investigative stop of a vehicle because defendant had violated N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.39.html#t39c39-10s39-10-38" target="_blank">39-10-38</a></cite>(1) by failing to signal a turn.

        Officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant’s vehicle, because the officer’s knowledge of the prior driver’s license suspension one month earlier was not too stale to support a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity, and the officer observed defendant operating a vehicle with no license plates and no viewable registration sticker.

        In a case involving a license suspension based on a driving under the influence (DUI) case, there was no violation of a licensee’s rights under the Fourth Amendment or N.D. Const. art. I, § 8; regardless of whether an officer’s initial encounter with the licensee in his front yard constituted a seizure, the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the licensee to investigate a citizen’s complaint regarding erratic driving based partially on the specific description of the car and the fact that the citizen followed the car and waited until police arrived. Further, the officer had probable cause to arrest the licensee for DUI where the licensee failed sobriety tests, had bloodshot and glassy eyes, and admitted to drinking.

        In a DUI case, denial of defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop was proper because the vehicle, without license plates and only with an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper in the rear window, provided a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify stopping the vehicle; the officer did not recognize the sheet of paper as an authentic temporary registration certificate, from the state or another state, and thus he had reasonable grounds to stop the driver and check if the driver had a valid temporary registration certificate in his possession in accordance with state law.

        Trial court erred in granting defendant’s motion to suppress all evidence obtained from a traffic stop where a first police officer’s uncorroborated communication that defendant was intoxicated, together with a second officer’s observation of defendant driving, was sufficient to establish reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop defendant’s vehicle.

        When a patrol officer testified that he clocked a driver traveling at 36 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour zone, the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop the driver. It was not necessary to provide evidence that the radar was working properly or that the officer was certified to operate the radar device.

        When a deputy sheriff responded to a call that people were causing a disturbance at a bar, he approached the only vehicle in the parking lot without activating his red lights and spoke to the driver; a seizure did not occur when the deputy requested that the driver unlock the door and exit the pickup. After the deputy noticed that the driver’s eyes were bloodshot and that he was slurring his speech, the driver’s rights under N.D. Const. art.

        In a murder case, the stop of defendant was proper because officers had reasonable suspicion; the stop occurred within minutes of the fight and stabbing incidents being reported, the vehicle was located in a private elementary school parking lot and was not merely passing through, there were no other vehicles in the area at the time, dispatch notified the officers that a black male was seen leaving the scene, and both officers observed a black male in the passenger seat who matched the description of the suspect.

        Warrantless search of defendants’
   vehicle was proper under the officer safety exception where an officer testified that after defendants were ordered out of the vehicle, he could not see inside the pickup to determine if there were any other occupants, the incident occurred at night, and the pickup had tinted windows and sat high off the ground. Under those circumstances, defendants’
   right to be free from unreasonable search was not infringed when the officers opened the door of the vehicle to determine if there were any other occupants in the vehicle.

        Where the narcotics task force received a tip claiming that a probationer would be selling methamphetamine to defendant and they removed defendant from the probationer’s vehicle, the initial pat-down search of defendant was constitutionally permissible because it was based on officer safety; however, after the search of the probationer and his car produced no evidence of weapons, the continued seizure of defendant violated N.D. Const. art. I, § 8’s prohibition against unreasonable seizure and this warranted the application of the exclusionary rule for any evidence the officers obtained following the unlawful seizure.

        Law enforcement officers were not justified in executing a protective sweep of a residence. The officers’

        While a patdown may often be reasonable for safety, the following pocket search must also be based on the same safety reasons. They are distinct efforts. To proceed without a warrant or an arrest, each must be reasonable. State v. Zearley, 444 N.W.2d 353, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       <p>
        In a tense situation of entering a house where suspected drug activity may be happening, the officer may not be able to adequately and quickly assess the hazards before a patdown and that is why the patdown of defendant was reasonable but the reasonableness of a patdown, without more, does not make a pocket search reasonable since a patdown is not simply a routine preliminary to a more extensive search and before going further, the officer must have an articulable and reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous. State v. Zearley, 444 N.W.2d 353, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        Where an outside clothing pat-down search reveals the presence of an object of a size and density that reasonably suggests the object might be a weapon, the searching officer is entitled to continue the search to the inner garments where the object is located in order to determine whether the object is in fact a weapon. State v. Zearley, 468 N.W.2d 391, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>
        An officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the defendant was armed and dangerous when, during a pat-down search, he felt an object which he thought was a knife. Thereafter, executing a pocket search was reasonable and the items found in defendant’s pocket were admissible evidence. State v. Zearley, 468 N.W.2d 391, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        Defendant’s repeatedly reaching into the pockets and waistband of his jeans, even after being told not to do so, gave the officer an articulable suspicion that he might be armed and dangerous and a protective patdown for weapons was warranted to ensure the officer’s safety; when the object in defendant’s pocket was of a size and density to reasonably suggest it was a weapon, the officer was entitled to take the action necessary to confirm that it was not. State v. Tollefson, 2003 ND 73, 660 N.W.2d 575, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        When defendant, a minor, was searched by a police officer just before entering a hockey game, and two cans of beer were found, a trial court should have granted defendant’s motion to suppress because a blanket, suspicionless search of everyone entering the sports arena was unreasonable, especially when the officer did not suspect defendant was carrying a weapon; the fact that two governors were attending the game, and the fear of terrorism, did not justify the search.

       <p>
        Trial court erred in holding that a pat-down search was proper because the court made no findings of fact as to whether there was reasonable suspicion or whether defendant consented to the search; for purposes of the Fourth Amendment and N.D. Const. Art. I, § 8, the speeding violation was a sufficient reason for the officer to stop the vehicle, order defendant out of his vehicle, and have him sit in the patrol vehicle but the officer was not justified in conducting a pat-down search before placing defendant in the patrol car and, although there was testimony indicating that defendant seemed very nervous and fidgety and avoided eye contact while in his car, the trial court made no findings as to these facts and reached no conclusion as to whether the facts gave rise to a reasonable suspicion.

        When a pat-down search revealed objects in defendant’s pocket but where the objects were not of a size and density that suggested that the objects might be weapons or anything that might be used to harm the police, a subsequent pocket search was improper, and defendant’s motion to suppress the drug paraphernalia discovered should have been granted.

        Officers had already taken one six and three-quarter inch knife from defendant and thus it was reasonable under the circumstances for the officers to believe that the bulge in defendant’s pocket, the container in question, might had been another weapon, as the container was large enough to hold another weapon, defendant would not tell the officers what was in the container, and thus one officer opened the container to see if there was any kind of weapon in it; under the circumstances, the officer’s opening of the container was reasonable and this did not violate defendant’s constitutional rights, the contraband discovered was the fruit of a legal frisk or pat-down search, and thus the trial court erred in granting the motion to suppress as to the container evidence.

        Defendant’s motion to suppress was improperly denied as the police officer’s invasive search of defendant’s person violated her constitutional rights because the officer did not have reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was armed and dangerous after conducting the outside clothing pat-down, justifying a more intrusive search, as the officer testified she felt a large, soft bulge inside defendant’s bra while conducting the pat-down; the officer testified it did not feel like anything hard, metallic, or similar to a weapon, gun, or knife; and the officer did not testify she was concerned that defendant was armed and dangerous at the time of the search of her person.

        Condition of probation requiring probationer to submit to a search by police officers or probation officers without a warrant and without probable cause or even a reasonable suspicion that the probationer is engaging in criminal activities or violating a condition of his probation does not violate Fourth Amendment rights to the extent such a search contributes to the rehabilitation process; is not used as a subterfuge for criminal investigations; and is performed in a reasonable manner.

        Where, under the totality of circumstances, defendant’s probation officer had a reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaging in unlawful activity, the searches did not violate the Fourth Amendment; the court overruled the portion of State v. Perbix, 331 N.W.2d 14 (N.D. 1983), requiring that the purpose of a probationary search be considered when deciding the validity of a probationary search and the court determined that it would no longer consider whether the search was conducted as a subterfuge for a criminal investigation.

        District court did not err in denying a probationer's motion to suppress evidence found on his cell phones where the conditions of his probation included allowing police officers to search the cell phones located inside his residence as part of the probation search, his girlfriend informed officers that he had uploaded pictures of clothed, young girls in provocative positions to his cell phones, and thus, the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct a warrantless search of the cell phones.

        Trial court erred by granting defendant’s motion to suppress because his supervised probation conditions included a search clause, and a child’s statement alluding to the presence of drugs in the residence to officers during the initial officer safety sweep provided reasonable suspicion that unlawful activity was afoot. The court held that defendant remained on probation and subject to the conditions of probation while he was in custody until such time as his probation was terminated or revoked. State v.

        In determining whether an unreasonable search has occurred, the court must consider the nature and the extent of the householder’s interest in, and the privacy of, the area into which the officers went without a warrant, including its proximity to the actual dwelling of defendant, and whether the place searched was within the curtilage of the occupant.

        Police had probable cause to arrest defendant at the time of the pocket search and, when viewed objectively, had placed him under arrest by the time of the search; the search was therefore justified as a search performed incident to the arrest. Upon seeing the methamphetamine paraphernalia in plain view in the automobile, the officers had probable cause to believe that some drug-related crime was either committed or attempted; therefore, police had the authority to arrest the responsible parties without a warrant, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence.

        Defendant’s confession made after an illegal police custodial interrogation conducted after an illegal seizure of his person was not obtained as a result of an exploitation of the illegal police conduct, and was therefore not inadmissible as “fruit of the poisonous tree”, where the time lapse between the illegal police conduct and the confession was approximately 22 hours, during which time defendant was allowed to go home with his parents; there was no police conduct toward defendant during the 22-hour intervening time period; and the police officers were not guilty of flagrant and malicious misconduct.

        Evidence of drugs and drug paraphernalia found in searches subsequent to an illegal search of a hotel room and gym bag need not be suppressed where officers’ initial illegal search was not the “but for” cause of the officers’ later search of the vehicle driven by the defendants and the independent source exception also applied. State v. Gregg, 2000 ND 154, 615 N.W.2d 515, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 2000).

        Officer’s warrantless search of defendant’s jacket outside the doorway of a private home violated defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure; the search was not a permissible inspection to identify the owner of personal property, because the circumstances did not justify an inference that the jacket was stolen, lost, or abandoned, and there was no claim the officer’s search was based upon probable cause to believe the jacket contained evidence of criminal activity. State v. Dunn, 2002 ND 189, 653 N.W.2d 688, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        District court erred in finding that defendant voluntarily consented to law enforcement officers’
   entry into his motel room where four officers appeared at the motel room door with their weapons drawn, they yelled and ordered the occupants to come out with their hands up, and the officers asked if they could come into the room before ordering defendant to the ground; although the district court found legitimate safety concerns justifying the officers’
   use of weapons, that fact was not relevant in deciding whether consent was voluntary. However, defendant’s statement to the police subsequently made at the police station could not be considered the product of the unlawful entry into the motel room and fruit of the poisonous tree; because there was probable cause to arrest defendant, the statements he made during the interrogation at the police station were not the product of the illegal entry, and the exclusionary rule did not bar the State’s use of those statements. The district court therefore did not err in denying defendant’s motion to suppress.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied where officer seized evidence of drugs from defendant’s residence during the execution of a warrant issued without probable cause; the officer believed he was acting pursuant to a validly issued warrant, and the seized evidence was admitted. State v. Dodson, 2003 ND 187, 671 N.W.2d 825, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply because the search warrant was based on an affidavit lacking in probable cause indicia rendering official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable where the officer’s affidavit supplied no more than a tenuous and conclusory suggestion that defendant was involved in criminal activity, as it was based on stale information from an uncorroborated confidential informant who was part of the criminal milieu, it provided no time-frame for alleged transactions and did not establish that contraband would be found in the defendant’s residence. State v. Lunde, 2008 ND 142, 752 N.W.2d 630, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 2008).

        Although the State argued the district court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress because officers relied in good faith on the district court’s amended bond order, the imposition of a warrantless search provision in a bond order was too remote a circumstance to be compared to a probable cause determination resulting in a search warrant.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial court committed harmless error in allowing the introduction of illegally obtained evidence that was neither an element of the crime with which the defendant was charged nor was convincing on its face that the charged crime had been committed, where the remaining evidence overwhelmingly tended to indicate the defendant’s guilt. State v. Howe, 182 N.W.2d 658 (N.D. 1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 933, 91 S. Ct. 2261, 29 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1971), distinguished, State v. Matthews, 216 N.W.2d 90, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

         Inevitable Discovery Doctrine.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The inevitable-discovery theory, which theory establishes that evidence derived from information obtained in an unlawful search is not inadmissible under the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine where it is shown that the evidence would have been gained even without the unlawful action, is a part of North Dakota law as a necessary corollary and exception to the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine and the exclusionary rule; to apply the inevitable-discovery theory the state must meet a two-part test; first, use of the doctrine is permitted only when the police have not acted in bad faith to accelerate the discovery of the evidence in question; and second, the state must prove that the evidence would have been found without the unlawful activity and must show how the discovery of the evidence would have occurred. State v. Phelps, 297 N.W.2d 769, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 291</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a drug case, district court failed to make specific findings of fact as to whether a police officer acted in bad faith as required under the first part of the inevitable discovery test when searching beyond the scope of the consent to search; however, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that contraband found in defendant's suitcase would have inevitably been discovered after the suitcase was searched without his consent, satisfying the second part of the inevitable discovery test.
   State v. Asbach, 2015 ND 280, 871 N.W.2d 820, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 275</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if warrantless entry into a home to make a felony arrest was unlawful, evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant was admissible under the inevitable discovery doctrine where at the time of the entry and arrest the search warrant was in the process of being obtained, no information concerning anything the police found when they entered the home was relayed to the officer who was making the affidavit for the search warrant, and all relevant information necessary for the search warrant was independently in the hands of the officer seeking the warrant prior to the entry by the other officers. State v. Nagel, 308 N.W.2d 539, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 318</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The inevitable discovery doctrine could not be applied to validate an illegal search based upon an assumption that a subsequent search conducted pursuant to a hypothetical search warrant would have resulted in the discovery of the disputed evidence. State v. Handtmann, 437 N.W.2d 830, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the district court subsequently found that the circumstances argued by the state were not actually exigent, so as to permit officers to arrest individual who had just sold drugs to an informant in his home, without a warrant, where the testimony presented to the court would have allowed it to conclude that the officers were merely mistaken in their belief of exigent circumstances, that they were not entering the apartment to collect evidence in bad faith, that the only reason the police entered the apartment was to detain a defendant until agent could arrive with a search warrant, and that the officers did not specifically conduct a search for evidence while in the apartment, and where the evidence seized would have inevitably been discovered pursuant to the subsequently issued warrant, the district court did not err in applying the inevitable discovery doctrine so as to deny defendant’s motion to suppress. State v. Wahl, 450 N.W.2d 710, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 9</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court did not explicitly find that the officers would have sought a warrant if they had not earlier entered defendant’s garage without a warrant, the case was remanded to the trial court for a determination of whether the officers’ decision to seek the warrant was caused by what they saw during their unlawful entry. State v. Winkler, 552 N.W.2d 347, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inevitable discovery doctrine was properly applied to the deceased body found in a burned home where the police officers' entry into the home was limited to just inside the threshold and to confirm the presence of the dead body, as reported by the firefighters, and they acted in good faith by immediately leaving the home and applying for a search warrant. State v. Friesz, 2017 ND 177, 898 N.W.2d 688, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        Where defendants charged with conspiracy to possess and deliver a controlled substance had no expectation of privacy in the motel room of another codefendant who had pleaded guilty, the defendants did not have standing to object to a search of the codefendant’s motel room; it is no longer desirable to continue the automatic-standing rule, which gave a defendant charged with crimes of possession based upon possession of seized goods automatic standing to challenge the legality of the search which produced the evidence against him.

        Defendant was not entitled to suppress evidence when police officers found defendant nonresponsive and in the driver’s seat of a parked vehicle as an officer was acting within the community caretaker exception when the officer requested defendant step out of the vehicle and the seizure of defendant when defendant exited the vehicle was appropriate as officers had reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol based on the odor of alcohol and defendant’s poor balance.

        There is no plain and unequivocal language in the second sentence of this section which says that no suits can be brought against the state without authorization by the legislature, or that only the legislature can modify or waive the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity. Much more specific and unequivocal language than the permissive language in the second sentence of this section is required to defeat the important substantive rights plainly guaranteed by the first sentence.

        Employee had an opportunity to present her evidence and she summarized what was said during the recorded conversations and other witnesses agreed with her summary; she did not object to the appeals referee’s decision not to include the tapes in the record, and the appeals referee did not err by failing to admit the tapes and the employee was not denied a fair hearing.

        In a driver’s license revocation proceeding, a licensee was unable to establish that her due process rights had been violated based on certain comments made by a hearing officer that showed impatience with counsel’s objections. This was not a sufficient basis for showing that the hearing officer was biased.

        Due process clause required that the North Dakota State Board of Law Examiners employ fair procedures in processing applications for admission to the bar and that a fair and impartial tribunal was a basic tenet of due process; although the record did not demonstrate intentional unethical behavior, on the facts presented, the board chairperson’s impartiality could reasonably have been questioned, and reasonable minds might have found an appearance of impropriety.

        A requirement for reasonable court fees will be sustained, and is not unconstitutional as being a denial or sale of justice, provided that the fee is reasonable, is uniform in its application, and has some reasonable connection with the services rendered. Malin v. La Moure County, 27 N.D. 140, 145 N.W. 582, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1914).

        Chapter 119, S.L. 1919, providing graduated fees for the county court was invalid. Malin v. La Moure County, 27 N.D. 140, 145 N.W. 582, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is aimed not merely against bribery and the direct selling of justice by magistrates and officials, but against the unreasonable restraints upon and charges for the use of the courts. Malin v. La Moure County, 27 N.D. 140, 145 N.W. 582, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1914).

        Where corruption of the trial court by bribery is shown to exist, it just as effectively terminates the power of the court to proceed in the matter before him as in the case of the filing of an affidavit of prejudice.

The magistrate’s focus on dispensing with the evidentiary hearing in his case could have been viewed as subtle coercion; therefore, the husband did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his right to the hearing.

        North Dakota Department of Transportation violated plaintiff’s right to due process at a license suspension hearing when it took the arresting officer’s testimony telephonically without notice under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-35" target="_blank">28-32-35</a></cite>; the hearing officer could not see the police officer to judge his demeanor or determine if he was testifying from notes. The officer was also unable to diagram the roadway where the stop occurred or demonstrate how he conducted the field sobriety test; this led to an unfair hearing.

        Doctor, whose license to practice medicine was revoked by the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners, had no due process right to a face-to-face confrontation with the Board.
   Jones v. N.D. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs - Investigative Panel B, 2005 ND 22, 691 N.W.2d 251, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In medical disciplinary proceedings, the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners was the ultimate fact finder and consisted mostly of physicians who were trained and experienced in the profession, which, coupled with the procedural safeguards envisioned by the medical disciplinary procedural statutes, minimized the risk of error. Thus, the preponderance of evidence standard for medical disciplinary proceedings satisfied due process.

       </p>
       <p>
        Doctor’s right to due process was not violated during medical board disciplinary proceedings where one of the investigators for the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners had an alleged personal and financial conflict of interest in the case, because the statutory scheme for the Board and its investigative panels precluded Board members, like the investigator who served on an investigative panel, from participating in adjudicatory proceedings before the Board on that complaint. The statutory scheme for the Board’s investigative panels, coupled with the other statutory procedures for adjudication by the Board, provided adequate procedural safeguards to satisfy the requirements for due process, and the investigator’s participation in the investigation of the complaints did not violate due process and, therefore, the district court did not err in deciding the Board did not violate the doctor’s due process or equal protection rights.

       <p>
        District court’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over a Montana bank was constitutionally impermissible where the bank’s conduct and connection with North Dakota were not such that it should reasonably have anticipated being haled into court there; although the bank occasionally loaned money to North Dakota customers, it did not solicit customers in North Dakota, the loans were originated in Montana, and the bank had no physical presence in North Dakota. The bank’s limited contacts with North Dakota were not sufficiently continuous and systematic to justify the exercise of general personal jurisdiction, and the loans the bank made to North Dakota customers did not support specific personal jurisdiction. Ensign v. Bank of Baker, 2004 ND 56, 676 N.W.2d 786, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a suit brought against a Colorado law firm by a North Dakota attorney to enforce a purported fee sharing contract, there were insufficient contacts with North Dakota to support personal jurisdiction over the law firm where the contract, if there was one, was entered into in Colorado, the underlying case was filed in Colorado, and all of the depositions, preparation of interrogatories and witnesses, and representation of the clients during the settlement conference and arbitration had been conducted in Colorado. The exercise of personal jurisdiction would have offended traditional notions of justice and fair play under the concept of due process.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Governmental immunity from tort liability to individual citizens is abolished; governmental bodies, other than the state government, are subject to suit for damages by individuals injured by the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of their agents and employees in the execution of activity; and no distinction is retained between governmental and proprietary functions. Kitto v. Minot Park Dist., 224 N.W.2d 795 (N.D. 1974), overruled in part, Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr. Co., 521 N.W.2d 632 (N.D. 1994). But see, Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr.

       <p>
        The state was the real party in interest, the action was not an action arising upon contract for which sovereign immunity has been waived under N.D.C.C. §
   <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.32.html#t32c32-12s32-12-02" target="_blank">32-12-02</a></cite>, and state could constitutionally raise sovereign immunity as a bar to plaintiff’s action where plaintiff brought action against state official in his official capacity only alleging direct causes of action under the federal and state constitutions and 42 USCS § 1983, claiming that failure to renew his position as branch manager of a state motor vehicle branch office was because of his political party affiliation and in violation of his constitutional and civil rights. Kristensen v. Strinden, 343 N.W.2d 67, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 438</cite> (N.D. 1983).

        Nothing in this section elevates the common-law doctrine of sovereign immunity to constitutional status, or precludes the state supreme court from abolishing that common-law doctrine. Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr. Co., 521 N.W.2d 632, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 202</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Abolition of the state’s sovereign immunity from tort liability does not impose tort liability on the state for the exercise of discretionary acts in its official capacity, including legislative, judicial, quasi-legislative, and quasi-judicial functions. Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr. Co., 521 N.W.2d 632, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 202</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>
        Because most of the motions, pleadings, letters and other documents a child’s father filed were frivolous and unsupported by good faith arguments, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding the father a vexatious litigant and limiting his access to the court. Although the father’s access to the court had been restricted, the father retained reasonable access to the court system through a pre-filing order requiring him to obtain leave of a judge. Smith v.

       <p>
        The allowance of a claim against the workmen’s compensation fund which acts as a bar to the claimant’s common-law recovery does not contravene the provisions of this section. Ethen v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 62 N.D. 394, 244 N.W. 32, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1932).

       <p>
        If a workers’
   compensation claimant’s due process rights are violated when he receives a notice that does not adequately set forth workforce safety and insurance’s (WSI) theories and evidence supporting termination of benefits because it deprives him of the opportunity to meaningfully respond, then certainly the failure to receive any notice at all, which completely deprives the claimant of any opportunity to respond or to seek a hearing, is also a denial of due process.
   Rojas v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2005 ND 147, 703 N.W.2d 299, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an ALJ and workforce safety and insurance (WSI) found that a claimant had never received the mailed notice of intention to discontinue/reduce his benefits (NOID), WSI’s termination of his ongoing disability benefits violated due process as he had not received prior notice or an opportunity to respond and his benefits were reinstated as of the date of their termination.

        One charged with murder is not entitled to bail as a strict legal right, if the proof of guilt is evident or the presumption thereof is great. State v. Hartzell, 13 N.D. 356, 100 N.W. 745, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 47</cite> (N.D. 1904).

        Penalties assessed against a waste hauler for dumping produced saltwater on a public road were not excessive under N.D. Const. art.

        Imprisonment in the state penitentiary for three years, upon a conviction for grand larceny, is not a “cruel and unusual punishment”. State v. Jochim, 55 N.D. 313, 213 N.W. 484, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1927).

        “Cruel” as applied to punishment for crime, refers to the form of punishment, and “unusual” refers to its frequency. State v. Kingen, 58 N.D. 327, 226 N.W. 505, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1929).

        Reviewing court overruled defendant’s assertion that the charges should be dismissed since the county jail where he was held before trial was unable to effectively meet his physical and medical needs in violation of the cruel and unusual punishment clauses of the state and federal constitutions, because defendant had not established systemic disregard of the law, when defendant was allowed access to his support hose and blood pressure checks upon request, plastic chairs for the shower and extra mattresses for the bed were made available, and defendant did not claim inmates in general had their medical needs overlooked by jail staff.

        Where state filed warrant of arrest as detainer against accused imprisoned in neighboring state prison and made reasonable efforts in good faith to extradite him for trial, accused’s petition to withdraw the detainer because he had not been granted speedy trial was dismissed, since delay was caused by inaction of neighboring state officials and not bad faith or lack of diligence by North Dakota officials.

       <p>
        A ten-month delay between arraignment and trial for murder did not deprive defendant of his constitutional right to a speedy trial where the delay was due to appropriate and necessary pretrial preparations, continuances requested by defendant, an appeal by the state of a suppression order, and defendant did not show how the delay hampered his defense. State v. Dilger, 338 N.W.2d 87, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 373</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Factors to be assessed in determining whether a defendant has been deprived of his right to a speedy trial are length of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant’s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. State v. Dilger, 338 N.W.2d 87, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 373</cite> (N.D. 1983).

        The right to a speedy trial does not attach until a defendant in some way becomes an accused; which can come about by a formal indictment or information or by the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge. State v. Denny, 350 N.W.2d 25, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 432</cite> (N.D. 1984).

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s improper attempts to invoke Interstate Agreement on Detainers did not constitute a proper request for a speedy trial, much of the delay was attributable to motions filed by the defendant, and the defendant did not demonstrate that his ability to defend against charges was impaired by the delay. State v. Moe, 1998 ND 137, 581 N.W.2d 468, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s right to a speedy trial was not violated where he failed to inform the district court of his change of address when he was transported from another county, failed to object when hearings were rescheduled, failed to request immediate disposition of the charges during his preliminary hearings, and failed to follow the procedural requirements of the Uniform Mandatory Disposition of Detainers Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 29-33. State v. Johnson, 1999 ND 33, 590 N.W.2d 192, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        North Dakota Supreme Court encourages an analysis of each factor under Barker v. Wingo, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 407 U.S. 514, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101 (1972) when analyzing a speedy trial claim. It regards none of the four factors identified above as either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial; these factors have no talismanic qualities, but courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process.

       <p>
        State’s delays of about eight months and twelve or thirteen months between the commission of the offense and commencement of prosecution did not violate defendants’ due process rights where the delays were caused by the need to continue an investigation in the hope others would be arrested, the prosecutions were commenced within the limits of the statute of limitations, and the defendants did not establish any prejudice resulting from the delays. State v. Denny, 350 N.W.2d 25, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 432</cite> (N.D. 1984); State v. Denny, 351 N.W.2d 102, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 328</cite> (N.D. 1984).

        Defendant’s due process rights were not violated by a ten-month delay between sale of marijuana to an undercover policeman and defendant’s arrest and prosecution for that offense where delay was attributed to necessity for continued investigation to determine source of defendant’s marijuana and there was no showing of any wrongful delay by state or evidence of any prejudice to defendant. State v. Weisz, 356 N.W.2d 462, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 399</cite> (N.D. 1984).

        Defendant was not deprived of his speedy trial rights under the United States or North Dakota Constitutions because the reason for the delay was precipitated by defendant's act of effectively firing his first counsel; the extent of the delay involved reasonable scheduling considerations for an anticipated five-day jury trial and the designation of a second court-appointed counsel.
   State v. Owens, 2015 ND 68, 860 N.W.2d 817, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        One who has been committed for trial on a criminal charge, not admitted to bail, and not brought to trial at or before the second term of court subsequent to his commitment will not be released when the delay of trial was upon application of the prisoner.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s federal and state constitutional speedy trial rights were not violated because the delay was not more than one year, was not presumptively prejudicial, and the reasons for the delay involved defendant’s decisions about court-appointed counsel and representing himself, his failure to comply with appropriate procedures for making a motion, and his request for more time to make a motion, and the record did not reflect that defendant requested an evidentiary hearing on his motion to dismiss, or took steps to secure a time for the hearing. State v. Hamre, 2019 ND 86, 924 N.W.2d 776, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial by a postponement and rescheduling of trial date at state’s request where defendant had requested and received a postponement and rescheduling both before and after the state’s request. State v. Goetz, 312 N.W.2d 1, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 421</cite> (N.D. 1981), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 924, 102 S. Ct. 1286, 71 L. Ed. 2d 467, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 728 (U.S. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the defendant’s trial was delayed for about two years, there was no evidence that the State purposefully delayed the trial, and defendant moved to suppress evidence from the searches about 400 days after pre-trial motions were due; defendant did not satisfy the appellate court that his speedy trial rights were violated by the delay in bringing his case to trial.

        Actual prejudice to defendant from delay was not apparent where he was in jail for separate convictions much of the time before his trial; almost seven months of his incarceration was unrelated to the case at bar, and “oppressive pretrial incarceration” did not occur.

        Defendant was not denied his right to speedy trial where, although eight months passed between the date of defendant’s arrest and the commencement of his trial, considering the appointments of counsel and various intervening motions that were filed, defendant’s actions reasonably attributed to the delay and there was no actual prejudice to him by the delay. State v. Ochoa, 2004 ND 43, 675 N.W.2d 161, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        There was no speedy trial violation under N.D.R.Crim.P. 48(b), N.D. Const. art. I, § 12, or the Sixth Amendment based on a three-year delay between a driving under the influence citation and an arrest since both parties were responsible for some of the delay (defendant failed to appear, and the State negligently failed to serve a warrant), defendant failed to assert the right when first arrested on a warrant, and he failed to show actual prejudice since the only evidence that he would have offered would have been a cross-examination of the arresting officer.

        Reasonably administered, the denial of a continuance upon stipulation by the state to what an absent witness, if present, would testify, does not work a denial of the defendant’s right to process to compel attendance of the witness in behalf of the accused.

        Defendant, who was convicted of theft, was not deprived of his right to compulsory process when standby counsel and the trial court did not assist defendant in securing the testimony of several governmental agents, including FBI agents and agents from the Department of Homeland Security; the record was devoid of any showing by defendant that these witnesses would have provided favorable and material testimony to aid defendant’s defense to the theft charge.

        There was no reversible error in limiting defendant’s cross-examination concerning the financial condition of witness who was owner of tavern that was subject of burglary; defendant introduced no evidence to show participation by witness in the crime due to financial stress and, under the circumstances of this case, the questions regarding the financial condition of witness and her business could only act to unfairly prejudice or impeach her testimony.

        Defendant’s right to confront a witness against him was satisfied where, despite not having the witness’ address to conduct a background investigation into her character and reputation for truthfulness, defendant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the witness at both deposition and trial regarding her past criminal convictions, her continued drug use, her time spent as a fugitive and, to the extent the witness’ character and reputation could be impeached, the defendant did so.

        The right to counsel under North Dakota’s constitution is fundamental because it enables an accused to procure a fair trial. This special regard for the intrinsic value of this section has been exercised independently of any compulsion under federal law or the federal constitution. State v. Orr, 375 N.W.2d 171, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 409</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        The explanatory note to Rule 44, NDRCrP, which states that counsel would be appointed only when required under the holding of the United States Supreme Court in Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U.S. 25, 92 S. Ct. 2006, 32 L. Ed. 2d 530 (1972), does not indicate any intention that in North Dakota the right to counsel guaranteed by this section is to be limited by or to holdings of the United States Supreme Court. State v. Orr, 375 N.W.2d 171, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 409</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Postconviction relief was denied because an applicant did not establish that he received ineffective assistance of counsel under the United States and North Dakota Constitutions during a change of plea hearing; trial counsel's failure to seek a recess to provide further explanation to the applicant was not second guessed on appeal.

       </p>
       <p>
        Despite defendant’s contentions that his first conference with his court-appointed counsel was just moments before the case went to trial, that counsel was appointed only two days before that time, and that counsel was not given time to investigate and prepare for his defense, defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel where he had had court-appointed counsel prior to counsel’s withdrawal and where the trial court had taken judicial notice of the competence of appointed counsel at trial. State v. Rudolph, 193 N.W.2d 237, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>

        A holding by the U. S. Court of Appeals, 491 F.2d 687, abandons the “farce and mockery” test on the effectiveness of counsel for testing Sixth Amendment claims. State v. Bragg, 221 N.W.2d 793, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is more effectively presented in a post-conviction-relief proceeding than an appeal because the court in those proceedings is the court before which the trial was held. State v. Ricehill, 415 N.W.2d 481, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 436</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the substance of an absent witness’s testimony could be determined only from representations of counsel, unsupported by evidence, the supreme court was unable, on direct appeal of a conviction, to determine whether counsel was ineffective for failing to subpoena the witness in time to assure his appearance at trial. State v. Ricehill, 415 N.W.2d 481, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 436</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a two-part test for allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel. First, a defendant must show that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Second, the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A defendant must demonstrate both deficient representation by counsel and prejudice caused by the deficient representation. Woehlhoff v. State, 487 N.W.2d 16, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Our state and federal constitutions guarantee criminal defendants the right to reasonably effective assistance of counsel; consequently, ineffective assistance of counsel is one ground for relief from a criminal conviction under the post-conviction procedure act. Woehlhoff v. State, 487 N.W.2d 16, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Defendant’s attorney was not incompetent regarding jury instructions, plea bargaining, witnesses, and testing of a pair of pantyhose where his decisions were based on strategic and tactical considerations. Stoppleworth v. State, 501 N.W.2d 325, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the record on appeal is not adequate concerning defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the record does not affirmatively show defendant’s trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective, the defendant may pursue the claim at a post-conviction proceeding where an adequate record can be developed. State v. Falcon, 546 N.W.2d 835, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants are discouraged from bringing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel directly from the district court, because, unless the record affirmatively shows ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions, defendant must show some form of proof, and without a record scrutinizing the reasons underlying counsel’s conduct, adjudging that conduct subpart is virtually impossible. State v. Touche, 549 N.W.2d 193, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>

        In direct appeal from trial court in which defendant contended ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant did not affirmatively show ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions, where counsel did not request instruction on lesser included offense, failed to object to use of the word “rape” by prosecution while questioning victim, and did not file a motion about prior sexual experience of victim. State v. McDonell, 550 N.W.2d 62, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant first raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal of his conviction and trial court summarily affirmed the conviction without expressly denying the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the denial was without prejudice and defendant could raise the issue in post-conviction proceedings affording the possibility of an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Moreover, because there was a reasonable inference of ineffective representation, defendant was entitled to a hearing. DeCoteau v. State, 1998 ND 199, 586 N.W.2d 156, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the record was inadequate for defendant to establish that his trial counsel’s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness or that it was reasonably probable the result of his trial would have been different but for his counsel’s alleged errors, defendant could still pursue this claim in a post-conviction proceeding in which an adequate record supporting his contentions could be developed. State v. Strutz, 2000 ND 22, 606 N.W.2d 886, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 19</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defense counsel’s failure to confer with his client regarding submitting to the jury lesser included offenses to aggravated assault did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, but rather amounted to a reasoned decision based on trial strategy. Mathre v. State, 2000 ND 201, 619 N.W.2d 627, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in dismissing defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel regarding his guilty plea, where defendant failed to provide any evidentiary support for his allegations, evidence contradicting his allegations was presented at the post-conviction hearing and defendant could have received a substantially greater sentence at trial had he not plead guilty. Damron v. State, 2003 ND 102, 663 N.W.2d 650, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       <p>
        When inmate’s attorney testified that the inmate had indicated his desire not to appeal three times, the appellate court upheld the trial court’s determination that the testimony was more credible than that of the inmate and his witness, and denied the inmate’s petition for post conviction relief. Kamara v. State, 2003 ND 179, 671 N.W.2d 811, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       <p>
        In a case related to stalking and theft, petitioner failed to show counsel was ineffective regarding suppression of the evidence obtained during a search, advice regarding the consequences of his guilty plea, or advice regarding sentencing; therefore, his guilty plea was not involuntary and his petition for post-conviction relief was properly denied. Ernst v. State, 2004 ND 152, 683 N.W.2d 891, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 278</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness when, after calling the defense witnesses to the stand and discovering that they had not complied with a defense-requested sequestration order, he made no offer of proof as to the substance of their testimony, despite that testimony being critical to corroborating defendant’s only proffered defense. Heckelsmiller v. State, 2004 ND 191, 687 N.W.2d 454, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 313</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, had to show the representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have differed; the record did not establish whether not stipulating to the conviction before trial and not objecting to character witnesses were part of the legitimate trial strategy or ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court could not determine whether the attorney’s conduct fell below the accepted standard of reasonableness and the issue was more properly pursued in a post-conviction relief proceeding.
   State v. Hayek, 2004 ND 211, 689 N.W.2d 422, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 359</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel was not ineffective in his investigation of defendant’s case for failure to interview two important witnesses where there was substantial other evidence implicating defendant in the crimes and defendant admitted to committing the crimes.
   Greywind v. State, 2004 ND 213, 689 N.W.2d 390, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 356</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that trial counsel’s failure to move to suppress evidence of drugs and drug paraphernalia found during a search of defendant’s motel room after he was arrested pursuant to a warrant was not ineffective assistance of counsel because there were outstanding bench warrants for defendant’s arrest for failure to appear at the time of the arrest and search and it was these warrants that were executed not the arrest warrant issued two days following defendant’s arrest when defendant was separately charged with the crime of failure to appear.
   State v. Steen, 2004 ND 228, 690 N.W.2d 239, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 373</cite> (N.D. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 853, 126 S. Ct. 117, 163 L. Ed. 2d 126, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 6923 (U.S. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel at his preliminary hearing where he requested assistance of counsel at his initial appearance but was not represented by counsel at the preliminary hearing because he had not submitted documents showing indigency, nevertheless, he objected to a continuance and proceeded to represent himself at that hearing. Defendant waived the issue of whether he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the original preliminary hearing because he received a second preliminary hearing at which he was represented by counsel, and he thereafter continued to be represented by counsel at all stages of the prosecution against him. State v. Murchison, 2004 ND 193, 687 N.W.2d 725, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 323</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s claim that trial counsel was deficient when he failed to object to defendant appearing at the jury trial wearing prison clothing and by failing to arrange for defendant to wear normal attire failed where the post-conviction court’s ability to assess the prejudicial effect of defendant’s attire was hampered by his failure to provide a transcript of the trial to the post-conviction court.
   A defendant’s appearance at trial in prison attire does not automatically vitiate a conviction and defendant must have shown not only that counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, but must have also demonstrated prejudice by establishing a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel’s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.
   State v. Steen, 2004 ND 228, 690 N.W.2d 239, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 373</cite> (N.D. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 853, 126 S. Ct. 117, 163 L. Ed. 2d 126, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 6923 (U.S. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant argued that he received ineffective assistance of counsel by virtue of his trial counsel’s failure to request dismissal of the entire jury panel based upon a venireperson’s statements that she witnessed defendant buy an over-the-counter drug commonly used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, to request a curative instruction, or to object to the questioning, he failed to argue in his brief that the outcome in the trial court would have changed had counsel acted differently; thus, he failed to establish prejudice.
   State v. Nikle, 2006 ND 25, 708 N.W.2d 867, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel was not ineffective in failing to object pursuant to N.D.R.Ev. 702 to a state expert witness who testified that in his opinion the victim’s body was dragged to the place where it was found and that the victim was killed at another location, as, had the objection been made, the court would have easily concluded the witness had the expertise and qualifications to testify by way of his experience and training and it was even likely the witness would have been qualified to testify through lay opinion, and that, in any event, under the circumstances and foundation established for the opinions rendered, trial counsel’s failure to object was not deficient and did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.
   Rummer v. State, 2006 ND 216, 722 N.W.2d 528, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel was not ineffective in failing to adequately investigate various scientific evidence because any failure to bring forward testimony of an independent forensic entomologist and follow-up alibi witnesses would not have avoided evidence that defendant admitted to killing or participating in the victim’s homicide with details accurately depicting the circumstances or corroborating events surrounding the murder.
   Rummer v. State, 2006 ND 216, 722 N.W.2d 528, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the prosecution’s use of gender-based peremptory challenges because counsel testified that he was going to make an objection based on the prosecution’s gender-based strikes, but he realized that he was not in a good position to do so because he had struck men from the jury. The district court decided that trial counsel’s decision about jury selection was a reasonable decision and did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.
   Flanagan v. State, 2006 ND 76, 712 N.W.2d 602, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a gross sexual imposition case, counsel was not ineffective for failing to interview and subpoena petitioner’s stepdaughter where, at the post-conviction hearing, the oldest stepdaughter did not testify, petitioner testified that he did not know how she would have testified, and there was other corroborating testimony from witnesses who saw the petitioner inappropriately touching the complainant; the credibility of those witnesses was not in dispute. Assuming counsel’s failure to interview and subpoena the stepdaughter, the petitioner did not satisfy his burden to establish a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s error, the result of the proceeding would have been different.
   Flanagan v. State, 2006 ND 76, 712 N.W.2d 602, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Without the benefit of a fully-developed record, defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed because (1) he could not show how his counsel’s performance was objectively deficient; and (2) there was no evidence on the record to determine whether defense counsel contacted an investigator; thus, defendant could not overcome the strong presumption of the objective reasonableness of his attorney’s performance. Even assuming he showed that his counsel’s performance was objectively deficient, he failed to show how his counsel’s performance prejudiced him or that the outcome would have been different but for the errors of counsel since he did not show that but for counsel’s failure to follow up with the investigator, he would not have pled guilty; although defendant’s claim was meritless, he could raise the issue in a post-conviction proceeding.
   State v. Bates, 2007 ND 15, 726 N.W.2d 595, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant could not satisfy the burden of proof for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the trial court did not err in denying his post-conviction application where the district court found defendant’s trial counsel was prepared for trial as evidenced by the numerous pretrial motions and hearings and also found that many of the alleged errors could be attributed to trial tactics. Moreover, defendant failed to establish that his trial counsel’s alleged deficient performance affected the outcome of the case.
   State v. Austin, 2007 ND 30, 727 N.W.2d 790, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction and sentence under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.19.html#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-23" target="_blank">19-03.1-23</a></cite>(1)(a) was reversed as the trial court should not have required his prior cocaine-related conviction to be admitted at trial because, under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.19.html#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-23" target="_blank">19-03.1-23</a></cite>(1)(a)(1), one prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver enhances a defendant’s sentence, but it does not enhance the offense from a class A felony to a more serious class and a prior conviction that enhances a sentence, but not the seriousness of the offense, is generally not regarded as an element of the offense; thus, Apprendi did not require the prior conviction be proved “beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury”. Furthermore, it was ineffective assistance for defense counsel to succumb to the trial court’s misunderstanding of Apprendi and to stipulate to sending the prior conviction to the jury; admission of that evidence constituted prejudicial and reversible error.
   State v. Tutt, 2007 ND 77, 732 N.W.2d 382, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Postconviction relief was denied in a case where defendant alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because the decisions were mostly based on a defense strategy, such as the failure to call a handwriting expert and the failure to request a mistrial. Moreover, a motion to change venue would have been futile, and testimony regarding intent would have been irrelevant since that was not an element of the crimes charged.
   Noorlun v. State, 2007 ND 118, 736 N.W.2d 477, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s second application for postconviction relief was denied because there was no claim for ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal since defendant represented himself; moreover, he failed to meet the requisite showing of ineffectiveness pertaining to his first application for postconviction relief. Defendant did not show that the alleged errors of counsel were prejudicial or that the outcome would have been different without those alleged errors.
   Steen v. State, 2007 ND 123, 736 N.W.2d 457, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite any delay leading up to the trial, defendant’s continued incarceration was due to defendant’s own actions, rather than the result of any alleged ineffective assistance of counsel; it appeared that defendant was actually arrested for another offense while out on bond, which resulted in defendant’s bond being revoked.
   State v. Schweitzer, 2007 ND 122, 735 N.W.2d 873, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to post-conviction relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims where defendant did not request an evidentiary hearing or present any evidence that his attorney’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness or that the deficient performance prejudiced him in any way, and defendant did not provide any evidence supporting his claim that his attorney failed to call witnesses, such that he did not establish that his attorney’s performance was deficient or prejudiced him.
   Everett v. State, 2008 ND 199, 757 N.W.2d 530, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 222</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s counsel was not ineffective where defendant failed to establish that his trial attorney’s trial preparation fell below the objective standard of reasonableness or that he was prejudiced by the alleged deficient performance and trial counsel’s cross-examination of a witness did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness; the trial attorney could not be faulted for making a strategic decision to keep an alleged weapon out of evidence and away from the jury’s focus and counsel could decide to forego an objection because any damaging effect from the testimony was minimal.
   Clark v. State, 2008 ND 234, 758 N.W.2d 900, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Post-conviction relief was properly denied in a case alleging ineffectiveness of counsel because appellant applicant did not present any affidavits or supporting materials after the State requested summary disposition; moreover, he did not inform the district court that he had witnesses to present. If the applicant thought that the district court denied him the opportunity to present testimony, an offer of proof should have been made under N.D.R.Ev. 103(a)(Ude v. State, 2009 ND 71, 764 N.W.2d 419, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the allegedly sleeping juror and, therefore, failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that but for his trial counsel’s failure to seek a remedy for the alleged juror misconduct, the result of his criminal trial would have been different; the evidence revealed defendant’s trial counsel’s decision not to offer the letter to impeach the victim’s testimony or to bolster defendant’s testimony was a matter of trial strategy and did not fall below the objective standard of reasonableness.
   State v. Myers, 2009 ND 141, 770 N.W.2d 713, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel was not ineffective for failing to present the testimony of petitioner’s alleged co-participant because, even if petitioner’s alleged co-participant testified in the manner suggested by an inmate’s statement, the jury would have likely still found petitioner guilty of murder because petitioner admitted to gagging the victim, leaving him bound in the hogtie position, and striking him in the head with the rock.
   Tweed v. State, 2010 ND 38, 779 N.W.2d 667, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even assuming arguendo that Padilla v. Kentucky applied, defendant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claims failed as: (1) defendant was not represented by an attorney when defendant accepted the plea agreement in his first criminal case and (2) defendant failed to prove he was prejudiced by his attorney’s alleged failure to advise him of the deportation consequences of a second conviction because the record unequivocally showed defendant knew about deportation considerations after his first criminal case.

       <p>
        In a post-conviction relief case, an appellate court was unable to review findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard in N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) because the trial court did not mention the State’s alleged failure to comply with the requirements of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.12.1.html#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-09" target="_blank">12.1-32-09</a></cite>, and it failed to address the effectiveness of counsel relating to such.

       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in denying petitioner’s motion for post-conviction relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel because although counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness when he inadequately advised petitioner of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea, petitioner failed to show that he would not have entered a guilty plea and would have insisted on going to trial if counsel had properly advised him as that course of action was not rational in light of his particular circumstances. Bahtiraj v. State, 2013 ND 240, 840 N.W.2d 605, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s trial counsel was not ineffective when he failed to file a motion to suppress any and all evidence from the search of petitioner’s home because counsel specifically testified he believed there was no basis for a motion to suppress, that the police reports indicated that petitioner’s wife gave consent to search, and that neither petitioner’s wife nor petitioner ever expressed the consent was involuntary, and even if a suppression motion had been filed, the detective was merely conveying the factual reality of the situation, that if the wife did not act in a way to protect her child, social services would be notified. Kinsella v. State, 2013 ND 238, 840 N.W.2d 625, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s generic claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to suppress any and all statements did not meet petitioner’s burden of showing that counsel made errors so serious that he was not functioning as the “counsel” guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, and further, petitioner was unable to demonstrate how the alleged deficient performance of his trial counsel, in failing to raise Miranda, prejudiced his defense as to deprive him of a fair trial. Kinsella v. State, 2013 ND 238, 840 N.W.2d 625, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s trial counsel was not ineffective by failing to enter an allegedly exculpatory lab report into evidence because petitioner was charged with knowingly having sexual contact with another person, and contact did not require the presence of semen in a vaginal swab, so the jury still could have convicted him of sexual assault even if no semen was present in the vaginal and rectal swabs of his stepdaughter, and petitioner’s other claims second guessed the trial strategy through the distorting light of hindsight. Kinsella v. State, 2013 ND 238, 840 N.W.2d 625, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s claim that the district court erred in holding a conference in his absence was barred because he failed to raise the issue on direct appeal, and the conference did not fall under one of the phases requiring him to be present; trial counsel’s performance concerning the hearing was not deficient given his testimony that there was inadequate time to contact petitioner and the fact that he communicated the facts to petitioner and was forced to act quickly because trial was scheduled for the next day. Kinsella v. State, 2013 ND 238, 840 N.W.2d 625, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s trial counsel was not ineffective when he failed to claim error for the trial court’s procedure in responding to two specific questions and/or failed to exercise petitioner’s statutory right to have the jury brought into the courtroom and have the information requested by the jury given to it because the jury did not request testimony or to be brought into court, the trial court’s communication with the jury was made in open court in the presence of petitioner and his counsel, and counsel testified that he found the trial court’s response acceptable to the defense. Kinsella v. State, 2013 ND 238, 840 N.W.2d 625, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to advise petitioner of his right to testify or not to testify because the decision to take the stand was part of the defense’s strategy.

       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to test bed sheets for the DNA of petitioner’s wife’s because counsel did elicit testimony from petitioner that his wife’s DNA could possibly be present on the bed sheets of his stepdaughter that he was accused of sexually assaulting, and regardless, it was at best speculative that the outcome of the trial would have been different if an independent DNA analysis was conducted. Kinsella v. State, 2013 ND 238, 840 N.W.2d 625, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly denied petitioner's application for postconviction relief because he failed to establish he was prejudiced by the allegedly deficient performance of his counsel; petitioner presented no evidence that would support a finding of prejudice on his claim that he was not properly advised on how the plea agreement could affect his desire to be sentenced to the Teen Challenge program because the court indicated he would not be sentenced to the program if sentenced after trial.

        District court properly denied petitioner's application for postconviction relief because he failed to establish he was prejudiced by the allegedly deficient performance of his counsel, and the district court applied the correct standard; petitioner offered nothing but subjective speculation and self-serving statements that he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial, and he voluntarily pleaded guilty. Booth v. State, 2017 ND 97, 893 N.W.2d 186, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        District court properly denied appellant's application for post-conviction relief on the basis of the first prong of the Strickland test. Because appellant failed to meet his burden of proving his counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, it was unnecessary to analyze the second prong of the Strickland test. Saari v. State, 2017 ND 94, 893 N.W.2d 764, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 2017).

       <p>
        Petitioner failed to show his trial counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and failed to meet his burden to show there was a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Although petitioner argued his counsel was ineffective as a matter of law because counsel failed to move for acquittal, petitioner failed to provide any evidence showing the State did not present a prima facie case.

       </p>
       <p>
        It was error to grant summary disposition dismissing defendant’s application for post-conviction relief because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendant received effective assistance of counsel when pleading guilty, as nothing in the record indicated defendant agreed with counsel to lifetime probation provided in defendant’s plea bargain.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant showed no ineffective assistance of counsel because (1) the record did not show one attorney told defendant to write and send a letter to the State, (2) another attorney discussed accomplice liability and Alford pleas with defendant before a change of plea hearing, met with defendant many times, and did not coerce defendant to accept a plea agreement, (3) the record showed counsel advised defendant of the 85 percent rule, and (4) defendant showed no greater probability that, but for counsel’s errors, defendant would not have pled guilty.

        The defendant in a criminal cause is ordinarily bound by any course of action that is followed with respect to his defense by counsel employed by him, but where, during the trial, his counsel is so incapacitated as not to comprehend what is taking place, the defendant’s rights are not safeguarded and he is entitled to a new trial.

        Absent a valid waiver of the right to counsel, a resulting conviction cannot, under this section, be used to enhance a term of imprisonment for a subsequent offense. State v. Orr, 375 N.W.2d 171, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 409</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        To allow an accused’s punishment to be enhanced to include imprisonment solely because of a prior uncounseled conviction violates the dictate of this section that one accused of a crime is entitled to counsel. State v. Orr, 375 N.W.2d 171, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 409</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        A prior uncounseled conviction, without waiver of counsel, is an impermissible factor which may not be substantially relied on by a trial judge in sentencing a defendant. State v. Cummings, 386 N.W.2d 468, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 311</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        District court properly considered defendant’s prior criminal convictions as part of her criminal history at sentencing because they were not relied upon to enhance her term of incarceration, defendant did not show that the prior convictions were, in fact, uncounseled or that the district court abused its discretion in applying the sentencing factors in an illegal manner, her sentence was below the statutory maximum and within statutory limits, and her prior convictions were properly considered by the district court as her criminal history and as one of many sentencing factors.

        Where the accused appears in the district court, states that he knows of his right to be represented by counsel, that he does not desire to be so represented, that he is ready to proceed and desires to plead guilty to the offense charged against him and judgment is passed thereon, he has not been denied due process of law. State ex rel. Johnson v. Broderick, 75 N.D. 340, 27 N.W.2d 849, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1947).

        A waiver of counsel by a defendant in a criminal case is not effective unless it is freely and understandingly made. State v. Magrum, 76 N.D. 527, 38 N.W.2d 358, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1949).

       <p>
        Where an accused personally enters a plea of guilty to a crime whereof he stands charged, and does so understandingly, freely and voluntarily, without asking the assistance of counsel, a waiver of the right to be represented by counsel may be fairly inferred.

        The defendant’s written request that the court either move his trial date forward to accommodate his attorney’s absence, appoint another attorney, or allow him to represent himself was not an unequivocal waiver of his right to counsel and the trial court did not commit error in denying his right to self-representation as any ambiguity had to be resolved against waiver.

        The defendant’s indication that “I will be representing myself” as part of a pro se discovery motion did not constitute waiver of his right to counsel; the statement was equivocal, and the defendant was represented by counsel when the motion was filed.

        Defendant’s constitutional right to represent himself was not violated because the trial court was not required to inquire into defendant’s wishes and did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant’s request to represent himself because defendant’s request was not unequivocal. Defendant disagreed with how his attorney was questioning certain witnesses and his attorney’s trial strategy; defendant’s request was an impulsive, emotional response to his frustration with his attorney rather than a clear and unequivocal invocation of the right to self-representation.

        District court properly determined that defendant was competent to stand trial and to conduct the trial himself, and defendant was not choosing between incompetent counsel and self-representation, such that his waiver of his right to counsel was voluntary; defendant waived his right to counsel knowingly and intelligently and he had no right to court-appointed standby counsel.

       <p>
        Record did not establish that defendant had knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel where nothing in the record suggested that the disagreements between defendant and his appointed attorney amounted to irreconcilable conflicts or conflicts of interest, there was no evidence that defendant's desire to hire private counsel was intended primarily to delay the trial, and the court had not informed him of the dangers and disadvantages of proceeding without the skill and experience of counsel before allowing his appointed to counsel to withdraw.

        The defendant had a constitutional right to be present in person during the proceedings involving a jury request for a legal definition and court response thereto, and that right was violated; however, this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, where the trial court, upon receiving the jurors’ request for information, immediately notified the prosecutor and the defendant’s counsel, the court discussed the request with counsel, and the defendant’s attorney approved the trial court’s response to the jury request.

        While a trial court committed plain error in responding to a jury’s request for a transcript of a witness’s testimony without calling the jury into open court, the error did not affect defendant’s substantial rights because defendant was not prejudiced by the error; the overwhelming evidence, including the audio recording of the controlled methamphetamine buy, the testimony of a confidential informant, and the testimony of the investigating officer, supported defendant’s conviction for delivery of methamphetamine.

        Prosecutor’s statement made during voir dire of the jury, when taken in the context in which it was made, that “someone will not get up and say I did it” did not constitute an improper comment on defendant’s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and did not force defendant to take the witness stand at trial.

        The prosecutor does not comment on the defendant’s failure to testify if the statement is made before the defendant has an opportunity to testify.

        Defendant was estopped from asserting that failure to advise him of his right to have an attorney appointed if he could not afford one violated his rights as set forth in Miranda where he interrupted the officer giving him his Miranda rights before he could be advised of his right to appointed counsel and said: “I know my rights.

        Although defendant was given the Miranda warnings prior to his confession, that fact alone did not make the confession voluntary; defendant’s confession to police officers was not voluntary, even though he had been given the Miranda warnings, and was therefore not admissible evidence, where at the time he gave the confession he was still scared and frightened as a result of an earlier confrontation with the victim and another person in which he was shouted at, chased, captured, and taken to the police station.

        Record supported the district court’s conclusion that defendant’s confession was voluntary; he was forty-two years old, a high school graduate, held a steady job, owned two homes, and was previously incarcerated for six months and therefore had experience with law enforcement. Although there was some evidence that defendant had a low intelligence level and could not read or write well, that alone was not enough to render his confession involuntary.

        A defendant in a criminal case who takes the witness stand in his own behalf is subject to the same rules of cross-examination as govern other witnesses, and he is required to answer any relevant and proper question on cross-examination that will tend to convict him of the crime for which he is being tried.

        Where an accused voluntarily takes the witness stand in his own behalf he waives his constitutional privilege of not answering questions that may tend to convict him of the crime for which he is on trial, and when he offers testimony upon any fact, the same constitutes a waiver as to all other relevant facts because of the necessary connection between them all.

Defendant’s statement that “I wanted to take the stand and he said that it was better that I wouldn’t” reflected that he knew he could have testified but chose not to, at least not until the jury had returned a guilty verdict; the record contained nothing about any discussion between defendant and his attorney regarding his right to testify, and did not reflect that the attorney misinformed him about the right to testify, improperly influenced his decision about testifying, or otherwise prevented him from testifying.

        DUI defendant’s challenge to sentence enhancement based on a prior uncounseled DUI guilty plea in which he alleged that the original sentencing court failed to advise him that the conviction could be used as enhancement in subsequent criminal proceedings was an improper collateral attack on the prior guilty plea; defendant stipulated he had signed the waiver of attorney form in the earlier proceeding and he failed to provide any reason why his waiver of his right to counsel was deficient.

        In order to survive a vagueness challenge, a statute must meet two requirements: (1) it must provide adequate warning as to the conduct proscribed, and (2) it must establish minimum guidelines to govern law enforcement.

        A criminal statute is not unconstitutionally vague merely because it does not specifically designate various different means by which a crime is committed. Shopkeepers can know, by reading statute, that they cannot sell a stove or a refrigerator or a television set or a lawnmower. Many sections of prohibited commodities list use terms that are understandable to judges, juries, shopkeepers, and police officers. It cannot be said, therefore, that statute is vague in all its applications. Best Prods. Co. v. Spaeth, 461 N.W.2d 91, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by denying a mother’s request to postpone a parental rights termination proceeding so that she could appear in person at the hearing.

        In a termination of parental rights case, the alleged due process violation - the application of the expedited appeal procedures under N.D.R.App.P. 2.2 - did not result in an unacceptable risk of an erroneous deprivation of the mother’s interests in her children because she did not cite any negative effect resulting in the application of Rule 2.2, she did not assert that her present appeal was deficient, and she did not show any risk of an erroneous deprivation of her interests through the procedures used.

        An evidentiary hearing before termination of workers’ compensation benefits would unduly burden the governmental interest because medical records will usually resolve whether the claimant can work.

       <p>
        The workers’ compensation bureau’s procedures denied the claimant due process, where the claimant was not given a pretermination notice that his disability benefits would be terminated, a summary of the medical evidence supporting termination, and an opportunity to respond. Beckler v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 418 N.W.2d 770, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The workers’ compensation bureau’s practice of securing medical opinion in the form of written responses to questions posed by the bureau did not deprive claimant of his right to due process since claimant was given an opportunity to be heard and to subpoena and cross-examine the responding doctor, albeit at the claimant’s own expense. Howes v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 429 N.W.2d 730, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1014, 109 S. Ct. 1126, 103 L.

        Although defendant argued the prosecutor used a peremptory challenge based on race to strike one of the few minority jurors on the panel, the prosecutor articulated clear and specific race-neutral reasons in this case for his use of the peremptory challenge, and there was no pattern of peremptory challenges against members of a constitutionally cognizable group. The district court was not clearly erroneous in finding no purposeful racial discrimination. State v. Garnder, 2016 ND 161, 883 N.W.2d 471, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        When the nature of the evidence in an action for damages, is such that no verdict for the plaintiff can be returned except one based upon mere conjecture, surmise, or speculation, it is proper for the trial court to direct a verdict for the defendant. Scherer v. Schlaberg, 18 N.D. 421, 122 N.W. 1000, 1909 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 49</cite> (N.D. 1909).

       <p>
        Once the defendant has made a prima facie showing of a violation of the fair cross-section requirement for the jury panel from which his jury has been selected, the burden shifts to the state to show a significant interest manifestly and primarily advanced by aspects of the jury selection process that have resulted in the disproportionate exclusion of a distinct group.

        Where a trial court clerk, in an attempt to fully seat a jury for defendant’s trial after voir dire was already in progress, telephoned only women who were on the jury wheel that she knew would be at home and not at work, defendant failed to show that the fair cross-section requirement for the jury panel was violated merely because four women were seated on the jury from those efforts.

        Because a prosecutor gave a clear and specific race-neutral explanation for exercising a peremptory challenge against the only African-American juror, that the juror peremptorily challenged had been a juror in an earlier negligent homicide case the prosecutor had prosecuted in which the jury had acquitted the defendant, the prosecutor noted the juror was reading a book when the judge was talking to the potential jurors, and the prosecutor had concerns about the juror’s answers to questions about the juror’s understanding of self defense, an issue which would be raised in the case; therefore, a district court did not err in rejecting two African-American defendants’
   Batson challenge.

        In a patient’s sexually dangerous person commitment proceeding, the patient was not denied the right to a trial by jury because the involuntary civil commitment provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 created a statutory proceeding that was unknown at the time that the North Dakota Constitution was adopted in 1889. Consequently, there was no right to a jury trial.

        In a gross sexual imposition case where the jury had to unanimously agree which sexual act or acts the defendant engaged in to find him guilty, a district court's failure to include information in the jury instructions identifying the underlying act for each count of the offense or to instruct the jury that it had to unanimously agree on the underlying act for each count constituted an obvious error; the complaint was not read to the jury and a copy of the complaint was not given to the jury with the jury instructions.

        Defendant was denied his right to a jury trial where he was tried by court and record did not reveal that defendant expressly and intelligently consented to waiver of his right to a trial by jury; when a written waiver is not submitted, a trial court could eliminate doubt and safeguard rights of a defendant by obtaining an express statement of defendant specifically indicating on record that a jury trial is or is not waived. State v. Kranz, 353 N.W.2d 748, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 334</cite> (N.D. 1984).

        The mere selection by defendant of a court trial over a jury trial provides no indication that defendant understood the implications of his decision. State v. Haugen, 384 N.W.2d 651, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 278</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a defendant indicates a desire to waive his or her right to a jury trial, it is the responsibility of the trial court to ascertain whether or not the defendant’s jury trial waiver is a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent decision done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences. State v. Haugen, 384 N.W.2d 651, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 278</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        Where the prosecutor performs the judicial function of advising an uncounseled defendant out of the presence of the judge, where that advice includes incorrect statements of law, and where a defendant is provided with a written statement of rights which contains waivers that are entirely inappropriate to the situation, the North Dakota supreme court cannot conclude that the waiver of defendant’s right to a jury trial was a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent decision. State v. Haugen, 384 N.W.2d 651, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 278</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        Although the trial judge informed the defendant of his right to a jury trial, and the state maintained that the defendant was given a document informing him of his right to a jury trial, through which he waived that right, but the document was not part of the record and could not be found, there was no waiver of the right to a trial by jury. State v. Bohn, 406 N.W.2d 677, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 320</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Silently proceeding with trial before a six-person jury is not an express and affirmative waiver of one’s constitutional right to a jury of twelve. State v. Hegg, 410 N.W.2d 152, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 371</cite> (N.D. 1987).

The fact that the demand for a jury trial was made within ten days of the trial court’s March 6, 1989 order that the trial would not be continued was irrelevant, as that order was not a pleading directed to the issues of the case. Greenwood, Greenwood &amp; Greenwood, P.C. v. Klem, 450 N.W.2d 745, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Requirement in Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act that individual petition in district of conviction rather than in district of confinement is a reasonable regulation and constitutionally permissible; it is not a restriction on the constitutional right to habeas corpus; provisions of act affecting venue of district courts are not unconstitutionally restrictive.

        The Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act was never intended to create a new remedy to wholly replace habeas corpus and the other common-law writs. Rather, the Uniform Act creates a procedure which implements the writ of habeas corpus and provides an opportunity for more extensive development of the issues and a more complete record for review. Jensen v. State, 373 N.W.2d 894, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 394</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        The appeal provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32 (now N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1) are a cumulative, and not a superseding, remedy, and the right of the people to invoke the original jurisdiction of the supreme court in habeas corpus is still viable. Thus, an unsuccessful applicant for post-conviction relief may seek appellate review pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32-09 (see now N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.29.html#t29c29-32.1s29-32.1-14" target="_blank">29-32.1-14</a></cite>) or may petition the supreme court for an original writ of habeas corpus.

        In an appeal from a judgment under the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act, the supreme court applies the “clearly erroneous” standard of N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) in reviewing fact questions. Rule 52(a) is inapplicable in original habeas corpus proceedings, and the supreme court reviews the record de novo. Thus, the court’s review of fact issues is more liberal under its original habeas corpus jurisdiction than it would be in an appeal under the Uniform Act. Jensen v. State, 373 N.W.2d 894, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 394</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        A husband who has been granted an absolute divorce for the fault of the wife and has agreed to the entering of an order directing him to pay her a certain sum per month, is not subject to imprisonment for contempt upon his failure to make such payments.

       Section 16. [Private property not taken without just compensation]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation having been first made to, or paid into court for the owner, unless the owner chooses to accept annual payments as may be provided for by law. No right of way shall be appropriated to the use of any corporation until full compensation therefor be first made in money or ascertained and paid into court for the owner, unless the owner chooses annual payments as may be provided by law, irrespective of any benefit from any improvement proposed by such corporation. Compensation shall be ascertained by a jury, unless a jury be waived. When the state or any of its departments, agencies or political subdivisions seeks to acquire right of way, it may take possession upon making an offer to purchase and by depositing the amount of such offer with the clerk of the district court of the county wherein the right of way is located. The clerk shall immediately notify the owner of such deposit. The owner may thereupon appeal to the court in the manner provided by law, and may have a jury trial, unless a jury be waived, to determine the damages, which damages the owner may choose to accept in annual payments as may be provided for by law. Annual payments shall not be subject to escalator clauses but may be supplemented by interest earned.
     </p>
     <p>
      For purposes of this section, a public use or a public purpose does not include public benefits of economic development, including an increase in tax base, tax revenues, employment, or general economic health. Private property shall not be taken for the use of, or ownership by, any private individual or entity, unless that property is necessary for conducting a common carrier or utility business.

        Bars did not suffer an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation when the city enacted ordinances that prohibited businesses that served alcohol from also offering adult entertainment, and allowed adult entertainment establishments to operate only in certain zoned areas, and therefore the city was properly granted summary judgment, because: (1) the ordinances advanced a legitimate government interest in reducing the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments; (2) any investment-backed expectations held by the bars were neither legitimate nor reasonable; (3) the economic impact on the bars was not appreciable in a constitutional sense; and (4) the bars could not claim that the ordinances deprived them of all economically viable use of their property, as they could continue to operate bars in their present location, relocate and offer adult entertainment without an alcoholic beverage license, or convert their businesses to unregulated enterprises.

        City’s denial of a building permit to property owner because a portion of his property was a drainage ditch constituted an inverse condemnation of the property where the denial of the building permit, together with the existing zoning regulations, limited the use of the property to a park or playground and had the effect of either converting or expanding the use of the property as a drainage ditch, which constituted a taking for public use. Kraft v. Malone, 313 N.W.2d 758, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 348</cite> (N.D. 1981), overruled, Shark v. Thompson, 373 N.W.2d 859, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Landowner was deprived of all reasonable use of his property and was entitled to just compensation for a taking by inverse condemnation where a city enacted a zoning ordinance which dedicated his property solely for governmental uses and specifically prohibited any residential, commercial and industrial uses of the property; if city rescinds the ordinance he is entitled to compensation only for a temporary taking measured by the time period between the date the ordinance took effect and the date it was rescinded, and if city retains the ordinance he would be entitled to compensation for a permanent taking of his property.

        Where dam in drain which was part of public diversion facility restricted drainage of surface waters from landowner’s farmland, thereby resulting in a permanent diminution in the value of the property, the ever-present obstacle to surface water drainage caused by the dam’s existence constituted a permanent taking of a flood easement on landowner’s property for which landowner was entitled to compensation.

        Property owner failed to establish a rezoning ordinance constituted a taking or damaging of his property without just compensation by means of inverse condemnation where he made no claim the ordinance forbade substantially all use of his property and he failed to establish substantial expenditure in reliance on the zoning ordinance in existence prior to the rezoning. Minch v. Fargo, 332 N.W.2d 71, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 279</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 829, 104 S. Ct. 105, 78 L. Ed. 2d 108, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 1226 (U.S. 1983).

        City’s refusal to annex property and zone it for apartment buildings did not deprive the owner of all or substantially all reasonable uses of the land; although its value for future residential development was hampered by its proximity to a railroad, that adverse consequence was present long before, and was not caused by, the city’s failure to annex the property.

        City’s 21-month moratorium on issuing building permits did not constitute a per se categorical taking of the developer’s property. The developer had difficulty selling any lots from the very beginning of its existence and sold more lots at higher prices after the moratorium was lifted.

        In an inverse condemnation action under
   N.D. Const. art. I, § 16, the State of North Dakota was not liable to 100 landowners who claimed that government drainage projects caused their properties to flood above the ordinary high watermark of an adjacent lake because an act of God, in the form of an unprecedented wet cycle, was the sole proximate cause of their damages.

        District court erred in ordering summary judgment for a city in the owners' action for inverse condemnation because, while there was no dispute over the need to construct earthen dikes to protect the city from flooding, a question of fact existed as to whether the imminent danger facing the city gave rise to an actual necessity to take the owners' property where the city had contracted with property owners for clay to be used in constructing the dikes prior to the flood, but did not contract, obtain permission, or pay compensation to the owners for removal of the clay from their property.

        District court properly affirmed an Industrial Commission order granting a lessee's application to terminate existing oil and gas well spacing units, to create new spacing units, and to modify well setback requirements for portions of two spacing units because one lease specifically authorized the lessee to seek reunitization, the proposed spacing units and well configurations would prevent waste and the drilling of unnecessary wells, the surface owner did not have a right to a guaranteed share of production, the estimated reduction did not establish that the owner's correlative rights were violated, and appeals from administrative agency decisions could not be turned into inverse condemnation actions.

        The following elements must be present for a public use to exist in the state where property sought to be condemned is located: (1) the public must have either a right to benefit guaranteed by regulatory control through a public service commission or an actual benefit; (2) although other states may also be benefited, the public in the state which authorizes the taking must derive a substantial and direct benefit greater than an indirect advantage; and (3) the public benefit, while not confined exclusively to the state authorizing the use, must be inextricably attached to its territorial limits because the state’s sovereignty is also so constrained.

   property without just compensation as the landowners had no legitimate or reasonable investment-backed expectations in essentially using their premises in a commercial rather than a residential manner; the zoning ordinance had been in effect several years before the landowners purchased their residential lot, the injunction did not affect the use of their residential property as a residence in any manner, and the property would not have had any substantial increased marketability or market value if the property was allowed to be used for commercial or industrial use, and the highest and best use of the property was that of a residential home and garage.

        A law is not necessarily invalid because it is retroactive, unless it is invalid because it violates the constitutional guaranties that no bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing the obligations of contract shall ever be passed.

       <p>
        The change, by statute, of the place of confinement, pending execution, from the county jail to the state penitentiary, can add no disgrace to a condemned murderer and does not render the act ex post facto as applied to him. State v. Rooney, 12 N.D. 144, 95 N.W. 513, 1903 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 1903), aff'd, 196 U.S. 319, 25 S. Ct. 264, 49 L. Ed. 494, 1905 U.S. LEXIS 903 (U.S. 1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        The passage after a conviction of murder of a statute substituting the penitentiary for the county jail as the place of confinement pending execution, and directing that executions thereafter take place within the penitentiary walls, did not increase the punishment of the one convicted of murder in the first degree with the death penalty affixed, and was not ex post facto. State v. Rooney, 12 N.D. 144, 95 N.W. 513, 1903 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 1903), aff'd, 196 U.S. 319, 25 S. Ct. 264, 49 L. Ed. 494, 1905 U.S. LEXIS 903 (U.S. 1905).

        The statutory classification which distinguishes between persons injured by improvements to real property within 10 years after substantial completion and persons injured more than 10 years after substantial completion corresponds closely with legislative goals and does not violate this section.

         Limitation of Powers Absolute.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the provisions of Article I of the state Constitution the legislature is forbidden to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts, and because of N.D. Const. art. I, §§ 20 and 24, this limitation of the powers of the legislature is absolute and remains outside of the general powers of the government so long as the constitutional provision remains.

        The marriage dissolution fee does not violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal Constitution or this section or Article I, § 22 of the state Constitution. Gange v. Clerk of Burleigh County Dist. Court, 429 N.W.2d 429, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A rational basis standard was applied to a constitutional challenge to the marriage dissolution fee because no inherently suspect classification was involved, nor, for all purposes, does the right to divorce constitute a fundamental right.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The right to recover for personal injuries is an important substantive right for which the appropriate standard to review limiting legislation is the intermediate standard or the close correspondence test. That intermediate standard of review requires a close correspondence between statutory classification and legislative goals. Because the statute of repose contained N.D.C.C §
   <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.28.html#t28c28-01s28-01-44" target="_blank">28-01-44</a></cite>, also affects the right to recover for personal injuries, the supreme court will apply the intermediate standard of review.

        Exemptions, in a statute imposing a fee for the use of highways, of retailers delivering only gas and gas products from the bulk station directly to the farmer, and of farmers hauling lignite coal, if done for other farmers in exchange for work and not for cash, is based on arbitrary and discriminatory classifications, and renders the act unconstitutional.

       <p>
        The right to recover for personal injuries is an important substantive right for which the appropriate standard to review limiting legislation is the intermediate standard or the close correspondence test. That intermediate standard of review requires a close correspondence between statutory classification and legislative goals. Because the statute of repose contained N.D.C.C § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.28.html#t28c28-01s28-01-44" target="_blank">28-01-44</a></cite>, also affects the right to recover for personal injuries, the supreme court will apply the intermediate standard of review.

Const. art.

        A statute making penalties and interest on taxes payable to political subdivisions to which the taxes were payable does not grant special privileges or immunities. Rosedale Sch. Dist. v. Towner County, 56 N.D. 41, 216 N.W. 212, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 1927).

        The retail sales tax law which imposes a tax of 2% on all gross receipts regardless of amount of tax collected does not contravene this section of the state Constitution. F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Gray, 77 N.D. 757, 46 N.W.2d 295, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1951).

        Tax imposed upon gross receipts of mutual or cooperative telephone company based upon number of telephone stations per mile of line with minimum tax of fifty cents per telephone station, which is in lieu of all real or personal property taxes levied by state or any of its political subdivisions, and distributed to individual counties on basis of number of telephones in each county did not contravene rule of equality as required by fourteenth amendment to United States Constitution or art. I, § 21 of state Constitution; classification of companies based on differences in density of each company’s operation and relationship to productivity and ability to pay graduated tax was reasonable, and fact that one company was only one to be taxed at maximum allowable rate did not invalidate classification where any expanding company becoming sufficiently dense in its operation would be taxed at same rate.

        Legislature could classify trade associations incorporated in North Dakota and having as their primary purpose the representation of wheat producers from other groups for purposes of contracting for activities related to domestic wheat policy issues, wheat production, promotion and sales; the legislature’s classification of trade associations bore a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest of promoting activities related to domestic wheat policy issues, wheat production, promotion and sales; therefore, the trade association clause, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.04.html#t04c4-28s4-28-07" target="_blank">4-28-07</a></cite>(4) satisfied the rational basis standard of scrutiny, and the clause did not violate N.D.

        The provision that a law of a general nature shall have uniform operation is satisfied if the benefits and burdens of such a law fall equally upon all members of the class or classes upon which it operates. Vermont Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Whithed, 2 N.D. 82, 49 N.W. 318, 1891 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 1891), limited, Folsom v. Kilbourne, 5 N.D. 402, 67 N.W. 291, 1896 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 41</cite> (N.D. 1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        An act relating to all the objects to which it should relate, except one, is as much special legislation as if it had embraced only the subject excluded. Edmonds v. Herbrandson, 2 N.D. 270, 50 N.W. 970, 1891 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1891); Angell v. Cass County, 11 N.D. 265, 91 N.W. 72, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 212</cite> (N.D. 1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary that a law operates upon all alike, but it must operate alike upon all who are in like situations. Beleal v. Northern Pac. Ry., 15 N.D. 318, 108 N.W. 33, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        The true test of unlawful statutory discrimination is whether all who are similarly situated are similarly treated, and whether those who are similarly situated are hindered or prevented in their competition with one another.
   Gunn v. Minneapolis S. P. &amp; S. S. M. Ry., 34 N.D. 418, 158 N.W. 1004, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 41</cite> (N.D. 1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        The limitation imposed by this section upon legislation is that any classification provided as the basis for distinctive or special operation of the law must be natural, not artificial. Figenskau v. McCoy, 66 N.D. 290, 265 N.W. 259, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the validity of legislative classification, judicial inquiry does not concern itself with the accuracy of the legislative finding, but only with the question whether it is so lacking in any reasonable basis as to be arbitrary. Asbury Hosp. v. Cass County, 72 N.D. 359, 7 N.W.2d 438, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1943); Asbury Hosp. v.

        North Dakota’s pre-1983 gross insurance premiums tax under former N.D.C.C. §
   26-01-11(1) bore no rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose and therefore violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        There are three separate standards of review for equal protection claims, and the standard used in a particular case depends upon the challenged statutory classification and the right allegedly infringed. If the case involves an inherently suspect classification or an infringement of a fundamental right, the statute is subject to strict judicial scrutiny and will be held invalid unless it is shown that the statute promotes a compelling governmental interest and that the distinctions drawn by the classification are necessary to further its purpose; where an important substantive right is involved, it is necessary to determine whether or not there is a close correspondence between the statutory classification and the legislative goals the statute was designed to achieve. In all other cases, a legislative classification will be sustained unless it is patently arbitrary and bears no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. The rational basis test is the traditional standard for scrutinizing legislation facing equal protection attack and is most often utilized in cases involving economic and social welfare legislation.

        The legislature can neither enlarge nor diminish the qualifications necessary to entitle one to vote at a constitutional election. Johnson v. Grand Forks County, 16 N.D. 363, 113 N.W. 1071, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1907).

        When the law directs something to be done in a given manner, or at a particular time or place, then there is an implied prohibition against any other mode or time or place for doing the act. State ex rel. Frich v. Stark County, 14 N.D. 368, 103 N.W. 913, 1905 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1905).

        Constitutional provisions always operate prospectively, and not retrospectively unless the words used or the objects to be accomplished clearly indicate that a retrospective operation was intended.

       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature is forbidden to enact any law depriving a person of his property without due process of law, and because of this section such prohibition exists so long as N.D. Const. art.

        District court did not have authority to order that defendant have no contact with two of his children until the children turned 18 years old as part of his sentence of life in prison because there was no request from the children, their representative, or the State for the no contact order; thus, the constitutional provisions for victims did not apply. State v. Wilder, 2018 ND 93, 909 N.W.2d 684, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        In a criminal mischief case in which defendant was ordered to pay restitution, the district court abused its discretion in ordering restitution in the amount of $3,790 for damage to a 10-year-old copy machine because a victim was entitled to be made whole through a reasonable restitution amount based on the entirety of the actual losses, but the district court did not consider defendant's evidence of possible lower replacement costs, and instead, the district court misinterpreted the constitutional provision in determining that the school district was entitled to the amount it had expended; and the district court misapplied the law in finding it could not determine whether its restitution award made the victim beyond whole. State v. Kostelecky, 2018 ND 12, 906 N.W.2d 77, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 2018); State v. Kostelecky, 2018 ND 12, 906 N.W.2d 77, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a negligent homicide case, the victim's father actually incurred expenses from driving to and from the court proceedings as a direct result of defendant's criminal actions. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion, under these circumstances, when ordering restitution for travel expenses. State v. Bruce, 2018 ND 45, 907 N.W.2d 773, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by imposing restitution for extradition costs in defendant’s gross sexual imposition case (GSI) because defendant pleaded guilty to both the GSI and the bail-jumping charges, he fled the country during and from the GSI prosecution, it was his act of fleeing that directly resulted in the bail-jumping charges and the cost to return him for trial, and the trial court’s jurisdiction over restitution in the bail-jumping case was continually held open. State v. Rogers, 2018 ND 244, 919 N.W.2d 193, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court concluded the district court did not abuse its discretion in fixing the amount of restitution without regard to defendant’s ability to pay. The Supreme Court resolved an irreconcilable conflict between N.D. Const. art. I, § 25(1)(n), and N.D.C.D. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.12.1.html#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-08" target="_blank">12.1-32-08</a></cite>(1) by interpreting the constitutional amendment as implicitly repealing the conflicting portion of the statute. State v. Strom, 2019 ND 9, 921 N.W.2d 660, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly required defendant to pay restitution to the victim’s insurer because the restitution statute and the state constitution could be harmonized where the Supreme Court of North Dakota had determined that insurance companies fell within the statutory definition of “other recipient,” and, even if it were to determine that the definition of “victim” contained the constitution was limited to individuals, that definition did not conflict with the legislature’s expansion of restitution to “other recipients.”State v. Hunt, 2019 ND 127, 927 N.W.2d 412, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to possession of a stolen motorcycle, and the motorcycle was returned physically damaged, the trial court did not err in ordering defendant to pay restitution because the damage to the motorcycle was directly related to the criminal offense, and it could reasonably be inferred that damage was caused during possession of the stolen property. State v. Walker, 2019 ND 292, 936 N.W.2d 45, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 297</cite> (N.D. 2019), limited, State v. Harstad, 2020 ND 151, 945 N.W.2d 265, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        District court did not err in awarding $2,314.35 in restitution be paid to the victim for the damages to her car and for the stolen property because the victim was damaged as a direct result of defendant’s conduct of breaking into the victim’s car, and damaging the radio, speedometer glass, and HVAC controls; and the fact that the victim did not incur any actual expenses as she chose not to repair the damages or could not afford to repair the damages was not dispositive of whether she sustained damages and was entitled to restitution. Further, the fact that the victim received an insurance payout had no bearing on the district court’s award of restitution. State v. Pagenkopf, 2020 ND 33, 939 N.W.2d 2, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>

        Defendant’s acquittal of aggravated assault did not bar restitution because (1) defendant was only acquitted of causing a victim’s unconsciousness, and (2) defendant assault conviction was sufficient to support a restitution award. State v. McAllister, 2020 ND 48, 939 N.W.2d 502, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant was convicted of possession of a stolen vehicle, but was not charged with the theft of the vehicle, the district court abused its discretion by ordering restitution for the unrecovered personal property that was in the vehicle at the time the vehicle was stolen, but was not in the vehicle seven days later when defendant was arrested for, and charged with, possession of the stolen vehicle, because there was no immediate and intimate causal connection between the criminal conduct and the loss of the personal property. State v. Harstad, 2020 ND 151, 945 N.W.2d 265, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        State had no statutory right to appeal a restitution order in a criminal case because, although an order for restitution affected with finality the State’s ability to obtain recompense for a crime victim, the victim could seek recovery of damages independent from any action by the State in a civil action to recover other or additional damages suffered as a result of the crime; and the right of restitution would not be undermined or lost without appellate review as the victim could maintain a civil action seeking recovery of damages. State v. Conry, 2020 ND 247, 951 N.W.2d 226, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 237</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       Chapter 271, S.L. 1935, amending previous laws dealing with income taxes and containing a declaration that it was an emergency measure, was in effect from its passage and approval until it was repealed by the people at a referendum election.

       The power to declare an act an emergency measure granted under the Constitution was not affected by provisions forbidding a law impairing the right of initiative and referendum. Cuthbert v. Smutz, 68 N.D. 575, 282 N.W. 494, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1938).

       When the people enacted initiated measures they performed legislative functions and the constitutionality of their acts was determined under the same general principles as applied to the acts of the legislative assembly. State ex rel. Eckroth v. Borge, 69 N.D. 1, 283 N.W. 521, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1939).

      <p>
       A special session of the legislative assembly was subject to the “legislative power” of the people reserved in the initiative and referendum. State ex rel. Langer v. Olson, 44 N.D. 614, 176 N.W. 528, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 99</cite> (N.D. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       The initiative and referendum provisions did not alter or affect the principle that the fundamental purpose of legislation was to make every statute, enacted by the legislature, speak the will of the legislative agents chosen by the people. Whether the legislature or the people, through the initiative, be the lawmakers, the rule was the same. Baird v. Burke County, 53 N.D. 140, 205 N.W. 17, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional provision relating to legislation by initiative and referendum was substantially complied with where the secretary of state and other officials followed the existing statutory law relating thereto.

        Enjoining of the Secretary of State of North Dakota from placing an initiated measure on a ballot was appropriate because the petition to initiate the measure did not comply with the constitutional requirement that it contain the full text of the measure as the petition incorporated a statute by reference. Haugen v. Jaeger, 2020 ND 177, 948 N.W.2d 1, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        The former requirement that an initiative petition contain the full text of the measure initiated was satisfied where the text incorporated in the initiative petition completely expressed the legislative purpose. Anderson v. Byrne, 62 N.D. 218, 242 N.W. 687, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 1932).

        Committee chairman’s request to direct the Secretary of State to place the initiated measure on the ballot for the November 2, 2010, general election was denied as the plain language of N.D. Const. art. III required the petitions to contain the sponsors’ names and addresses, which was consistent with the enabling legislation in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.16.1.html#t16.1c16.1-01s16.1-01-09" target="_blank">16.1-01-09</a></cite>(2); there was no compliance with the constitutional mandate that the petition, including every circulated petition, contain the sponsors’ names and addresses.

       <p>
        Supreme court set aside decision of the secretary of state approving form of petition for referral of senate bill where the petition, although otherwise proper in form, contained an extraneous impermissible statement of intent which was not required by the constitution or statutes. Haugland v. Meier, 335 N.W.2d 809, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 317</cite> (N.D. 1983); Lips v. Meier, 336 N.W.2d 346, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 327</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of countervailing circumstances producing a form of excusable neglect, including apparent good faith of the sponsors and the lack of time in which to make corrections or amendments, the supreme court did not reverse the secretary of state’s approval of a referral petition which, although not containing an impermissible extraneous statement of intent, contained statements that served no useful purpose and were inaccurate and misleading, particularly with reference to the election when the matter was to be placed on the ballot and the number of signatures purportedly contained in each petition; however, supreme court warned that repetition of similar errors in the future will not qualify as a form of excusable neglect and will be cause for disapproval. Haugland v. Meier, 339 N.W.2d 100, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 394</cite> (N.D. 1983).

       <p>
        The secretary’s constitutional responsibility under this section to approve the form of a petition, is limited to ascertaining whether the petition complies with the statutory requirements for form and whether the petition contains impermissible, extraneous statements. In reviewing a petition for form, the secretary must not be concerned with the merits of the petition or with the substance of its text. Municipal Servs. Corp. v. Kusler, 490 N.W.2d 700, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in N.D. Const. art. III, § 10 compels the North Dakota Secretary of State to approve a recall petition solely on the basis of its form when its purpose cannot be accomplished under North Dakota law; unlike
   N.D. Const. art. III, § 2,
   N.D. Const. art. III, § 10 does not restrict the North Dakota Secretary of State’s authority in reviewing a petition to its form. Therefore, a mandamus petition was properly denied because the North Dakota Secretary of State did not abuse any authority by denying a recall petition that was not constitutionally compliant.

       In passing upon sufficiency of referendum petition, there was a presumption that each signature thereon was the genuine signature of person whose name it purported to be, and if proceedings were brought against petition upon any ground, the burden of proving signatures insufficient was upon party attacking it.

       Section 2. [Senatorial districts — Apportionment]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly shall fix the number of senators and representatives and divide the state into as many senatorial districts of compact and contiguous territory as there are senators. The districts thus ascertained and determined after the 1990 federal decennial census shall continue until the adjournment of the first regular session after each federal decennial census, or until changed by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly shall guarantee, as nearly as is practicable, that every elector is equal to every other elector in the state in the power to cast ballots for legislative candidates. A senator and at least two representatives must be apportioned to each senatorial district and be elected at large or from subdistricts from those districts. The legislative assembly may combine two senatorial districts only when a single member senatorial district includes a federal facility or federal installation, containing over two-thirds of the population of a single member senatorial district, and may provide for the election of senators at large and representatives at large or from subdistricts from those districts.

        There is inherent in a constitutional direction to a legislature to apportion representatives among senatorial districts according to population a limited discretion to make an apportionment that will approach, as nearly as is reasonably possible, a mathematical equality.

        Under this section as amended, while the power of the group of officials designated to make an apportionment in event the legislature failed to act expires ninety days after the adjournment of the legislature, the duty of the legislature to apportion is mandatory and continues until it is performed.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Sparse population is not a legitimate reason to justify population variance between representative districts in a court-ordered reapportionment plan since, in a state with less population, each individual vote may be more important than in a highly populated state. Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 95 S. Ct. 751, 42 L. Ed. 2d 766, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 25 (U.S. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Population variance of twenty percent between representative districts in court-ordered reapportionment plan cannot be justified by reasoning that there is no racial group whose voting power is minimized, since all citizens in districts that are under-represented lose some of their political power. Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 95 S. Ct. 751, 42 L. Ed. 2d 766, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 25 (U.S. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        After reviewing the history of former section 5, the court stated: “We cannot say that the people of our State would have desired the retention of the single-senatorial-district provision of Section 29 [art. II, § 29] without the balance of that section, permanently establishing the boundaries of the district. Accordingly, because we believe the people of our State wanted the effect of the two provisions of Section 29 [art. II, § 29], rather than one provision without the other, we hold that the section as a unit must fall because it is in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States”. State ex rel. Stockman v. Anderson, 184 N.W.2d 53, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent some persuasive justification, multimember districts, established by federal court as an interim remedy only, should not be made part of a permanent, federally imposed, redistricting plan, especially when contradicted by established state policy.

        An order seeking to restrain the secretary of state of North Dakota from performing his mandatory election duties on the basis of the existing law governing apportionment — Chapter 7, Session Laws N.D. 1931 — a law which had not been challenged by plaintiffs in the courts, was denied by the federal district court. The only law which plaintiffs contended was unconstitutional was the proposed apportionment plan, which had been adjudicated unconstitutional and void, and there was nothing before the court to indicate that the secretary of state was about to take any action in accordance with that act of apportionment.

        The purchase of an automobile for the use of the governor in connection with the performance of his official duties in lieu of payment or reimbursement for the expense of travel merely changed the mode of transportation available to the governor and did not increase the emoluments of his office.

       This section is in harmony with interpretation that a Corrupt Practices Act violation (N.D.C.C. ch. 16.1-10) is not grounds for an election contest because this section contemplates a conviction of bribery, perjury or other infamous crime before a person is ineligible for the legislative assembly.

         Certificate of Election.

       </p>
       <p>
        The issuance by the secretary of state of a certificate of election following a recount did not usurp the legislature’s power under this section to determine its own membership; the issuance of such a certificate following a canvass of returns by the state board of canvassers is a purely ministerial act and does not preclude action by the legislature to determine which of contending candidates to seat.

       <p>
        A legislative enactment, expressing the legislative power of the assembly concerning the employees of each house and its expenses, is paramount to the independent action of each house, without the concurrence of the other. State ex rel. State ex rel. Wattam v. Poindexter, 48 N.D. 135, 183 N.W. 852, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 1921).

       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature may prescribe a method for the initiation of a contest of the right of one to sit in the house, but such method is not exclusive and such legislation does not bind either house. State ex rel. Schmeding v. District Court of Sixth Judicial Dist., 67 N.D. 196, 271 N.W. 137, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        This provision means that each house is the sole judge of election returns. Neither house, nor the two houses together, can abridge the power vested in each house separately to make a final decision as to the qualifications of one of its members. State ex rel. Schmeding v. District Court of Sixth Judicial Dist., 67 N.D. 196, 271 N.W. 137, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1937).

        The direction by a court having jurisdiction, that the county auditor put the names of candidates for senator on the primary election ballot was not an infringement of the right of the senate to judge the qualifications of its members. State ex rel. Williams v. Meyer, 20 N.D. 628, 127 N.W. 834, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1910).

       </p>
       <p>
        Candidate’s petition pursuant to this section to have himself seated in the state senate did not preclude jurisdiction of the supreme court to review a district court’s decision on the election recount where the petition was withdrawn before any final action thereon was taken by the state senate.

     <p>
      Each house shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and a recorded vote on any question shall be taken at the request of one-sixth of those members present. No bill may become law except by a recorded vote of a majority of the members elected to each house, and the lieutenant governor is considered a member-elect of the senate when the lieutenant governor votes.
     </p>
     <p>
      No law may be enacted except by a bill passed by both houses, and no bill may be amended on its passage through either house in a manner which changes its general subject matter. No bill may embrace more than one subject, which must be expressed in its title; but a law violating this provision is invalid only to the extent the subject is not so expressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every bill must be read on two separate natural days, and the readings may be by title only unless a reading at length is demanded by one-fifth of the members present.
     </p>
     <p>
      No bill may be amended, extended, or incorporated in any other bill by reference to its title only, except in the case of definitions and procedural provisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The presiding officer of each house shall sign all bills passed and resolutions adopted by the legislative assembly, and the fact of signing shall be entered at once in the journal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every law, except as otherwise provided in this section, enacted by the legislative assembly during its eighty natural meeting days takes effect on August first after its filing with the secretary of state, or if filed on or after August first and before January first of the following year ninety days after its filing, or on a subsequent date if specified in the law unless, by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house, the legislative assembly declares it an emergency measure and includes the declaration in the Act. Every appropriation measure for support and maintenance of state departments and institutions and every tax measure that changes tax rates enacted by the legislative assembly take effect on July first after its filing with the secretary of state or on a subsequent date if specified in the law unless, by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to each house, the legislative assembly declares it an emergency measure and includes the declaration in the Act. An emergency measure takes effect upon its filing with the secretary of state or on a date specified in the measure. Every law enacted by a special session of the legislative assembly takes effect on a date specified in the Act.

      The legislative assembly shall enact all laws necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this constitution. Except as otherwise provided in this constitution, no local or special laws may be enacted, nor may the legislative assembly indirectly enact special or local laws by the partial repeal of a general law but laws repealing local or special laws may be enacted.

        Because the office of lieutenant governor is basically dependent upon the office of governor for the determination of which duties the lieutenant governor is to perform, it was not improper for the legislature to appropriate funds to the governor’s office to compensate the lieutenant governor for additional duties assigned to him by the governor.

        North Dakota has a long history of special laws jurisprudence and the supreme court has not been presented with any case evaluating classifications of a purported special law using a three-tiered, traditional equal protection analysis. The court has employed intermediate scrutiny to judge the validity of statutory classifications in cases that involve different provisions of the constitution. Best Prods. Co. v.

       <p>
        In light of differences between companies providing local exchange service and intraLATA (Local Access and Transport Area) long distance toll service and companies providing only long distance toll service, both intraLATA and interLATA, it was reasonable to classify them differently and to allow the companies providing local exchange service to maintain a slightly more convenient dialing disparity requiring customers desiring to use an interexchange carrier to dial an extra four-digit access code; the classification was a natural one, standing on reasons related to the character of the legislation challenged. Session Laws 1993, ch. 470 did not violate the special laws provision [see Note following N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.49.html#t49c49-21s49-21-08" target="_blank">49-21-08</a></cite> for text of S.L. 1993, ch. 470, § 1].

        The title of chapter 158, S.L. 1899, was “An act relating to titles to real property”. The title was faulty, because too general, but the subject of the act was expressed in the title and the law was not unconstitutional. Power v.

        In chapter 126, S.L. 1897, the subject of the act as stated in the title was that of taxation for the public revenues and the words “and for all other purposes relative thereto”, did not enlarge the subject. A section authorizing the recovery of taxes paid into the county treasury prior to the passage of the act, upon land exempt from taxation, was unconstitutional as relating to a matter foreign to the subject and purposes of the act as set out in the title. Divet v. Richland County, 8 N.D. 65, 76 N.W. 993 (1898), distinguished, Paine v. Dickey County, 8 N.D. 581, 80 N.W. 770 (1899) and Sherwood v.

       <p>
        Chapter 25, S.L. 1895, “to increase the revenues of the state by changing and increasing the boundaries of ” three counties, in the body of the act, simply increased the boundaries and, therefore, the act was unconstitutional because the subject was not expressed in the title.

        This section is intended to prevent the assemblage of incongruous and unconnected legislation. State v. Colohan, 69 N.D. 316, 286 N.W. 888, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of a constitutional provision requiring that no bill shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title, is that the title of the act may limit and confine the contents of the act itself, but the terms of the act cannot amplify and broaden the title. Dornacker v. Strutz, 71 N.D. 449, 1 N.W.2d 614, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the constitutional provision requiring that only one subject be embraced in a bill is to apprise the public, as well as the members of the assembly, of the purpose and object of legislation thus entitled, and if the title fails in that respect, the act is void. Dornacker v. Strutz, 71 N.D. 449, 1 N.W.2d 614, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1941).

         —Title of Act.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If an act embraces only a single subject in its body, it is not made invalid by the fact that the title expresses a plurality of subjects. Eaton v. Guarantee Co., 11 N.D. 79, 88 N.W. 1029, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1902); State ex rel. Gaulke v. Turner, 37 N.D. 635, 164 N.W. 924, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

Olson, 286 N.W.2d 262, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 319</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The title of a bill designed to accomplish one general object is not multifarious if it indicates that several subjects relating to that object are embodied in the bill. Great N. Ry. v. Duncan, 42 N.D. 346, 176 N.W. 992, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the title of an act fairly indicates the general scope of a bill designed to accomplish a single object, it is valid. Great N. Ry. v. Duncan, 42 N.D. 346, 176 N.W. 992, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        The subject matter of an act is to be interpreted in the light of its title, and where an act is subject to two interpretations, one of which would extend its provisions beyond the range of the title, the interpretation will be adopted which is in harmony with the act. Olson v. Erickson, 56 N.D. 468, 217 N.W. 841, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the provisions of an act are in furtherance of a general purpose expressed in the title, the title sufficiently expresses the subject matter. State ex rel. Gammons v. Shafer, 63 N.D. 128, 246 N.W. 874, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any matter may be included in an act which relates exclusively to, or is germane or auxiliary to, the subject expressed in the title. State v. McEnroe, 68 N.D. 615, 283 N.W. 57, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule deducible from the decisions is that if all the provisions of an act are germane to the subject expressed in the title then the act is valid as against any claim of violation of this section. Kessler v. Board of Educ., 87 N.W.2d 743 (N.D. 1958), decided prior to the 1961 repeal and reenactment of <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.15.html#t15c15-29" target="_blank">Chapter 15-29</a></cite> of the N.D.C.C.

       <p>
        The power of the lieutenant governor under former section 77 of the Constitution to cast tie-breaking votes in the senate did not apply to votes on final consideration of a bill, because the lieutenant governor was not a “member” of the senate and his vote was, therefore, ineffective to meet the requirement of this section that a bill be passed by a majority of the members of each house. (Decided prior to the 1978 amendment of former sections 65 and 77 of the Constitution.) State ex rel. Sanstead v. Freed, 251 N.W.2d 898 (N.D. 1977), decided prior to the 1978 amendment to former sections 65 and 77 of the N.D. Const. (now see art. 5, § 7).

        Though the journal entries relating to the history of a bill may be considered and are controlling over the enrolled bill as authenticated by the president of the senate and the speaker of the house, and approved by the governor, they are entitled to no probative weight, and the enrolled bill alone will be controlling where such journal entries are conflicting so that it is impossible to ascertain with certainty that the constitutional requirements were not complied with in the passage of such bill.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The provision of this section for initiative amendments was not self-executing, but was a mandate to succeeding assemblies to provide laws whereunder the constitution may be amended by an initiative petition. State ex rel. Linde v. Hall, 35 N.D. 34, 159 N.W. 281, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 142</cite> (N.D. 1916).

         Lieutenant Governor’s Vote.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The power of the lieutenant governor under former section 77 of the constitution to cast tie-breaking votes in the senate did not apply to votes on final consideration of resolutions proposing constitutional amendments, because the lieutenant governor was not a “member” of the senate and his vote was, therefore, ineffective to meet the requirement of this section that such a resolution be agreed to by a majority of the members of each house. (Decided prior to the 1978 amendment of former section 77 of the constitution.) State ex rel. Sanstead v. Freed, 251 N.W.2d 898 (N.D. 1977), decided prior to the 1978 amendment to former sections 65 and 77 of the N.D. Const. (now see N.D. Const. art. 5, § 7).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding the provisions of this section relating to constitutional amendment, the legislature apparently has the inherent power to call a constitutional convention. State ex rel. Wineman v. Dahl, 6 N.D. 81, 68 N.W. 418, 1896 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1896).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Repeals by implication are not favored but constitutional provisions may be impliedly repealed or abrogated by the adoption of changes in other portions which render such provisions obnoxious or ineffective. Egbert v. Dunseith, 74 N.D. 1, 24 N.W.2d 907, 1946 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1946).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The provision of this section that two or more amendments should be submitted for a separate vote by the electors was not violated by submitting as one amendment a proposed change which was expressed in two sections, where both related to one general subject and were designed to accomplish one main purpose.

        Former section 1 as amended by art. amd. 80, I.M. approved June 30, 1964 (S.L. 1965, ch. 475) read:
       </p>
       <p>
        “The executive power shall be vested in a governor, who shall reside at the seat of government and shall hold his office for the term of four years beginning in the year 1965, and until his successor is elected and duly qualified”.

        The second paragraph of art. amd. 80 read:

        “This amendment shall be self-executing, but legislation may be enacted to facilitate its operation”.

        Both this section and section 7 of this article imply that the legislature is not authorized to assign duties to the lieutenant governor; portion of statute was unconstitutional which assigned duties to lieutenant governor such that nature of office was changed from part-time office with legislative duties to full-time office with executive duties. State ex rel. Link v. Olson, 286 N.W.2d 262, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 319</cite> (N.D. 1979).

        The governor is justified in holding office until a properly qualified individual is elected. State ex rel. Olson v. Langer, 65 N.D. 68, 256 N.W. 377, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 178</cite> (N.D. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word successor, as used in this section, means someone who is entrusted with the powers and is obligated to perform the duties of his predecessor, and in the event of disqualification of the governor-elect, it includes the lieutenant governor-elect. State ex rel. Sathre v. Moodie, 65 N.D. 340, 258 N.W. 558, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1935).

        The fact that this section gives the governor the executive power does not give him the uncontrolled power to fill vacancies, but only where neither the constitution nor a statute has made provision therefor may he so act under the executive power. State ex rel. Standish v. Boucher, 3 N.D. 389, 56 N.W. 142, 1893 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 1893).

       <p>
        Although Constitution does not contain a general distributing clause expressly providing for division of governmental powers among the legislative, executive and judicial branches, creation of those branches operates as an apportionment of the different classes of power; as all branches derive their authority from same Constitution, there is an implied exclusion of each branch from the exercise of the functions of the others.

       <p>
        Term of governor began on January 1 and terminated on December 31 in fourth year thereafter, and governor-elect could assume duties of office as of January 1 next succeeding his election without affecting term of office; however, a governor could serve less than four years if, upon his own choosing, he did not take office until subsequent to January 1 next succeeding his election. Therefore, when incumbent governor was elected in 1980 and chose not to assume duties of his office until January 6, 1981, his term of office was from January 1, 1981 to December 31, 1984, and governor-elect in 1984 was entitled to hold office of governor from first moment of January 1, 1985 where he filed his oath of office on December 31, 1984 and chose to assume office on January 1, 1985.

      The qualified electors of the state at the times and places of choosing members of the legislative assembly shall choose a governor, lieutenant governor, agriculture commissioner, attorney general, auditor, insurance commissioner, three public service commissioners, secretary of state, superintendent of public instruction, tax commissioner, and treasurer. The legislative assembly may by law provide for a department of labor to be administered by a public official who may be either elected or appointed.

      The powers and duties of the agriculture commissioner, attorney general, auditor, insurance commissioner, public service commissioners, secretary of state, superintendent of public instruction, tax commissioner, and treasurer must be prescribed by law. If the legislative assembly establishes a labor department, the powers and duties of the officer administering that department must be prescribed by law.

        Five-year residency requirement of N.D. Const. art.

       The lieutenant governor had, by virtue of this section, “no vote unless [the senate] be equally divided except on such matters in which the Constitution provides otherwise”; however, former sections 65 and 202, requiring the passage of laws and resolutions for constitutional amendments by a majority of the members of each house did “provide otherwise” because the lieutenant governor was not a “member” of the senate, and so his tie-breaking vote would be ineffective to carry the measure; therefore, senate rule prohibiting the lieutenant governor from casting a tie-breaking vote on any but procedural questions was constitutional insofar as it forbade votes on bills for acts or on constitutional amendment resolutions, but unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited votes on other measures not carrying the force of law. State ex rel. Sanstead v. Freed, 251 N.W.2d 898 (N.D. 1977), decided prior to the 1978 amendment of former sections 65 and 77 of the Constitution.

       Section 9. [When bill becomes law — Veto power — Line-item veto]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every bill passed by the legislative assembly must be presented to the governor for the governor’s signature. If the governor signs the bill, it becomes law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governor may veto a bill passed by the legislative assembly. The governor may veto items in an appropriation bill. Portions of the bill not vetoed become law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The governor shall return for reconsideration any vetoed item or bill, with a written statement of the governor’s objections, to the house in which it originated. That house shall immediately enter the governor’s objections upon its journal. If, by a recorded vote, two-thirds of the members elected to that house pass a vetoed item or bill, it, along with the statement of the governor’s objections, must immediately be delivered to the other house. If, by a recorded vote, two-thirds of the members elected to the other house also pass it, the vetoed item or bill becomes law.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the legislative assembly is in session, a bill becomes law if the governor neither signs nor vetoes it within three legislative days after its delivery to the governor. If the legislative assembly is not in session, a bill becomes law if the governor neither signs nor vetoes it within fifteen days, Saturdays and Sundays excepted, after its delivery to the governor.

        Chapter 141, S.L. 1939, which declared that a candidate defeated for an office at a primary election should not be eligible as a candidate for the same office at the ensuing general election, was unconstitutional in that it added a qualification to those prescribed by this section and art.

       <p>
        The principle of separation of powers requires that statutes authorizing judicial review of administrative determinations be so construed that the judiciary’s role will be limited always to a review, judicial in scope, as defined by statute and case law, which avoids a substitution of the judgment of the judge for that of the administrator.

        Although Constitution does not contain a general distributing clause expressly providing for division of governmental powers among the legislative, executive and judicial branches, creation of those branches operates as an apportionment of the different classes of power; as all branches derive their authority from same Constitution, there is an implied exclusion of each branch from the exercise of the functions of the others.

       <p>
        This was an appropriate case to exercise the court's supervisory jurisdiction, because the trial court's order compelling disclosure of the claimed privileged or protected information could not be “unmade” and the company's remedy by later appeal from a judgment was not adequate. W. Horizons Living Ctrs. v. Feland, 2014 ND 175, 853 N.W.2d 36, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 2014).

       <p>
        Trial court's decision compelling the company to comply with discovery provided a blanket authorization for disclosure of the insurer's entire claims file and communications during settlement negotiations in a resident's prior lawsuit against the company, but the trial court did not assess the possible impact of the lawyer-client privilege or the effect of communications during compromise negotiations; the trial court had not conducted a private review of the documents, and the record was inadequate to permit review of the order, and a supervisory writ was issued vacating the order compelling discovery, with directions. W. Horizons Living Ctrs. v. Feland, 2014 ND 175, 853 N.W.2d 36, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        Application for supervisory writ would be denied unless action of trial court which supreme court was asked to supervise would result in grave or serious prejudice for which applicant had no adequate remedy; appeal was an adequate remedy.

       <p>
        Application for a supervisory writ under the court’s general power of superintendence must be made in an original proceeding to which the judge of the lower court is a party, and cannot be made during the course of an appeal. Schaff v. Kennelly, 69 N.W.2d 777, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1955).

        Where any harm to defendant that might flow from Insurer’s intervention in the medical malpractice suit was capable of being remedied in an appeal from an adverse judgment, case was not one in which there was no adequate alternative remedy, requiring court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction and issue a supervisory writ to prevent injustice. Roe v. Rothe-Seeger, 2000 ND 63, 608 N.W.2d 289, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 2000).

       <p>
        Where the trial court erred in determining that willfulness was the culpability required for the violation of a domestic violence protection order, and the state had no adequate alternative remedy but to seek a supervisory writ, the Supreme Court concluded that this was an appropriate case to exercise supervisory jurisdiction. State v. Holte, 2001 ND 133, 631 N.W.2d 595, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father was not entitled to a supervisory writ because nothing in the record suggested that the trial judge was biased or prejudiced, or that the case was an extraordinary case requiring the Supreme Court to exercise its discretion to prevent injustice. Rath v. Rath, 2018 ND 98, 909 N.W.2d 666, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the State of North Dakota lacked the ability to realistically appeal the district court’s orders denying a motion to amend the charge against defendant or the order denying a plea agreement, the Supreme Court of North Dakota concluded that the matter was an appropriate circumstance to consider exercising the court’s supervisory jurisdiction and considered the issues raised by the State on the merits. State v. Louser, 2021 ND 89, 959 N.W.2d 883, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 92</cite> (N.D. 2021).

State v. Nelson County, 1 N.D. 88, 45 N.W. 33, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 1890).

        A statute providing for certification of the evidence to the supreme court and that the supreme court “try the cause anew” had the effect of authorizing the court to review the evidence to determine whether the findings of fact were supported by the preponderance of the evidence, and this was within the court’s constitutional powers as a part of its appellate jurisdiction.

        The Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act (N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1) was never intended to create a new remedy to wholly replace habeas corpus and the other common-law writs. Rather, the Uniform Act creates a procedure which implements the writ of habeas corpus and provides an opportunity for more extensive development of the issues and a more complete record for review. Jensen v. State, 373 N.W.2d 894, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 394</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        The appeal provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32 (now N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1) are a cumulative, and not a superseding, remedy, and the right of the people to invoke the original jurisdiction of the supreme court in habeas corpus is still viable.

Const. art. VI, § 2 as well as the authority to issue a writ of prohibition. However, the state supreme court declined to decide the constitutional issue presented in the case–the state board of higher education’s authority over the state university–because the four state supreme court members required under N.D. Const. art. VI, § 4 did not agree to hear the issue and a writ of prohibition would not be issued to enjoin the Secretary of State from placing the referendum petition on the upcoming primary ballot because the Secretary of State had not been alleged to have been acting beyond that office’s powers.

The exercise of the supreme court’s supervisory jurisdiction is discretionary, rare and done only to rectify errors or prevent injustice when no adequate alternative remedies exist. City of Fargo v. Dawson, 466 N.W.2d 584, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 17</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parties moved the district court to certify its orders for appeal and it denied their motion, under normal circumstances the appeal should have been dismissed; however, where the facts presented were extraordinary, the supreme court could exercise jurisdiction, because it has authority to exercise its original jurisdiction by issuing a supervisory writ even though no application for a supervisory writ has been made. Where the orders affected the merits of the case, the appeal was considered a request to exercise supervisory jurisdiction. B.H. v. K.D., 506 N.W.2d 368, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exercise of the supreme court’s supervisory jurisdiction is discretionary, rare and done only to prevent injustices in extraordinary circumstances where no other remedy is adequate or allowed. Fibelstad v. Glaser, 497 N.W.2d 425, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a district court order compelling disclosure of documents in a private investigator’s file is not appealable, and the petitioners had no recourse but to produce the documents or be held in contempt, under these circumstances, petitioners had no viable alternative remedy to a supervisory writ; therefore, the case was appropriate for exercise of the court’s supervisory jurisdiction. Reems ex rel. Reems v. Hunke, 509 N.W.2d 45, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was appropriate for supreme court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction over cases in which judge denied orders for change of judge. Traynor v. Leclerc, 1997 ND 47, 561 N.W.2d 644, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Case presented was appropriate for Supreme Court’s exercise of supervisory jurisdiction; where it was extraordinary, significant injustice would result if trial court erred and party seeking to invoke Supreme Court’s power had no adequate remedy at law. State v. Hagerty, 1998 ND 122, 580 N.W.2d 139, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court issued a supervisory writ where trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction but refused to grant State’s motion to dismiss plaintiff’s claim under the North Dakota Human Rights Act though plaintiff failed to present a claim in compliance with N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.32.html#t32c32-12.2s32-12.2-04" target="_blank">32-12.2-04</a></cite>; the State had no other adequate remedy because the denial of a motion to dismiss is not appealable. State v. Haskell, 2001 ND 14, 621 N.W.2d 358, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court’s power to issue a supervisory writ, derived from this section, is discretionary and used only to rectify errors and prevent injustice in extraordinary cases for which there is no adequate alternative remedy, such as an action involving a motion to disqualify counsel; the order denying the motion is not immediately appealable, and proceeding to judgment would necessitate disclosure of confidential information. Cont'l Res., Inc. v. Schmalenberger, 2003 ND 26, 656 N.W.2d 730, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court declined to reverse an attempted murder conviction under its supervisory powers because an inmate failed to show improper governmental conduct or prejudice when statements relating to the case were taken from a private investigator’s office during a valid search. Ellis v. State, 2003 ND 72, 660 N.W.2d 603, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court exercised its discretionary, supervisory power to accept jurisdiction by supervisory writ under N.D. Const. Art. VI, § 2 because an important public interest in the workers’
   compensation immunity provisions of N.D.C.C. tit. 65 was present and the employer’s related company had no adequate alternative remedy in that the company could not appeal the denial of its summary judgment motion.
   Trinity Hosps. v. Mattson, 2006 ND 231, 723 N.W.2d 684, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 237</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>
        Under N.D. Const. art. VI, § 2 and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.27.html#t27c27-02s27-02-04" target="_blank">27-02-04</a></cite>, the Supreme Court of North Dakota had the authority to issue a supervisory writ reversing the district court’s order sealing the names of the jurors who sat on a highly publicized murder trial and the district court’s blanket closure of the trial jurors’ questionnaires because the case involved issues of vital concern about the interrelationship of guidelines for public and media access to court records, for juror privacy, and for a criminal defendant’s right to a fair trial, and because there was no adequate remedy by appeal to resolve those issues.
   Forum Communs. Co. v. Paulson, 2008 ND 140, 752 N.W.2d 177, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 2008).

        Harmless conversation on an unrelated topic between bailiff, petitioner, and jurors during a recess at petitioner’s trial for driving under the influence did not warrant the mistrial that the trial court granted in the State’s favor and, thus, the state supreme court under its authority to grant supervisory writs, N.D. Const. art. VI, § 2 and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.27.html#t27c27-02s27-02-04" target="_blank">27-02-04</a></cite>, could order the trial court to grant the motion to dismiss petitioner filed seeking dismissal of the relevant complaint in order to keep the State from retrying petitioner on that charge. Dismissal of the complaint was necessary to avoid trying petitioner in violation of petitioner’s right to be free from double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. V, which was made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV.
   Day v. Haskell, 2011 ND 125, 799 N.W.2d 355, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 2011).

       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Dakota lacked jurisdiction over a municipal court judgment denying petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief, because the appeal was not authorized by statute. The Supreme Court of North Dakota exercised its supervisory authority under N.D. Const. art. VI, § 2, because the case presented an important matter of public interest involving the jurisdiction of municipal courts over applications for post-conviction relief.

        Supervisory writ was denied where the owner had failed to exercise his right to remove the action from small claims court, and nothing suggested that this was an extraordinary case warranting supervisory jurisdiction to prevent injustice. Winter v. Solheim, 2015 ND 210, 868 N.W.2d 842, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court exercised its supervisory jurisdiction to review a district court's decision in a criminal case to exclude a special agent's testimony as expert testimony not properly disclosed because the jury was impaneled pending a stay of the proceedings and the State of North Dakota lacked another adequate remedy as the State's ability to appeal was limited. If defendant were acquitted by the jury, the State could not appeal. State v. Louser, 2017 ND 10, 890 N.W.2d 1, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 2017).

State v. Rath, 2017 ND 213, 901 N.W.2d 51, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        Supreme court exercised its discretion to review an issue raised in a mother's case because the mother had been incarcerated solely for contempt for well over 400 straight days, and the issue raised in the case was a question of first impression and involved a district court's authority to incarcerate persons found to be in contempt of court indefinitely; the issue was one of vital concern regarding matters of important public interest. Nygaard v. Taylor, 2017 ND 206, 900 N.W.2d 833, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred as a matter of law in denying the State's motion to dismiss respondent's negligence claim, where respondent failed to allege and support at least an intentional act done with the conscious purpose of inflicting the injury to overcome the State's immunity. Because the State had no adequate remedy to avoid defending a suit from which it had immunity, the Supreme Court granted the State's petition for a supervisory writ. State v. Haskell, 2017 ND 252, 902 N.W.2d 772, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the matter was resolved by pretrial diversion, there was no trial, verdict, or final judgment, the order approving pretrial diversion and the order to pay restitution were not appealable orders; however, although defendant’s appeal was not authorized by statute, the supreme court could and did exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to review the orders. State v. Jorgenson, 2018 ND 169, 914 N.W.2d 485, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court dismissed defendant’s appeal on counts 1, 2, and 5, referenced in the order approving pretrial diversion, for lack of jurisdiction because the order was not appealable under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.29.html#t29c29-28s29-28-06" target="_blank">29-28-06</a></cite> and the Supreme Court declined to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction under N.D.

        Employer was entitled to supervisory writs directing a district court to grant the employer summary judgment barring civil liability for deceased and injured workers’ injuries because Workforce and Safety Insurance’s unappealed decision that the workers were employees was res judicata.

       </p>
       <p>
        It was appropriate to exercise supervisory jurisdiction to determine whether a married person under 18 were a “child” under the Juvenile Court Act because time was of the essence, as (1) the person was 18, and (2) if the person were convicted in a district court found to lack jurisdiction, the case would have to begin anew in a juvenile court, which only had jurisdiction until the person was 20. State v. G.C.H, 2019 ND 256, 934 N.W.2d 857, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although an appeal was not authorized because all of the claims involved were not decided and none of the parties requested certification, the Supreme Court of North Dakota exercised its supervisory jurisdiction to review the judgment because the case presented a significant issue regarding the interpretation and application of a statute, which was an issue of vital concern regarding matters of important public interest and of which there was little guidance in the case law. Wilkinson v. Bd. of Univ. &amp; Sch. Lands of N.D., 2020 ND 179, 947 N.W.2d 910, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        State’s appeal was timely under N.D.R.App.P. 4(b); although the prosecutor’s statement accompanying the notice of appeal merely parroted the language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.29.html#t29c29-28s29-28-07" target="_blank">29-28-07</a></cite>(5), the appeal was properly before the court because a review of the facts clearly demonstrated the relevance of the evidence suppressed and the court had jurisdiction under N.D.

        A court has no power to declare a statute invalid on ground of unjust and oppressive provisions, unless such provisions contravene the state or federal constitution. The courts are not guardians of rights of people of the state, except as those rights are secured by some constitutional provision which comes within judicial cognizance. The protection against, and remedy for, unwise or oppressive legislation, within constitutional bounds, is by appeal to justice and patriotism of people themselves, or their legislative representatives. The judiciary can only arrest execution of a statute when it conflicts with the constitution. Best Prods. Co. v. Spaeth, 461 N.W.2d 91, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>
        North Dakota Constitution in N.D. Const. art. VI, § 3 gave the state supreme court the ultimate authority to promulgate rules and, thus, those rules took precedence over the legislature’s statutes in matters of procedure, as recognized by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.27.html#t27c27-02s27-02-09" target="_blank">27-02-09</a></cite>.

        Referendum petition suspending a senate bill that had reinstated a state statute requiring the state university to use the “Fighting Sioux” nickname and logo presented a justiciable issue that gave the state supreme court discretionary original jurisdiction under N.D. Const. art. VI, § 2 as well as the authority to issue a writ of prohibition. However, the state supreme court declined to decide the constitutional issue presented in the case–the state board of higher education’s authority over the state university- –because the four state supreme court members required under N.D. Const. art. VI, § 4 did not agree to hear the issue and a writ of prohibition would not be issued to enjoin the Secretary of State from placing the referendum petition on the upcoming primary ballot because the Secretary of State had not been alleged to have been acting beyond that office’s powers.

        On appeal from the public service commission, a party invokes the appellate and not the original jurisdiction of the district court, so that, even though the district court has statutory power to try the case anew, the appeal does not grant the court power to determine the case where the public service commission did not have jurisdiction.

        The district court, on appeal from county court order, has only the same jurisdiction as the county court, and, therefore, when the district court determines that the county court exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the order appealed from, it may not review and correct such order in its appellate capacity. The only ways in which the district court may acquire jurisdiction over such matter are (1) through the bringing of an independent action for that purpose, or (2) through agreement by the party litigants to invoke the original jurisdiction of the district court in the matter.

        The district courts and district judges have original jurisdiction in proceedings in quo warranto and, except in exceptional cases, application must be made to the district court before invoking the original jurisdiction of the supreme court.

       <p>
        Statute providing that the remedies formerly attainable by writ of quo warranto could be obtained by a civil action in the district court did not abolish such writ, but was a cumulative and additional procedure to permit the same result in a civil action.

        The United States District Court for the District of North Dakota concludes that N.D. Const. art. VI, § 11 is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest as its purpose is to offer a guarantee to parties that the judge will apply the law in the same manner that would be applied to any other litigant. When a judge may have a particular bias or prejudice, the recusal provision requires the judge to remove himself or herself from the case.

        A party litigant was not entitled to have one of the members of the supreme court adjudged disqualified and to have the remaining members call a district judge to sit in his stead on the ground that the member sought to be disqualified, in a former action between the same parties, had expressed an opinion, upon the record then presented, which bore upon the rights of the parties in this action.

Const. art. VII, § 2, regarding political subdivisions, and N.D. Const. art. VII, § 6, regarding home-rule entities, the legislature was authorized to delegate power to a home-rule county to create ordinance violation criminal penalties.

        Where a deputy lost an election for sheriff and was terminated by the sheriff, the sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity as to the deputy's First Amendment retaliation claim because, inter alia, the deputy was employed as an agent of the sheriff, a North Dakota sheriff, in the light of pre-existing law, could, and perhaps should, believe that the deputies are “at will employees,” and the sheriff could have reasonably believed that the speech would be at least potentially damaging to and disruptive of the discipline and harmony of and among co-workers.

        County exceeded its authority in enacting a zoning ordinance regulating animal feeding operations because the ordinance regulated more than the location of a feeding operation, the type of animals, and size of the operation. State law explicitly limited the county’s authority to regulate animal feeding operations and provided that the county could do no more than regulate the location of the operation, size of operation and type of animal.

        Although no one of the various statutes for distributing funding for primary or secondary education, by itself, is unconstitutional, nor does the constitution require equal dollar funding per pupil throughout the state, the impact of the distribution of funding does not bear a close correspondence to the goals of providing an equal educational opportunity and of supporting elementary and secondary education from state funds based on educational costs per pupil; therefore, the overall impact of the entire statutory method for distributing funding for education in North Dakota is unconstitutional.

        Plain and unambiguous language of a settlement agreement between the State Board of Higher Education and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, when construed as a whole and in conjunction with the Board’s authority, did not require the Board or the University of North Dakota to continue using the “Fighting Sioux” nickname and logo until November 30, 2010.

All property, real or personal, received by the state from whatever source, for any specific educational or charitable institution, unless otherwise designated by the donor, must be and remain a perpetual trust fund for the creation and maintenance of such institution, and may be commingled only with similar funds for the same institution. If a gift is made to an institution for a specific purpose, without designating a trustee, the gift may be placed in the institution’s fund; provided that such a donation may be expended as the terms of the gift provide. Revenues earned by a perpetual trust fund must be deposited in the fund. The costs of administering a perpetual trust fund may be paid out of the fund. The perpetual trust funds must be managed to preserve their purchasing power and to maintain stable distributions to fund beneficiaries.

     <p>
      Distributions from the common schools trust fund, together with the net proceeds of all fines for violation of state laws and all other sums which may be added by law, must be faithfully used and applied each year for the benefit of the common schools of the state and no part of the fund must ever be diverted, even temporarily, from this purpose or used for any purpose other than the maintenance of common schools as provided by law. Distributions from an educational or charitable institution’s trust fund must be faithfully used and applied each year for the benefit of the institution and no part of the fund may ever be diverted, even temporarily, from this purpose or used for any purpose other than the maintenance of the institution, as provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the biennium during which this amendment takes effect, distributions from the perpetual trust funds must be the greater of the amount distributed in the preceding biennium or ten percent of the five-year average value of trust assets, excluding the value of lands and minerals. Thereafter, biennial distributions from the perpetual trust funds must be ten percent of the five-year average value of trust assets, excluding the value of lands and minerals. The average value of trust assets is determined by using the assets’ ending value for the fiscal year that ends one year before the beginning of the biennium and the assets’ ending value for the four preceding fiscal years. Equal amounts must be distributed during each year of the biennium.

     </h3>
     <p>
      No original grant school or institutional land shall be sold for less than the fair market value thereof, and in no case for less than ten dollars ($10.00) per acre, provided that when lands have been sold on contract and the contract has been canceled, such lands may be resold without reappraisement by the board of appraisal. The purchaser shall pay twenty (20) percent of the purchase price at the time the contract is executed; thereafter annual payments shall be made of not less than six (6) percent of the original purchase price. An amount equal to not less than three (3) percent per annum of the unpaid principal shall be credited to interest and the balance shall be applied as payment on principal as credit on purchase price. The purchaser may pay all or any installment or installments not yet due to any interest paying date. If the purchaser so desires, he may pay the entire balance due on his contract with interest to date of payment at any time and he will then be entitled to proper conveyance.
     </p>
     <p>
      All sales shall be held at the county seat of the county in which the land to be sold is situated, and shall be at public auction and to the highest bidder, and notice of such sale shall be published once each week for a period of three weeks prior to the day of sale in a legal newspaper published nearest the land and in the newspaper designated for the publication of the official proceedings and legal notices within the county in which said land is situated.
     </p>
     <p>
      No grant or patent for such lands shall issue until payment is made for the same; provided that the land contracted to be sold by the state shall be subject to taxation from the date of the contract. In case the taxes assessed against any of said lands for any year remain unpaid until the first Monday in October of the following year, the contract of sale for such land shall, if the board of university and school lands so determine, by it, be declared null and void. No contract of sale heretofore made under the provisions of this section of the constitution as then providing shall be affected by this amendment, except prepayment of principal may be made as herein provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any of said lands that may be required for townsite purposes, schoolhouse sites, church sites, cemetery sites, sites for other educational or charitable institutions, public parks, airplane landing fields, fairgrounds, public highways, railroad right of way, or other railroad uses and purposes, reservoirs for the storage of water for irrigation, irrigation canals, and ditches, drainage ditches, or for any of the purposes for which private lands may be taken under the right of eminent domain under the constitution and laws of this state, may be sold under the provisions of this article, and shall be paid for in full at the time of sale, or at any time thereafter as herein provided. Any of said lands and any other lands controlled by the board of university and school lands, including state coal mineral interests, may, with the approval of said board, be exchanged for lands and coal mineral interests of the United States, the state of North Dakota or any county or municipality thereof as the legislature may provide, and the lands so acquired shall be subject to the trust to which the lands exchanged therefor were subject, and the state shall reserve all mineral and water power rights in land so transferred, except coal mineral interests approved for exchange by the board of university and school lands under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      When any of said lands have been heretofore or may be hereafter sold on contract, and the purchaser or his heirs or assigns is unable to pay in full for the land purchased within twenty years after the date of purchase and such contract is in default and subject to being declared null and void as by law provided, the board of university and school lands may, after declaring such contract null and void, resell the land described in such contract to such purchaser, his heirs or assigns, for the amount of the unpaid principal, together with interest thereon reckoned to the date of such resale at the rate of not less than three (3%) percent, but in no case shall the resale price be more than the original sale price; such contract of resale shall be upon the terms herein provided, provided this section shall be deemed self-executing insofar as the provisions for resale herein made are concerned.

        A tax is an enforced contribution for public purposes. If the primary purpose of the exaction is revenue, it is a tax. If, on the other hand, its primary purpose is regulation, it is not a tax. Scott v. Donnelly, 133 N.W.2d 418, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1965).

       Section 3. [Legal basis for taxes]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No tax shall be levied except in pursuance of law, and every law imposing a tax shall state distinctly the object of the same, to which only it shall be applied. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions of this constitution, the legislative assembly, in any law imposing a tax or taxes on, in respect to or measured by income, may define the income on, in respect to or by which such tax or taxes are imposed or measured or may define the tax itself by reference to any provision of the laws of the United States as the same may be or become effective at any time or from time to time, and may prescribe exceptions or modifications to any such provision.

        For an equal protection analysis of arguments based primarily upon an underlying assertion that N.D.C.C. ch. 14-06.1, creates a separate class of citizens in a vague way and confers upon displaced homemakers special privileges not available to everyone, see Gange v.

        Money obtained under a statute authorizing a tax to create a permanent surplus in the hail insurance fund cannot be diverted to any other use. Brye v. Dale, 64 N.D. 41, 250 N.W. 99, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute transferring the excess over the permanent surplus in the hail insurance revolving fund to the state equalization fund to be expended for schools does not violate the provision of this section limiting the application of the tax to the stated object for which it was imposed. State ex rel. Sathre v. Hopton, 66 N.D. 313, 265 N.W. 395, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1936).

       <p>
        N.D.C.C. ch. 14-06.1 sets out specific programs and services to be funded by the marriage dissolution fee, defines displaced homemakers who are eligible for services, and specifically states how the object of the tax will be accomplished; thus, even if this section requires a narrowly defined statutory objective, N.D.C.C. ch. 14-06.1 “distinctly” states the object of the tax. Gange v. Clerk of Burleigh County Dist. Court, 429 N.W.2d 429, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A rational basis standard was applied to a constitutional challenge to the marriage dissolution fee because no inherently suspect classification was involved, nor, for all purposes, does the right to divorce constitute a fundamental right. Gange v. Clerk of Burleigh County Dist. Court, 429 N.W.2d 429, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        By directing ninety-five percent of the funds raised by the marriage dissolution fee to be used for “direct provision” of services, the Legislature only intended to cap costs connected with administering the displaced homemakers program at five percent.

     <p>
      Taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of property including franchises within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. The legislative assembly may by law exempt any or all classes of personal property from taxation and within the meaning of this section, fixtures, buildings and improvements of every character, whatsoever, upon land shall be deemed personal property. The property of the United States, to the extent immunity from taxation has not been waived by an act of Congress, property of the state, county, and municipal corporations, to the extent immunity from taxation has not been waived by an act of the legislative assembly, and property used exclusively for schools, religious, cemetery, charitable or other public purposes shall be exempt from taxation. Real property used for conservation or wildlife purposes is not exempt from taxation unless an exemption is provided by the legislative assembly. Except as restricted by this article, the legislative assembly may provide for raising revenue and fixing the situs of all property for the purpose of taxation. Provided that all taxes and exemptions in force when this amendment is adopted shall remain in force until otherwise provided by statute.

        “Taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of property including franchises within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. The legislature may by law exempt any or all classes of personal property from taxation and within the meaning of this section, fixtures, buildings and improvements of every character, whatsoever, upon land shall be deemed personal property. The property of the United States and of the state, county and municipal corporations and property used exclusively for schools, religious, cemetery, charitable or other public purposes shall be exempt from taxation. Except as restricted by this article, the legislature may provide for raising revenue and fixing the situs of all property for the purpose of taxation. Provided that all taxes and exemptions in force when this amendment is adopted shall remain in force until otherwise provided by statute”.

       <p>
        The 1914 amendment of this section read:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Taxes shall be uniform upon the same class of property, including franchises within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected for public purposes only, but the property of the United States, and of the state, county and municipal corporations, shall be exempt from taxation; and the legislative assembly shall by a general law exempt from taxation property used exclusively for school, religious, cemetery, charitable or other public purposes, and personal property to any amount not exceeding in value two hundred dollars for each individual liable to taxation; provided, that all taxes and exemptions in force when this amendment is adopted shall remain in force, in the same manner and to the same extent, until otherwise provided by statute”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1905 amendment of this section added the following language:
       </p>
       <p>
        “The legislative assembly may further provide that grain grown within the state and held therein in elevators, warehouses and granaries may be taxed at a fixed rate”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The section as originally adopted read:
       </p>
       <p>
        “Laws shall be passed taxing by uniform rule all property according to its true value in money, but the property of the United States and the State, county and municipal corporations, both real and personal, shall be exempt from taxation, and the Legislative Assembly shall by a general law exempt from taxation property used exclusively for school, religious, cemetery or charitable purposes and personal property to any amount not exceeding in value two hundred dollars for each individual liable to taxation; but the Legislative Assembly may, by law, provide for the payment of a per centum of gross earnings of railroad companies to be paid in lieu of all state, county, township and school taxes on property exclusively used in and about the prosecution of the business of such companies as common carriers, but no real estate of said corporations shall be exempted from taxation, in the same manner, and on the same basis as other real estate is taxed, except roadbed, right of way, shops and buildings used exclusively in their business as common carriers, and whenever and so long as such law providing for the payment of a per centum on earnings shall be in force, that part of section 179 of this article relating to assessment of railroad property shall cease to be in force”.

        “No future indebtedness shall be incurred by the state unless evidenced by a bond issue, which shall be authorized by law for certain purposes, to be clearly defined. Every law authorizing a bond issue shall provide for levying an annual tax, or make other provision, sufficient to pay the interest semi-annually, and the principal within thirty years from the passage of such law, and shall specially appropriate the proceeds of such tax, or of such other provisions, to the payment of said principal and interest, and such appropriation shall not be repealed nor the tax or other provisions discontinued until such debt, both principal and interest, shall have been paid.

        The section as originally adopted read:
       </p>
       <p>
        “The state may, to meet casual deficits or failure in the revenue, or in case of extraordinary emergencies, contract debts, but such debts shall never in the aggregate exceed the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, exclusive of what may be the debt of North Dakota at the time of the adoption of this Constitution. Every such debt shall be authorized by law for certain purposes to be definitely mentioned therein, and every such law shall provide for levying an annual tax sufficient to pay the interest semi-annually, and the principal within thirty years from the passage of such law, and shall specially appropriate the proceeds of such tax to the payment of said principal and interest, and such appropriation shall not be repealed nor the tax discontinued until such debt, both principal and interest, shall have been fully paid. No debt in excess of the limit named shall be incurred except for the purpose of repelling invasion, suppressing insurrection, defending the state in time of war, or to provide for public defense in case of threatened hostilities; but the issuing of new bonds to refund existing indebtedness, shall not be construed to be any part or portion of said two hundred thousand dollars”.

       Notwithstanding any other provision in the constitution, and for the purpose of promoting the economic growth of the state, the development of its natural resources, and the prosperity and welfare of its people, the state may issue bonds and use the proceeds thereof to make loans to privately or cooperatively owned enterprises to plan, construct, acquire, equip, improve, and extend facilities for converting natural resources into power and generating and transmitting such power, and to acquire real and personal property and water and mineral rights needed for such facilities.

       The state may issue general obligation bonds for this purpose to an amount which, with all outstanding general obligation bonds, less the amount of all money on hand and taxes in process of collection which are appropriated for their payment, will not exceed five percent of the full and true value of all of the taxable property in the state, to be ascertained by the last assessment made for state and county purposes: but nothing herein shall increase or diminish the limitations established by other provisions of the constitution on the amount of bonds therein authorized to be issued.

      <li id="constitution-nda0Xs14ol13">
       The state may also issue revenue bonds for the purpose of providing part or all of the funds required for any project undertaken under subsection 1, payable solely from sums realized from payments of principal and interest on money loaned for such project, and from other similar projects if so determined by the legislature, and from the liquidation of security given for such payments. Revenue bonds issued for any project shall not exceed the cost thereof, including all expenses reasonably incurred to complete and finance the project, but shall not be subject to any other limitation of amount.
      </li>
      <li id="constitution-nda0Xs14ol14">
       The full faith and credit of the state shall be pledged for the prompt and full payment of all bonds issued under subsection 2. Its obligation with respect to bonds issued under subsection 3 shall be limited to the prompt and full performance of such covenants as the legislature may authorize to be made respecting the enforcing of the provisions of underlying loan agreements and the segregation, accounting, and application of bond proceeds and of loan payments and other security pledged for the payment of the bonds. All bonds authorized by subsections 1 to 3, inclusive, shall mature within forty years from their respective dates of issue, but may be refunded at or before maturity in such manner and for such term and upon such conditions as the legislature may direct. Any such bonds may, but need not be, secured by mortgage upon real or personal property acquired with the proceeds of the same or any other issue of general obligation or revenue bonds, or upon other property mortgaged by the debtor. Pledges of revenues and mortgages of property securing bonds of any issue may be prior or subordinate to or on a parity with pledges and mortgages securing any other issue of general obligation or revenue bonds, as determined by the legislature from time to time in conformity with any provisions made for the security of outstanding bonds.

        A warrant issued for current county expenses in anticipation of the proceeds of a lawful levy is valid, although it is beyond the limit of indebtedness. Darling v. Taylor, 7 N.D. 538, 75 N.W. 766, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1898).

        In ascertaining whether the debt limit has been exceeded by a school district, funds in the treasury available for meeting liabilities, and taxes levied and uncollected may be considered, but the district officers have no right to anticipate revenues to be derived from tax levies in future years.

       <p>
        The assessed valuation of a taxing district at the time when an indebtedness is incurred is the assessed valuation to be used in computing the constitutional debt limit. Jones v. Brightwood Indep. Sch. Dist., 63 N.D. 275, 247 N.W. 884, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 1933).

        The fact that the assessed valuation of a taxing district shrinks so that the outstanding warrants are beyond the debt limitation does not render legally issued warrants invalid. Jones v.

        The clause “but neither the state nor any political subdivision thereof shall otherwise *
   *
   *” contained in this section means “on the contrary, the state or any political subdivision thereof may not in any other way *
   *
   *”. In the clause the word “but” is used conjunctively in the sense of “on the contrary” and connects two clauses of the sentence so that it makes the last one modify the first, and indicates that that following is an exception to that which has gone before and is not controlled by it. The word “shall” directs a negative and provides a limitation by the words that follow it upon that which has been said before, so in order to give effect to the intent it must be construed as “may”. The word “otherwise” means in a different way, in another manner, and refers to what has gone before. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Wentz, 103 N.W.2d 245, 1960 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Supreme Court of North Dakota had the power to adopt N.D. Admis. Prac. R. 13 and to exempt processes regarding admission to the bar from public disclosure; mandamus relief was denied to an unsuccessful bar applicant seeking bar records because Rule 13 was neither subordinate to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.44.html#t44c44-04s44-04-18" target="_blank">44-04-18</a></cite> nor unconstitutional under N.D.

        For an exception to the open-records law to exist, it must be specific, i.e., the Legislature must directly address the status of the record in question, for a specific exception, by the plain terms of those provisions, may not be implied. Therefore, the contention that an exception to the open-records law for teacher personnel files should be implied from former N.D.C.C. §
   15-47-38 must fail. Hovet v. Hebron Pub. Sch. Dist., 419 N.W.2d 189, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>
        The open records law does not define “record” to indicate what is subject to inspection; the term “record” should be given an expansive meaning and is not limited to those records which are required by law to be kept and maintained. Further, once it has been determined an entity falls under a category of organization subject to the law, all records of the entity are open to inspection. Adams County Record v. Greater N.D. Ass'n, 529 N.W.2d 830, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        Where the requirement that information in a public utility’s tariff be available for public inspection was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of policing irregularities in the handling of public matters affecting the rates paid by citizens for an essential commodity, a natural gas distributor could have had no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that the price and volume data in its tariff would not be available for public inspection, and therefore, no governmental “taking” would be implicated by requiring disclosure.

        An act providing for the distribution of the avails of a life insurance policy, or any benefit payable by a mutual aid or benevolent society, to the heirs, or heirs at law, of a decedent, and exempting the same from payment of debts, does not conflict with this section.

        The legislative, executive, and judicial branches are coequal branches of government, and each branch is supreme in its own sphere; the creation of the three branches of government by the Constitution operates as an apportionment of the different classes of power whereby there is an implied exclusion of each branch from the exercise of the functions of the others.

       The legislature may take cognizance of monetary inflation, and, in order to compensate for it, may increase the expense allowances of state officials during their terms in office without violating this section; however, cost-of-living increases must not exceed amounts reasonably necessary to cover actual increases in costs, and to the extent that they do, they are unconstitutional.

       The people of North Dakota need information to choose candidates for office, vote on ballot measures, and ensure that their representatives are accountable. This transparency must be sufficient to enable the people to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages. The people therefore have the right to know in a timely manner the source, quantity, timing, and nature of resources used to influence any statewide election, election for the legislative assembly, statewide ballot-issue election, and state government action. This right is essential to the rights of free speech, assembly, and petition guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and shall be construed broadly.

The legislative assembly shall have an ongoing duty to revise these laws as necessary to promote the purposes of this section in light of changes in technology and political practices. The legislative assembly shall vest by law one or more entities with authority to implement, interpret, and enforce this section and legislation enacted thereunder. If the laws or rules enacted or an implementation, interpretation, or enforcement action taken under this section fail to fully vindicate the rights provided in this section, a resident taxpayer may bring suit in the courts of this state to enforce such rights.

     <p>
      Repealed by art. amd. 105, approved November 7, 1978 (S.L. 1977, ch. 613, § 3; 1979, ch. 696), effective January 1, 1979. See Article III, §§ 1 to 10, of the renumbered constitution.
     </p>
     <p>
      The section as amended by art. amd. 81, approved November 3, 1964 (S.L. 1963, ch. 451; 1965, ch. 476, § 1) read:
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative power of this state shall be vested in a legislature consisting of a senate and a house of representatives. The people, however, reserve the power, first, to propose measures and to enact or reject the same at the polls; second, to approve or reject at the polls any measure or any item, section, part or parts of any measure enacted by the legislature.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first power reserved is the initiative. Ten thousand electors at large may propose any measure by initiative petition. Every such petition shall contain the full text of the measure and shall be filed with the Secretary of State not less than ninety days before the election at which it is to be voted upon.
     </p>
     <p>
      The second power reserved is the referendum. Seven thousand electors at large may, by referendum petition, suspend the operation of any measure enacted by the legislature, except an emergency measure. But the filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections or parts of any measure, shall not prevent the remainder from going into effect. Such petition shall be filed with the Secretary of State not later than ninety days after the adjournment of the session of the legislature at which such measure was enacted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each measure initiated by or referred to the electors, shall be submitted by its ballot title, which shall be placed upon the ballot by the Secretary of State and shall be voted upon at any state-wide election designated in the petition, or at a special election called by the Governor. The result of the vote upon any measure shall be canvassed and declared by the board of canvassers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any measure, except an emergency measure, submitted to the electors of the state, shall become a law when approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon. And such law shall go into effect on the thirtieth day after the election, unless otherwise specified in the measure.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a referendum petition is filed against an emergency measure such measure shall be a law until voted upon by the electors. And if it is then rejected by a majority of the votes cast thereon, it shall be thereby repealed. Any such measure shall be submitted to the electors at a special election if so ordered by the Governor, or if the referendum petition filed against it shall be signed by thirty thousand electors at large. Such special election shall be called by the Governor, and shall be held not less than one hundred nor more than one hundred thirty days after the adjournment of the session of the legislature.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of State shall pass upon each petition, and if he finds it insufficient, he shall notify the “Committee for the Petitioners” and allow twenty days for correction or amendment. All decisions of the Secretary of State in regard to any such petition shall be subject to review by the supreme court. But if the sufficiency of such petition is being reviewed at the time the ballot is prepared, the Secretary of State shall place the measure on the ballot and no subsequent decision shall invalidate such measure if it is at such election approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon. If proceedings are brought against any petition upon any ground, the burden of proof shall be upon the party attacking it.
     </p>
     <p>
      No law shall be enacted limiting the number of copies of a petition which may be circulated. Such copies shall become a part of the original petition when filed or attached thereto. Nor shall any law be enacted prohibiting any person from giving or receiving compensation for circulating the petitions, nor in any manner interfering with the freedom in securing signatures to petitions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each petition shall have printed thereon a ballot title, which shall fairly represent the subject matter of the measure, and the names of at least five electors who shall constitute the “committee for the petitioners” and who shall represent and act for the petitioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      The enacting clause of all measures initiated by the electors shall be: “Be it enacted by the people of the State of North Dakota.” In submitting measures to the electors, the Secretary of State and all other officials shall be guided by the election laws until additional legislation shall be provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      If conflicting measures initiated by or referred to the electors shall be approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon, the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall become the law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The word “measure” as used herein shall include any law or amendment thereto, resolution, legislative proposal or enactment of any character.
     </p>
     <p>
      The veto power of the Governor shall not extend to the measures initiated by or referred to the electors. No measure enacted or approved by a vote of the electors shall be repealed or amended by the legislature, except upon a yea and nay vote upon roll call of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall be self executing and all of its provisions treated as mandatory. Laws may be enacted to facilitate its operation, but no laws shall be enacted to hamper, restrict or impair the exercise of the rights herein reserved to the people.
     </p>
     <p>
      The section as amended by art. amd. 26, approved November 5, 1918 (S.L. 1919, ch. 88) read:
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative power of this state shall be vested in a legislature consisting of a senate and a house of representatives. The people, however, reserve the power, first, to propose measures and to enact or reject the same at the polls; second, to approve or reject at the polls any measure or any item, section, part or parts of any measure enacted by the legislature.

Such petition shall be filed with the Secretary of State not later than ninety days after the adjournment of the session of the legislature at which such measure was enacted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each measure initiated by or referred to the electors, shall be submitted by its ballot title, which shall be placed upon the ballot by the Secretary of State and shall be voted upon at any statewide election designated in the petition, or at a special election called by the Governor. The result of the vote upon any measure shall be canvassed and declared by the board of canvassers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any measure, except an emergency measure, submitted to the electors of the state, shall become a law when approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon. And such law shall go into effect on the 30th day after the election, unless otherwise specified in the measure.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a referendum petition is filed against an emergency measure, such measure shall be a law until voted upon by the electors. And if it is then rejected by a majority of the votes cast thereon, it shall be thereby repealed. Any such measure shall be submitted to the electors at a special election if so ordered by the Governor, or if the referendum petition filed against it shall be signed by thirty thousand electors at large.

But if the sufficiency of such petition is being reviewed at the time the ballot is prepared, the Secretary of State shall place the measure on the ballot and no subsequent decision shall invalidate such measure if it is at such election approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon. If proceedings are brought against any petition upon any ground, the burden of proof shall be upon the party attacking it.
     </p>
     <p>
      No law shall be enacted limiting the number of copies of a petition which may be circulated. Such copies shall become a part of the original petition when filed or attached thereto. Nor shall any law be enacted prohibiting any person from giving or receiving compensation for circulating the petitions, nor in any manner interfering with the freedom in securing signatures to petitions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each petition shall have printed thereon a ballot title, which shall fairly represent the subject matter of the measure, and the names of at least five electors who shall constitute the “committee for petitioners” and who shall represent and act for the petitioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      All measures submitted to the electors shall be published by the state as follows: “The Secretary of State shall cause to be printed and mailed to each elector a publicity pamphlet, containing a copy of each measure together with its ballot title, to be submitted at any election. Any citizen, or the officers of any organization, may submit to the Secretary of State for publication in such pamphlet, arguments concerning any measure therein, upon first subscribing their names and addresses thereto and paying the fee therefor, which, until otherwise fixed by the legislature, shall be the sum of two hundred dollars per page.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The enacting clause of all measures initiated by the electors shall be: “Be it enacted by the people of the State of North Dakota.” In submitting measures to the electors, the Secretary of State and all other officials shall be guided by the election laws until additional legislation shall be provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      If conflicting measures initiated by or referred to the electors shall be approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon, the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall become the law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The word “measure” as used herein shall include any law or amendment thereto, resolution, legislative proposal or enactment of any character.
     </p>
     <p>
      The veto power of the Governor shall not extend to the measures initiated by or referred to the electors. No measure enacted or approved by a vote of the electors shall be repealed or amended by the legislature, except upon a yea and nay vote upon roll call of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section shall be self executing and all of its provisions treated as mandatory. Laws may be enacted to facilitate its operation, but no laws shall be enacted to hamper, restrict or impair the exercise of the rights herein reserved to the people.
     </p>
     <p>
      The section as amended by art. amd. 15, approved November 3, 1914 (S.L. 1911, ch. 93; 1913, ch. 101 read:
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative authority of the State of North Dakota shall be vested in a (the) legislative assembly consisting of a senate and house of representatives, but the people reserve to themselves (the) power to propose laws and to enact or (and) reject the same at the polls, independent of the legislative assembly, and also reserve power, at their own option, to approve or reject at the polls any act, item, section or part of any act or measure passed by the legislative assembly. The first power reserved by the people is the initiative, or the power to propose measures for enactment into laws, and at least ten per cent of the legal voters to be secured in a majority of the counties of this state shall be required to propose any measure by initiative petition, and every such petition shall include the full text of the measure so proposed. Initiative petitions shall be filed with the Secretary of State not less than thirty days before any regular session of the legislative assembly; he shall transmit the same to the legislative assembly as soon as it convenes. Such initiative measure shall take precedence over all other measures in the legislative assembly except appropriation bills, and shall be either enacted or rejected without change or amendment by the legislative assembly within forty days. If any such initiative measures shall be enacted by the legislative assembly it shall be subject to referendum petition, or it may be referred by the legislative assembly to the people for approval or rejection. If it is rejected or no action is taken upon it by the legislative assembly within said forty days, the Secretary of State shall submit it to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular general election. The legislative assembly may reject any measure so proposed by initiative petition and propose a different one to accomplish the same purpose, and in any such event both measures shall be submitted by the Secretary of State to the people for approval or rejection at the next ensuing regular election. If conflicting measures submitted to the people at the next ensuing election shall be approved by a majority of the votes severally cast for and against the same, the one receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall thereby become valid and the other shall thereby be rejected. The second power is the referendum, or the power to order any act, item, or part of any act to be referred to the people for their approval or rejection at the polls, and it may be ordered (except as to laws necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety), as to any measure or any parts, items or sections of any measures passed by the legislative assembly either by a petition signed by ten per cent of the legal voters of the state from a majority of the counties or by the legislative assembly, if a majority of the members-elect vote therefor. When it is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety that a law shall become effective without delay, such necessity and the facts creating the same shall be stated in one section of the bill, and if upon aye and nay vote in each house two-thirds of all the members elected to each house shall vote on a separate roll call in favor of the said law going into instant operation for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety, such law shall become operative upon approval by the Governor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The filing of a referendum petition against one or more items, sections or parts of an act shall not delay the remainder of that act from becoming operative. Referendum petitions against measures passed by the legislative assembly shall be filed with the Secretary of State not more than ninety days after the final adjournment of the session of the legislative assembly which passed the measure on which the referendum is demanded. The veto power of the Governor shall not extent to measures referred to the people. All elections on measures referred to the people of the state shall be had at biennial regular elections, except as provision(s) may be made by law for a special election or elections. Any measure referred to the people shall take effect when it is approved by a majority of the votes cast thereon and not otherwise and shall be in force from the date of the official declaration of the vote.
     </p>
     <p>
      The enacting clause of all initiative bills shall be “Be it enacted by the people of the State of North Dakota.” This Section shall not be construed to deprive any member of the legislative assembly of the right to introduce any measure. The whole number of votes cast for Secretary of State at the regular election last preceding the filing of any petition for the initiative or for the referendum shall be the basis on which the number of legal voters necessary to sign such petition shall be counted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petitions and orders for the initiative and for the referendum shall be filed with the Secretary of State, and in submitting the same to the people he and all other officers shall be guided by the general laws and the acts submitting this amendment until legislation shall be especially provided therefor.
     </p>
     <p>
      This amendment shall be self-executing, but legislation may be enacted to facilitate its operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The section as originally adopted read:
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative power shall be vested in a Senate and house of representatives.

        A summary contempt proceeding for a criminal contempt committed in open court is not a prosecution within the meaning of this section of the constitution. State v. Crum, 7 N.D. 299, 74 N.W. 992, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1898).

        “State of North Dakota vs. A.B.” is sufficient to show that a prosecution is carried on in the name, and by the authority, of the state. State v. Kerr, 3 N.D. 523, 58 N.W. 27, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 1894).

        This section does not prohibit a trial de novo in district court upon an appeal from county court in probate and testamentary matters. In re Peterson's Estate, 22 N.D. 480, 134 N.W. 751, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 47</cite> (N.D. 1912).

       <p>
        This section confers upon the county court exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of claims against an estate. Johnson v. Rutherford, 28 N.D. 87, 147 N.W. 390, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court has no jurisdiction to determine the validity of or rights under a contract made for the benefit of a third person; thus where one asserts a claim against the estate and it is disallowed by the county court, the rights thereunder are determined by the district court. Ceglowski v. Zachor, 102 F. Supp. 513, 1951 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3823 (D.N.D. 1951).

         Decree.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A final decree of distribution entered by the county court is of equal rank with a judgment entered in other courts of record in the state; and it imports the same degree of verity and the same presumptions exist in its favor. Fischer v. Dolwig, 29 N.D. 561, 151 N.W. 431, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 31</cite> (N.D. 1915); Dolphin v. Peterson, 63 N.D. 792, 249 N.W. 784, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court has no authority to vacate or open a final decree after the expiration of one year from its entry. Reichert v. Reichert, 41 N.D. 253, 170 N.W. 621, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        The final decree of distribution is a final judgment, from which an appeal may be taken within thirty days. In re Estate of Nystuen, 80 N.W.2d 671, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite>, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1956).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A county court of increased jurisdiction has no equity powers, its jurisdiction being limited to actions at law. Mead v. First Nat'l Bank, 24 N.D. 12, 138 N.W. 365, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute authorizing the county court to direct an administrator to execute a deed under the decedent’s sale contract does not confer equity jurisdiction. FOX v. FOX, 57 N.D. 368, 221 N.W. 889, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court has no jurisdiction to determine whether a contract to adopt children was made, the extent and terms of such contract, and whether it was executed by the one agreeing to adopt, even though the question arises during administration of an estate. Muhlhauser v. Becker, 74 N.D. 103, 20 N.W.2d 353, 1945 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D. 1945).

       <p>
        The county court is without authority to try or determine any question of fraud or coercion raised in connection with a compromise agreement between claimants to an estate. MUHLHAUSER v. BECKER, 76 N.D. 402, 37 N.W.2d 352, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1949).

        The county court has exclusive, original jurisdiction in the sale of land by guardians. In re Druhl's Estate, 61 N.D. 168, 237 N.W. 697, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 260</cite> (N.D. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court has exclusive original jurisdiction of the appointment of a guardian for an incompetent person and estate, and in so doing it may exercise a wide degree of discretion.

       </p>
       <p>
        The county court does not have the power to appoint a guardian ad litem. Shuck v. Shuck, 77 N.D. 628, 44 N.W.2d 767, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1950).

        It is beyond the power of the assembly to confer upon the county courts power to inventory and distribute insurance proceeds which are not a part of the decedent’s estate even though payable to a decedent’s heirs.

        The statute relating to the distribution of the proceeds of a life insurance policy does not confer jurisdiction on the county court contrary to the constitution. Talcott v. Bailey, 54 N.D. 19, 208 N.W. 549, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 107</cite> (N.D. 1926).

     </p>
     <p>
      The Legislative Assembly shall provide by law for the election of justices of the peace in each organized county within the state. But the number of said justices to be elected in each organized county shall be limited by law to such a number as shall be necessary for the proper administration of justice. The justices of the peace herein provided for shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the district court in all civil actions when the amount in controversy, exclusive of costs, does not exceed two hundred dollars, and in counties where no county court with criminal jurisdiction exists they shall have such jurisdiction to hear and determine cases of misdemeanor as may be provided by law, but in no case shall said justices of the peace have jurisdiction when the boundaries of or title to real estate shall come in question. The Legislative Assembly shall have power to abolish the office of justice of the peace and confer that jurisdiction upon judges of County Courts, or elsewhere.

The principal of every such fund may be increased but shall never be diminished, and the interest and income only shall be used. Every such fund shall be deemed a trust fund held by the state, and the state shall make good all losses thereof.

        Where lands are granted to the state by Congress for educational purposes, the proceeds from the sale thereof constitute a permanent trust fund, the interest and income of which can be used only by the state for the support of schools designated in the constitution.

      Repealed by art. amd. 55, approved June 25, 1940 (S.L. 1941, p. 588). The section as originally adopted read:
     </p>
     <p>
      In any county that shall have adopted a system of government by the chairmen of the several township boards, the question of continuing the same may be submitted to the electors of such county at a general election in such a manner as may be provided by law, and if a majority of all the votes cast upon such question, shall be against said system of government, then such system shall cease in said county and the affairs of said county shall then be transacted by a board of county commissioners as is now provided by the laws of the territory of Dakota.

     <p>
      The qualified electors of the state or of any county, or of any congressional, judicial or legislative district may petition for the recall any elective congressional, state, county, judicial or legislative officer by filing a petition with the officer with whom the petition for nomination to such office in the primary election is filed, demanding the recall of such officer. Such petition shall be signed by at least thirty percent of the qualified electors who voted at the preceding election for the office of Governor in the state, county or district from which such officer is to be recalled. The officer with whom such petition is filed shall call a special election to be held not less than forty or more than forty-five days from the filing of such petition.
     </p>
     <p>
      The officer against whom such petition has been filed shall continue to perform the duties of his office until the result of such special election shall have been officially declared. Other candidates for such office may be nominated in the manner as is provided by law in primary elections. The candidate who shall receive the highest number of votes shall be deemed elected for the remainder of the term. The name of the candidate against whom the recall petition is filed shall go on the ticket unless he resigns within ten days after the filing of the petition. After one such petition and special election, no further recall petition shall be filed against the same officer during the term for which he was elected. This article shall be self executing and all of its provisions shall be treated as mandatory. Laws may be enacted to facilitate its operation, but no law shall be enacted to hamper, restrict or impair the right of recall.
