     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no warrant purporting to be drawn upon the funds in the hands of the treasurer of any taxing district may be issued in excess of the amount of cash in the hands of the treasurer exclusive of sinking funds and funds for the payment of interest upon bond issues. No indebtedness may be incurred, and no undertakings or expenditures authorized, in excess of unencumbered uncollected taxes which have been levied during the current year plus the unencumbered uncollected taxes of the four preceding years. Any warrant issued, contract entered into, or purported indebtedness incurred, in contravention of this section is null and void, but this provision is not intended to detract from the provisions of section 21-02-03 with reference to the incontestability of certificates of indebtedness. Any officer willfully executing or participating in the execution of any warrant or contract or attempting to incur any indebtedness of any such taxing district in contravention of this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. Any officer executing or participating in the execution of any warrant in contravention of this section is personally liable for the payment thereof to the holder in due course.

     <p>
      In case any taxing district is unable to sell its certificates of indebtedness, it may issue warrants in payment of current expenses in excess of cash on hand, but not in excess of eighty-five percent of taxes levied for the fiscal year of issue but uncollected and not otherwise encumbered, plus fifty percent of the uncollected and not otherwise encumbered taxes of the four preceding years, and the funds derived from the collection of taxes for the current year and such preceding years, to the extent that the same have been encumbered, constitute a special fund for the payment of warrants issued against such taxes. If warrants are issued in excess of such limitations, such warrants possess no validity as against the taxing district, but the officials knowingly and willfully issuing the same are liable personally for the payment thereof.

      Whenever the law authorizes the officers of any taxing district to issue warrants in excess of the amount of cash available in any fund upon which warrants are drawn for payment, the treasurer of that taxing district, when any warrant is presented to the treasurer for payment, if not paid for want of funds, shall endorse the same “Presented for payment on , , and not paid for want of funds”, and thereupon shall enter the warrant in the treasurer’s warrant register in the order of presentation for registration. The governing body of a taxing district authorizing the issuance of warrants in excess of cash on hand shall determine the rate of interest which the warrants must bear, but in the case of counties and cities the rate may not exceed eight percent per annum from the date of registration until the expiration of the time specified for presentment for payment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Political subdivisions may borrow against revenues through the issuance of certificates of indebtedness. A certificate of indebtedness consists of an agreement on the part of a political subdivision to pay a stated sum on or before a specified date, together with interest thereon at a rate or rates resulting in an average annual net interest cost not exceeding twelve percent if the certificate is sold privately. There is no interest rate ceiling on a certificate sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The certificate must be signed on behalf of the political subdivision by its president or chairman, or equivalent officer, and also by its auditor, business manager or secretary, or equivalent officer, and must be payable from revenues. A certificate of indebtedness issued wholly or in part against revenues that consist of levied and uncollected taxes is a general obligation of the issuing political subdivision to the extent of the levied and uncollected taxes.

       The authorization of municipalities to issue certificates of indebtedness is based on the power to borrow in anticipation of revenues to be derived from taxes already levied. Tracy v. Barnes County, 69 N.D. 602, 289 N.W. 377, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1939).

    Certificate of county auditor.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A tax is deemed to have been levied when it has been voted by the tax levying board and certified to the county auditor. Each certificate of indebtedness issued wholly or in part against revenues that consist of levied and uncollected taxes must bear the certificate of the county auditor to the effect that it, together with all other outstanding certificates issued wholly or in part against revenues that consist of levied and uncollected taxes, is within the amount of uncollected taxes that have been levied lawfully in the then present year, plus uncollected taxes of the four preceding years. A county auditor who willfully signs a false certificate upon a certificate of indebtedness is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

     <p>
      When a political subdivision issues a certificate of indebtedness under this chapter, the political subdivision, by resolution authorizing the issuance of the certificate of indebtedness, shall establish a sinking fund for the retirement of the certificate of indebtedness, including interest, on its due date. The resolution must also provide for the regular accumulation of money in the sinking fund from the revenues pledged to the payment of the certificate of indebtedness. Upon the accumulation of sufficient money in the sinking fund to pay the principal and interest which will be due and owing on the maturity date of the certificate of indebtedness, no additional revenues may be credited to the sinking fund.

    Direct, annual, irrepealable tax.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governing body of every municipality issuing bonds under the authority of this chapter, before the delivery thereof, shall levy by recorded resolution or ordinance a direct, annual tax which, together with any other moneys provided by, or sources of revenue authorized by, the legislative assembly, shall be sufficient in amount to pay, and for the express purpose of paying, the interest on such bonds as it falls due, and also to pay and discharge the principal thereof at maturity. The municipality shall be and continue without power to repeal such levy or levies or to obstruct the collection of any such tax until such payments have been made or provided for, except that if the governing body in any year makes an irrevocable appropriation to the sinking fund of moneys actually on hand, or if there is on hand in the sinking fund an amount that would be sufficient to retire the bonds, the governing body shall cause its recording officer to certify the fact and amount to the county auditor with the direction that the county auditor should reduce by the amount so certified the amount otherwise to be included in the tax rolls next thereafter prepared. A copy of such resolution or ordinance must be certified to and filed with the county auditor, and after the issuance of such bonds, any such tax on property from year to year must be carried into the tax roll of the municipality and collected as other property taxes are collected. No further annual levy for that purpose is necessary. The governing body may, in its discretion and in anticipation of the sale of bonds, at any time after the issuance of bonds has been authorized by the electors or by resolution of the governing body when no election is required, levy and certify to the county auditor for collection a portion of the tax herein required, which must be credited against the amount otherwise required to be levied after the bonds have been sold. Any other tax or source of revenue authorized by the legislative assembly for such purposes and imposed or pledged by the municipality for those purposes is likewise irrepealable and subject to the same conditions and limitations as any taxes levied on property for the same purposes. Any annual or periodic amounts provided for the municipality issuing such bonds by the legislative assembly out of state funds for paying the interest and principal of such bonds constitute an irrepealable and continuing appropriation until the liability for all interest and principal payments of the bonds have been satisfied. When insufficient funds are available to pay the matured bonds, the county auditor shall notify the governing body of such municipality of such deficiency and the governing body thereupon may levy a direct tax on the taxable property to pay said deficiency and interest thereon. If the governing body of the issuing municipality no longer exists, the county auditor shall levy a direct tax against the taxable property in the original issuing municipality to pay said deficiency and the interest thereon. The manner of levy, certification, and collection of said tax must be the same as provided by this section for the levy, certification, and collection of taxes by this section. When such bonds are further sustained by revenue of a revenue-producing utility, industry, or enterprise, said resolution or ordinance may provide that the tax to be levied and assessed may be reduced by such amount and under such conditions as must be determined in said resolution or ordinance so long as adequate provision is always made for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon.

      Municipal bonds must be executed in the name of and for the municipality issuing them, by its qualified officers, who for that purpose shall sign the same by manual or facsimile signatures in their official capacities, as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>

      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The interest coupons attached to such bonds may be executed by the lithographed or engraved facsimile signature of such officers. The validity of every bond so executed remains unimpaired by the fact that any subscribing officer has ceased to be such officer before delivery to the purchaser. Bonds issued by a municipality having an official seal need not be sealed with such seal. The city auditor, county auditor, clerk, or secretary or such other officer as the governing body of the municipality may determine shall sign an endorsement on the back of each bond certifying that the bond is issued pursuant to law and is within the debt limit of the municipality issuing the bond.

      A notice calling for bids for each proposed issue of municipal bonds must be published at least once in the official newspaper of the municipality, or, if the municipality does not have an official newspaper, then in the county’s official newspaper, not less than ten days nor more than thirty days before the date specified therein for the receiving of such bids. Such notice may be in any form but must specify the amount of bonds offered for sale and the date of the maturity thereof. Failure to publish such notice does not impair the validity of such bonds but renders unenforceable any executory contract entered into for the sale thereof.

Every such fiscal agent must be an incorporated bank or trust company authorized by the laws of the United States or of the state in which it is located to do a banking or trust company business. The custodian of the sinking funds of the municipality, when necessary, shall deposit with such fiscal agent such sums of money as are required for the payment of the principal or interest of municipal bonds.

The county treasurer shall make quarterly reports to the treasurer of the taxing district whose sinking fund the county treasurer possesses, showing all collections and amounts added to each such fund, all payments made from such fund, and the net balance in each such fund from time to time. The county treasurer shall keep the sinking funds of each taxing district on deposit in such public depository as may have furnished proper bond therefor and as may have been designated by the governing board of the taxing district. When a sinking fund is so deposited, the county treasurer is relieved of personal responsibility for its safekeeping.

      The sinking fund must be disbursed by the county treasurer or treasurer of the municipality, as the case may be, upon the directions therefor by resolution of the governing body of the municipality issuing such bonds. As such bonds mature, the county treasurer, upon warrant drawn upon the county treasurer by the county auditor, shall apply such sinking fund in retirement thereof, and also in payment of the interest thereon as it becomes payable. The county auditor shall draw such warrants so as to pay the interest and retire the bonds at as early a date as possible. If the bonds are retired or if the balance in the sinking fund is sufficient to retire the bonds, the county auditor shall notify the governing body of the municipality of its obligation under section 21-03-15 to terminate the levy for payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The county treasurer or treasurer of the municipality may not disburse any of such fund contrary to the provisions of this chapter, even though so directed by such governing body. The county treasurer or treasurer of the municipality may disburse such fund for the purpose of paying the principal and interest, or either, of the bonds for which such fund was created without any authorization therefor by the governing body. The sinking fund of each bond issue must be kept separate and must be designated by a name indicative of the issue of bonds on account of which it was created. The sources of such fund must be:

      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03s21-03-42ol12">

      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol11">
       Each issuer is authorized to establish and maintain a system of registration with respect to each obligation which it issues. The system may either be:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol11a">
         A system pursuant to which only certificated registered public obligations are issued.

         A system pursuant to which both certificated and uncertificated registered public obligations are issued.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol12">
       The system must be established, amended, discontinued, or reinstituted for the issuer by, and must be maintained for the issuer as provided by, the official or official body.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol13">
       The system must be described in the registered public obligation or in the official actions which provide for original issuance of the registered public obligation, and in subsequent official actions providing for amendments and other matters from time to time. Such description may be by reference to a program of the issuer which is established by the official or official body.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol14">
       The system must define the method or methods by which transfer of the registered public obligation shall be effective with respect to the issuer, and by which payment of principal and any interest must be made. The system may permit the issuance of registered public obligations in any denomination to represent several registered public obligations of smaller denominations. The system may also provide for the form of any certificated registered public obligation or of any writing relating to an uncertificated registered public obligation, for identifying numbers or other designations, for a sufficient supply of certificates for subsequent transfers, for record and payment dates, for varying denominations, for communications to holders or owners of obligations, and for accounting, canceled certificate destruction registration and release of security interests and other incidental matters. Unless the issuer otherwise provides, the record date for interest payable on the first or fifteenth day of a month must be the fifteenth day or the last business day of the preceding month, respectively, and for interest payable on other than the first or fifteenth day of a month, must be the fifteenth calendar day before the interest payment date.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol15">
       Under a system pursuant to which both certificated and uncertificated registered public obligations are issued, both types of registered public obligations may be regularly issued, or one type may be regularly issued and the other type issued only under described circumstances or to particular described categories of owners and provision may be made for registration and release of security interests in registered public obligations.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol16">
       The system may include covenants of the issuer as to amendments, discontinuances, and reinstitutions of the system and the effect of such on the exemption of interest from the income tax provided for by the Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol17">
       Whenever an issuer issues an uncertificated registered public obligation, the system of registration may provide that a true copy of the official actions of the issuer relating to such uncertificated registered public obligation be maintained by the issuer or by the person, if any, maintaining such system on behalf of the issuer, so long as the uncertificated registered public obligation remains outstanding and unpaid. A copy of such official actions, verified to be such by an authorized officer, is admissible before any court of record, administrative body, or arbitration panel without further authentication.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol18">
       Nothing in this chapter precludes a conversion from one of the forms of registered public obligations provided for by this chapter to a form of obligations not provided for by this chapter if interest on the obligation so converted will continue to be exempt from the income tax provided for by the Code.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-03.1s21-03.1-02ol19">
       The rights provided by other laws with respect to obligations in forms not provided for by this chapter, to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter, apply with respect to registered public obligations issued in forms authorized by this chapter.
      </li>

      The issuer may amend, discontinue, and reinstitute any system, from time to time, subject to covenants.

In case there is no financial institution within any city, township, or school district, the governing board thereof, if it deems it more advantageous and for the best public interest and convenience, may select as a depository a conveniently located financial institution in an adjoining county, which thereupon shall qualify as a depository by giving such bond as is required from a financial institution within said county. Said bond must be approved by such governing board as to sufficiency and by the state’s attorney of the county in which such city, township, or school district is located as to form and must be deposited in the office of the county auditor of such county.

      Except as is otherwise provided in sections 21-04-16 and 21-04-17, and before any deposit is made in any depository other than the Bank of North Dakota, by or in behalf of any public corporation, such depository shall furnish a bond payable to the public corporation making such deposit in an amount that at least equals the largest deposit that at any time may be in such depository. Such bond must be approved as to form by the state’s attorney and as to amount and sufficiency by the board. If the board fails or refuses to approve any such bond, the same may be presented to the judge of the district court, upon three days’ notice to the clerk of the public corporation to which such bond was submitted, and the judge shall proceed forthwith to hear and determine the sufficiency of such bond and may approve or disapprove the same as the facts warrant. If the judge approves such bond, the said financial institution must be declared a depository of the funds of such public corporation. The sureties on all bonds required by public corporations according to the provisions of this chapter shall justify as required by chapter 32-02. In lieu of such personal bond, the governing board of the public corporation involved may require the financial institution designated as a depository to file a surety bond for a sum equal to the amount of funds such financial institution may receive according to the provisions of this chapter. Such bond, when approved, must be deposited with the county auditor. Such bond must be a continuing bond and must be binding until the proper board of the public corporation shall require a new or different bond, but in no case involving the deposit of funds of public corporations may such bond be continued without a renewal thereof for a longer period than four years.

    Pledge of security in place of depository bond.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The treasurer of a public corporation and every other individual legally charged with the custody of public funds may accept from any financial institution, as security for repayment of deposits, a pledge of securities in lieu of a personal or surety bond. When securities are pledged to the board of any public corporation, the treasurer or other individual legally charged with the custody of public funds shall require security in the amount of one hundred ten dollars for every one hundred dollars of public deposits. Securities that are eligible for the pledge are bills, notes, or bonds issued by the United States government, its agencies or instrumentalities, all bonds and notes guaranteed by the United States government, irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by federal home loan banks of a rating of AA or better by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard &amp; Poor’s Corporation, federal land bank bonds, bonds, notes, warrants, certificates of indebtedness, insured certificates of deposit, shares of investment companies registered under the Investment Companies Act of 1940, letters of credit issued by the Bank of North Dakota, and all other forms of securities issued by the state of North Dakota, its boards, agencies, or instrumentalities, or by any county, city, township, school district, park district, or other political subdivision of the state of North Dakota, whether payable from special revenues or supported by the full faith and credit of the issuing body, and bonds issued by any other state of the United States or other securities approved by the banking board. The securities and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as described in section 21-06-07 must be delivered to and held for safekeeping by any financial institution, other than the depository, which the depository and the public corporation may agree upon. Whenever any securities are deposited for safekeeping with a custodian, the custodian shall issue a joint receipt to the depository and the public corporation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any financial institution pledging securities, at any time it deems it advisable or desirable, and without the consent of the board of the public corporation, may substitute other eligible securities for all or any part of the securities pledged. The securities substituted must, at the time of the substitution, have a market value at least equal to the market value of the securities released and delivered to the depository.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event of the substitution the holder or custodian of the pledged securities shall, on the same day, forward by mail or electronic transmission to the public corporation and the depository financial institution a receipt specifically describing and identifying both the securities substituted and those released and returned to the depository financial institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      A depository financial institution may fulfill the pledge of securities requirements of this section by maintaining a security pledge schedule that establishes the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t21c21-04s21-04-09ol11">
       The names of all public bodies maintaining deposits with the financial institution.

       The net deposits exceeding federal deposit insurance corporation coverage for each account.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c21-04s21-04-09ol15">
       The amount of net deposit exceeding federal deposit insurance corporation deposit insurance multiplied by one hundred ten percent for each account.

       The amount of securities needed to be pledged to fulfill the requirements of this section.

       The total number of qualified securities pledged by the financial institution under the requirements of this section.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A financial institution is in compliance with this section as long as the security pledge schedule discloses the total qualified securities pledged in excess of the total pledges needed for a total amount of deposits maintained by all the public bodies with the financial institution as verified by the custodian of the securities every three months and copies are provided to the custodian of the securities and to each of the public corporations maintaining deposits with the financial institution.
     </p>
     <p>
      No pledge of security or bond may be required for any funds deposited with a financial institution directly or by a financial institution’s participation as a member of a deposit placement service to the extent that the deposits are insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or the national credit union administration as determined by the commissioner of financial institutions or an insurance company that is qualified to offer excess deposit insurance in this state and which has a rating of A- or better by A.M. Best Company Inc., or the equivalent rating by another recognized rating organization as determined by the insurance commissioner.

     <p>
      No account or claim against any township or county of this state may be allowed by the governing body thereof until a full itemized statement in writing has been filed with the governing body or unless otherwise authorized by the governing body pursuant to contract or other action. The governing body, in its discretion, may require the filing of any additional information which it may deem necessary to the proper understanding and audit of any claim or account and it may require the filing of a sworn statement in such form as it may prescribe. The provisions of this section, however, do not apply to any claim or demand for an annual salary or per diem of jurors or witnesses fixed by or in pursuance of any statute. Whenever the county auditor is not readily available to sign and issue warrants upon the county treasurer for the payment of the salary or per diem of jurors or witnesses, the county treasurer is authorized to pay such salary or per diem upon the written order of the judge of the court in which such jurors or witnesses have served and in such cases the county treasurer shall furnish the county auditor with statements of all claims paid.
