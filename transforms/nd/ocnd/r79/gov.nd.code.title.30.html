      Upon the death of a person in whom the title to real property constituting a homestead is vested, a homestead estate shall survive, and, until otherwise disposed of according to law, shall be set over to the persons and in the order following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t30c30-16s30-16-02ol11">
       To the surviving spouse for life or until the surviving spouse again marries.

      <li id="t30c30-16s30-16-02ol12">
       If there is no surviving spouse, to the decedent’s minor child or children, if any, until the youngest attains majority.

      <li id="t30c30-16s30-16-02ol13">
       If the surviving spouse dies before the youngest child attains majority, then after such death to the decedent’s minor child or children, if any, until the youngest attains majority. If a surviving minor child dies before the homestead estate has been terminated, such estate thereafter shall be dealt with as though such child had not lived.

        Upon the death of the head of a family, the homestead survives for the benefit of the surviving husband or wife and minor children. Sexton v. Sutherland, 37 N.D. 500, 164 N.W. 278, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1917).

      The real property subjected to the homestead estate descends, subject to the full satisfaction of that estate, exempt from decedent’s debts except claims in favor of the county for county general assistance, the department of health and human services for general assistance, and also for claims of the state of North Dakota for repayment of old-age assistance and aid to the permanently and totally disabled and as otherwise provided in section 47-18-04, and must be distributed in the manner in which real property not subjected to a homestead estate is distributed or as directed in the decedent’s will. The real property constituting the homestead of a decedent, or any part thereof, may not descend or be distributed to any person other than the surviving spouse and decedent’s heirs in the direct descending line as prescribed in title 30.1 until all the decedent’s debts are fully paid.

    Personal representative to value homestead.

     <p>
      The personal representative of an estate must procure from the person or persons to whom real property subjected to a homestead estate has descended a description of such property and must appraise the same at its value at the time of the death of the decedent. If necessary, the personal representative shall cause the boundaries thereof to be ascertained and marked in the personal representative’s presence by a competent surveyor. If the personal representative finds that it has been selected in such form as will materially diminish the value of any remaining part of the property, the personal representative may modify its boundaries so as to avoid such injury if it can be done without material injury to the homestead property. Should the personal representative find that the property selected as a homestead exceeds in value any limitation in value fixed by law, the personal representative in like manner shall set off the homestead in such form as to exclude the excess unless the personal representative further finds that the property cannot be divided without material injury. The personal representative shall make a full report of all the personal representative’s findings in relation to the homestead and annex the same to the inventory.

       <p>
        Homestead may be divided when the value of the homestead exceeds the homestead exemption amount of $100,000.00 and no material injury would result from the division; therefore, a district court did not abuse its discretion by dividing a marital homestead and awarding a surviving spouse a second floor residence as the homestead. However, the surviving spouse was improperly ordered to pay rent to live in the marital home; the decision to divide the marital home so as to ensure the value of the homestead granted to the surviving spouse remained within the homestead exemption amount was inconsistent with the purposes of the homestead provisions or case law.
