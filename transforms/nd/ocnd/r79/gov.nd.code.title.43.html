     <p>
      Before a certificate of authority may be issued, the applicant therefor shall file with the secretary-treasurer of the board a surety bond in favor of the state, or an abstracter’s liability policy to be approved by the board as to form, sufficiency, and surety thereof and written by a company authorized to write such insurance in this state, in a penal sum or limit of liability equal to ten thousand dollars for each ten thousand inhabitants, or major fraction thereof, residing in the county in which the applicant’s office is maintained, as shown by the last official federal or state census preceding the filing of the bond or abstracter’s liability policy. Such bond, or abstracter’s liability policy, however, may not be less than one hundred thousand dollars. The bond or liability policy must be conditioned for the payment by the abstracter of any liability imposed upon the abstracter by law for damages arising from any claim against the abstracter that may be sustained by or that accrues to any person by reason or on account of any negligent act, error, or omission in any abstract or certificate of title, or continuation thereof, made and issued by the abstracter. All surety bonds, liability policies, and evidence of annual renewal of the bonds and policies must be filed with the secretary-treasurer of the board. All abstracters’ liability policies must be endorsed to provide that cancellation cannot be effected by either the abstracter or the insurance company without ten days’ written notice to the abstracters’ board of examiners. It is permissible under this section to file an abstracter’s liability policy in the deductible form, provided that the deductible provision may not exceed ten thousand dollars.

      The board may inspect an abstracter’s records to determine compliance with this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter. The board may adopt rules under chapter 28-32 addressing discipline of abstracters, including establishing standards for timeliness of service based on a presumed standard turnaround time of three weeks or less. If the certificate of authority is held by a firm, corporation, or limited liability company, the provisions of this section shall be applicable to the members, officers, or managers thereof. Disciplinary measures that the board may take include canceling or suspending a certificate of authority or certificate of registration, requiring additional education, establishing a mentor or monitor, restricting practice parameters, or imposing a monetary penalty of no greater than five hundred dollars for each violation. In addition, an individual or organization found in violation of the requirements of this section may be assessed costs, including attorney’s fees, by the board. An entity whose certificate of authority has been canceled or suspended must surrender all customer abstracts and pending orders to the board immediately upon being notified of the cancellation or suspension. The board shall take reasonable measures to contact the customers.

The board may not charge an abstracter for the temporary certificate of authority. The board may require additional security than provided under section 43-01-11. The abstracter operating under the temporary certificate of authority is not required to have a complete tract index and all instruments of record in the office of the recorder in and for the county in which the abstracter is temporarily engaged in business, nor need the abstracter have been engaged in the preparation of such records. The temporary certificate of authority may not exceed such time as the board has determined an abstracter having a regular certificate of authority and certificate of registration is able to engage in and carry on the business of an abstracter of real estate titles in the county, but the abstracter holding the temporary certificate of authority may complete any work already engaged.

     <p>
      It is the policy of this state, and the purpose of this chapter, to promote the reliability of information that is used for guidance in financial transactions or for accounting for or assessing the financial status or performance of commercial, noncommercial, and governmental enterprises. Public interest requires that persons professing special competence in accountancy or offering assurance as to the reliability or fairness of presentation of such information have demonstrated or maintained their qualifications to do so, and that persons who have not demonstrated and maintained such qualifications, including certificate holders not in public practice, not be permitted to hold themselves out as having such special competence or to offer such assurance. Public interest requires that the conduct of persons licensed as having special competence in accountancy be regulated in all aspects of their professional work. Public interest requires that a public authority competent to prescribe and assess the qualifications and to regulate the conduct of practitioners of public accountancy and certificate holders not in public practice be established and that the use of titles which are likely to mislead the public as to the status or competence of the persons using such titles be prohibited.

The terms of office must be arranged so that only one term expires each year on June thirtieth. Successor board member appointments are for terms of five years.

A vacancy on the board must be filled by appointment by the governor from a list of at least three nominees submitted by the appropriate nominating committee. Any member of the board whose certificate is revoked or suspended automatically ceases to be a member of the board. The governor may remove any member of the board for neglect of duty or other just cause after a hearing. No person who has served two complete terms is eligible for reappointment, but appointment to fill an unexpired term may not be considered a complete term for this purpose.

    Investigations.

     <p>
      The practice and procedure of the board with respect to any investigation by the board authorized by this chapter must be in accordance with rules and regulations to be promulgated by the board, which must provide for at least twenty days’ notice in writing to all persons affected by orders to be made by the board after such investigation, and an opportunity to be heard either in person or by counsel and to introduce testimony in their behalf at a public hearing to be held for that purpose. Notice of any such investigation or hearing must be given to all persons to be directly affected thereby in the manner and form provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c43-04s43-04-41" target="_self">43-04-41</a></cite>. For the purposes of such investigation or any hearing which the board is authorized or required to conduct, the board or any members thereof, and its secretary, may conduct such hearing, administer oaths, take depositions, issue subpoenas, and compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, documents, and testimony. In case of failure of any person to comply with any order of the board or a subpoena issued by the board, or by any of its members, or its secretary, or on the refusal of a witness to testify to any matter regarding which the witness may be lawfully interrogated, the district judge of the county in which the person resides, on application of any member of the board, or its secretary, by order duly entered, may require the compliance of such person with any such order, and may enforce such compliance as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from such court, or of a refusal to testify therein. Each officer who serves a subpoena shall receive the same fees as a sheriff, and each witness who appears in obedience to a subpoena, before the board or a member, or its secretary, shall receive for attendance the fees and mileage provided for witnesses in civil cases in the courts of this state, which must be audited and paid in the same manner as other expenses are audited and paid, upon the presentation of proper vouchers approved by any two members of the board. No witnesses subpoenaed at the instance of a party other than the board, or one of its members, or its secretary shall be entitled to compensation unless the board certifies that this testimony was material to the matter investigated.

      Any applicant or licensee aggrieved by any action of the board taken under any of the provisions of this chapter, within thirty days after receipt of a copy of the order of the board, may file a petition in the district court, which has jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the order complained of. The board of barber examiners of North Dakota must be the defendant, and such petition must set forth the errors complained of. Unless they are waived, citations and other judicial process must be served upon the president of the board, or in the event of the president’s absence, upon any member of the board, or by leaving a copy at the office of the board or the office of the secretary-treasurer. Upon such service or waiver, the board, with its answer, shall file a transcript of the records of the board, and the original papers or transcripts thereof, and a certified transcript of all evidence adduced upon the hearing before the board in the proceedings complained of, which must be filed in the court. No proceedings to vacate, reverse, or modify a final order rendered by the board may operate to stay the execution or effect thereof unless the district court, or a judge thereof in vacation, on application and three days’ notice to the board, shall allow such stay, in which event the petitioner must be required to execute the petitioner’s bond in such a sum as the court may prescribe, with sufficient surety to the satisfaction of the court, conditioned for the prompt payment of all damages arising from or caused by the delay in the effectiveness or enforcement of the order complained of.

      A person may not advertise, hold out to the public, or represent in any manner that the person is authorized to practice barbering unless the person is authorized under this chapter to practice barbering or authorized to employ or lease space to a barber. A person not authorized to practice barbering or not authorized to employ or lease space to a barber may not place a barber pole in a location that would create or tend to create the impression to members of the general public that a business located near the barber pole is a barbershop unless the location of the barber pole is related to a business authorized to operate a barbershop. As used in this section, barber pole means a red, white, or blue striped vertical cylinder with a ball located on the top, bottom, or top and bottom of the cylinder, or any object or facsimile of similar nature, regardless of the actual shape or coloring, if the object or facsimile would tend to create an impression to members of the general public that a business located near the object is a barbershop.

The ex parte temporary suspension order is effective upon written notice to the podiatrist, specifying the law or rule violated. The ex parte temporary suspension remains in effect until the board issues a final order in the matter after a hearing unless otherwise ordered by a district court. When the board issues the ex parte temporary suspension notice, the board shall schedule a disciplinary hearing to be held pursuant to chapter 28-32. The hearing must be scheduled to begin no later than sixty days after the issuance of the ex parte temporary suspension. Within three days after the issuance of the ex parte suspension order, the board shall serve the podiatrist with a copy of the order along with a copy of the complaint and notice of the date set for the full hearing. The podiatrist may appeal the ex parte temporary suspension order prior to the full hearing. For purposes of this appeal, the district court shall decide whether probable cause reasonably requires the temporary suspension to adequately protect the public interests. The court shall give priority to the appeal for prompt disposition thereof. Unless ordered by the district court, an appeal by the podiatrist of the ex parte temporary suspension order does not stay the effectiveness or validity of the ex parte temporary suspension.

A podiatrist licensed or permitted under this chapter or an applicant for a license is considered to have consented to submit to a mental or physical examination or an addiction examination when directed in writing by the board and to have waived all objections to the admissibility of the examiner’s testimony or examination reports on the ground that the examination constitutes a privileged communication. The failure of a podiatrist or applicant for a license to submit to an examination when directed constitutes an admission of the allegations against the podiatrist or applicant for license and a default and final order may be entered without the taking of testimony or presentation of evidence unless the failure was due to circumstances beyond the podiatrist’s or applicant’s control. A podiatrist or applicant for a license must, at reasonable intervals, be given an opportunity to demonstrate that the podiatrist or applicant can resume or commence the competent practice of podiatric medicine with reasonable skill and safety to patients.

       If based on verified evidence the board determines by a clear and convincing standard that the evidence presented to the board indicates that the continued practice by the chiropractor would create significant risk of serious and ongoing harm to the public while a disciplinary proceeding is pending, and that immediate suspension of the chiropractor’s license is required to reasonably protect the public from the risk of harm, the board may order a temporary suspension ex parte. For purposes of this section, “verified evidence” means testimony taken under oath and based on personal knowledge. The board shall give prompt written notice of the suspension of the chiropractor, which must include a copy of the order and complaint, the date set for a full hearing, and, upon request, a specific description of the nature of the evidence, including a list of all known witnesses and a specific description of any documents relied upon by the board in ordering the temporary suspension must be made available to the chiropractor.

That hearing must be held not later than thirty days from the issuance of the ex parte temporary suspension order. The chiropractor is entitled to a continuance of the thirty-day period upon request for a period determined by the hearing officer.

       Considering that former subsection (3) (now subsection (1)) provides a clear and thorough definition of the term “contractor” consistent with the references to contractor activities contained in N.D.C.C. § 57-40.2-14, which is part of the use tax section of the code and discusses contractors involved in “the erection of buildings or the alteration, improvement or repair of real property,” the definition of “contractor” was held to apply to the term “contractor” used in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-40.2s57-40.2-03" target="_blank">57-40.2-03</a></cite>.3.

      <p>
       Taxpayer was not a contractor under the definition provided in former subsection (3) (now subsection (1)) of this section, where it assembled certain items of medical equipment in clinics, which were all put in place within a matter of days and could be equally easily removed, it was not registered as a contractor, and was not in the business of altering, repairing or improving real property; therefore, taxpayer was not liable for payment of contractor use tax under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-40.2s57-40.2-03" target="_blank">57-40.2-03</a></cite>.3.

        Supreme Court of North Dakota interprets
   N.D.C.C. § 43-07-02 to allow a contractor to pursue an action or claim only for work performed while licensed. This interpretation is consistent with the text and furthers the purpose of the licensing statutes. Snider v. Dickinson Elks Bldg., LLC, 2018 ND 55, 907 N.W.2d 397, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike statutes in other states,
   N.D.C.C. § 43-07-02 did not expressly condition court action on licensure both at the time of entering into a contract and at all times while performing work under a contract. Snider v.

      Within fifteen days from the date of application, the registrar may investigate and determine each applicant’s eligibility to act in the capacity of a contractor as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c43-07s43-07-04" target="_self">43-07-04</a></cite>.1, and no license may be issued to such applicant until the registrar receives all documentation necessary to obtain a license and the appropriate fee. The license issued on an original application entitles the licensee to act as a contractor within this state, subject to the limitations of such license, until the expiration of the then current contractor year ending March first, except that an initial license issued to a licensee in January or February is valid until March first of the subsequent year.

       Any license issued under this chapter may be renewed for each successive contractor year by obtaining from the registrar a certificate for the current contractor year. To obtain a certificate for the current contractor year, the licensee shall file with the registrar an application that includes a listing of each project, contract, or subcontract completed by the licensee during the preceding calendar year in this state over the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars and the nature of the work of each project, contract, or subcontract. The registrar, within a reasonable time, shall forward a copy of the list to the state tax commissioner. The applicant shall include with the application a copy of a certificate of liability insurance naming the registrar as the certificate holder unless the registrar has a current valid certificate of insurance on file, and a certification that the applicant has submitted all payroll taxes, including North Dakota income tax, workforce safety and insurance premiums, and unemployment insurance premiums due at the time of renewal, which documents need not be notarized.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-07s43-07-10ol12">
       The registrar may refuse to renew a license if the registrar determines the application contains false, misleading, or incomplete information or if the contractor’s license is not in good standing for any of the reasons listed in subsection 3 of section 43-07-04. The registrar shall notify the applicant in writing if the registrar does not grant the license and shall provide the applicant an opportunity to respond to or cure the defect in the application for a period of ten days from the date of the written notification. An applicant aggrieved by a decision of the registrar not to grant the license may appeal the decision to the district court of the applicant’s county of residence or Burleigh County.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-07s43-07-10ol13">
       The application for a certificate for the current contractor year must be made to the registrar before March second of each year, except as provided otherwise under this chapter. At the time of filing the application for a certificate for the current contractor year, the applicant shall pay to the registrar the renewal fee established in section 43-07-07. If any contractor applies for a renewal under a class different from the license previously issued, the new class license may be issued upon the payment of the fee required for the issuance of the license of the class applied for. If any contractor fails to file an application for a certificate for the current contractor year by the March first deadline, the contractor’s license is not in good standing and the contractor is deemed to be unlicensed within the meaning of section 43-07-02. Within sixty days after March first, the registrar shall notify the contractor by mail that the contractor’s license is not in good standing. The contractor then has until June first to renew by paying a penalty fee of fifty dollars, filing an application for a certificate for the current contractor year, and paying the renewal fee. A contractor who applies for a certificate for the current contractor year before or within ninety days of the filing deadline is not subject to the investigation authorized in section 43-07-09. After the June first deadline any licenses not renewed are expired. Any application for a certificate for the current contractor year must be fully completed within sixty days of the date the application is received by the registrar or the registrar shall return the application to the contractor who then is subject to section 43-07-09. The registrar may destroy all renewals provided for in this section after the renewals have been on file for six years.

     <p>
      The registrar shall review each complaint filed under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c43-07s43-07-14" target="_self">43-07-14</a></cite>. If the registrar determines a written complaint filed under section 43-07-14 provides sufficient facts upon which a reasonable person could conclude that one or more of the acts or omissions set forth in section 43-07-14 has been committed, the registrar may initiate an adjudicative proceeding in accordance with chapter 28-32. If, after an adjudicative proceeding or as part of an informal disposition under chapter 28-32, the registrar determines the licensee is guilty of an act or omission charged or if the licensee admits guilt to an act or omission charged, the registrar may suspend or revoke the contractor’s license, order a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars, order restitution in an amount not more than five thousand dollars, or impose some lesser sanction or remedy. The registrar may suspend the contractor’s license for a period of not more than sixty months. The registrar may not renew, reinstate, or issue a new license until the licensee has paid any civil penalty or restitution imposed under this section. The registrar may bring an action in district court to recover restitution or penalties under this section. A contractor aggrieved by a decision of the registrar in revoking or suspending the contractor’s license or ordering restitution or penalties may appeal the decision to the district court of that person’s county of residence or Burleigh County. Any licensee may not obtain a license under any name during the period of revocation or suspension. A “licensee” whose license is revoked or suspended includes any officer, director, agent, member, or employee of the licensee. The provisions of chapter 28-32 govern any appeal and proceedings under this section.

    Nonresident contractors — Agent for service of process.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every applicant for a contractor’s license who is not a resident of the state of North Dakota, by signing and filing the application, appoints the registrar as the applicant’s true and lawful agent upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action or proceeding against such nonresident contractor. The appointment in writing is evidence of the contractor’s consent that any process against the contractor which is so served upon the registrar is of the same legal force and effect as if served upon the contractor personally within this state. Registered foreign corporations entitled to do business in this state according to chapter 10-19.1, registered foreign limited liability companies entitled to do business in the state according to chapter 10-32.1, foreign limited liability partnerships entitled to do business in the state according to chapter 45-22, and foreign limited partnerships entitled to do business in the state according to chapter 45-10.2 and having a current registered agent and registered address on file in the registrar’s office do not need to appoint the registrar as agent for service of process under this section. Within ten days after service of the summons upon the registrar, notice of the service with the summons and complaint in the action must be sent to the defendant contractor at the defendant contractor’s last-known address by registered mail with return receipt requested and proof of the mailing must be attached to the summons. The registrar shall keep a record of all process served upon the registrar under this section, showing the day and hour of service. If service of process was made under this section, the court, before entering a default judgment, or at any stage of the proceeding, may order the continuance as may be necessary to afford the defendant contractor reasonable opportunity to defend any action pending against the defendant contractor.

The court may not require a written undertaking, security, or bond as a basis for issuing any temporary or permanent restraining order under this section unless the court specifically orders and states the basis for requiring the security. Upon a determination that a violation of section 43-09-09 or 43-09-09.2 has occurred, the court may assess against the defendants the actual costs incurred and reasonable attorney’s fees necessary for the investigation and court proceedings against the unlicensed person.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person may not operate or manage a funeral establishment without a funeral establishment license issued by the board for each place of business. Except for on tribal land, a funeral establishment may not be located on tax-exempt property. A person desiring to operate a funeral establishment shall submit an application for an annual license for each funeral establishment to the secretary or executive secretary of the board accompanied by a license fee for each establishment of not more than one hundred dollars, as established by the board. A person operating or managing a funeral establishment shall annually, on or before December first, submit an application for renewal of a license with a renewal fee of not more than one hundred twenty-five dollars, as established by the board. A license is valid until the following January first, unless sooner revoked. An application must show that the funeral establishment has complied with all rules adopted by the board in regard to safety and sanitation and will be under the supervision of an individual licensed to practice funeral service. An applicant who has met these standards must be issued a license. In case of the death of an owner of a funeral establishment who leaves an established business as part or all of an estate, the board may issue a special renewable temporary license to the personal representative of the deceased person for the duration of the administration of the estate, but which may not exceed two years. The fee for the temporary license is the same as required for regular licenses.

       If payments are made to a person upon pre-need funeral service contracts, including irrevocable itemized funeral contracts, one hundred percent of the funds collected under the contracts for the sale of professional service or personal property to be used in funeral services and fifty percent of the funds collected under the contracts for the sale of cemetery merchandise must be deposited in or transferred to a trust company in this state or to a federally insured bank, credit union, or savings and loan association in this state, within ten days. The deposit must be placed in a federal deposit insurance corporation or national credit union administration insured account or certificate of deposit or negotiable debt obligation of the United States government. Payments received from the sale of professional service or personal property to be used in funeral services or cemetery merchandise which cannot or would not be serviced by a licensed funeral establishment or cemetery association in the area in which the service or property was sold are specifically included, regardless of whether the sales might otherwise be considered pre-need funeral service contracts, within the payments to be deposited under this section. If payments have been made under an irrevocable itemized funeral contract, the money must be carried in a separate account or separate certificate of deposit with the names of the depositor or transferor, cemetery association or licensed funeral establishment, and the person making payment on behalf of the individual for whose benefit payment is made.

The funds may be released or transferred by the bank, credit union, savings and loan association, or trust company to the person making the payment, before the death of the individual for whose benefit the funds are paid, upon a five-day written notice by registered or certified mail made by the bank, credit union, savings and loan association, or trust company to the depositor or transferor at the request of the person making the payment.

         A purchaser of a pre-need funeral service contract may make a certain amount of the pre-need funds irrevocable by designating an irrevocable amount to be used to pay for the funeral of the beneficiary. The irrevocable itemized funeral service contract to pay for a funeral is recognized as an allowable asset exclusion used for determining eligibility for medical assistance under section 50-24.1-02.3 at the time the contract is entered. A purchaser of an irrevocable itemized funeral contract has forty-five days from entering the contract to cancel the irrevocable part of the contract by giving notice to the cemetery association or licensed funeral establishment with which the contract was entered. Any pre-need funeral service contract held by a cemetery association or a licensed funeral establishment must be fully transferable to another cemetery association or funeral establishment licensed under chapter 43-10 or a substantially similar law of another jurisdiction which agrees to accept the obligations.

        The board has the authority pursuant to this section to direct that only associate and baccalaureate degree graduates may sit for practical and registered nursing license examinations, respectively. This appears to be a reasonable requirement in an area of standard setting. Trinity Medical Ctr. v. North Dakota Bd. of Nursing, 399 N.W.2d 835, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        The board has the authority pursuant to this section to define “school” as “a post secondary educational institution offering transferable academic credit” excluding diploma nursing schools from operating nursing programs unless they offer transferable academic credits. That this marks a tightening of the rules as they relate to the licensing of nurses does not make the rule violative of the state or United States Constitutions. Trinity Medical Ctr. v. North Dakota Bd. of Nursing, 399 N.W.2d 835, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1987).

All costs associated with obtaining a background check are the responsibility of the applicant, licensee, or registrant. The board may grant a nonrenewable temporary permit to an applicant for initial or renewed license or registration who submits to a criminal history record check as required by this chapter if the applicant has met all other licensure or registration requirements in accordance with subsection 2 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c43-12.1s43-12.1-09" target="_self">43-12.1-09</a></cite>.

     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      “Advanced practice registered nurse” means a registered nurse who has gained additional specialized knowledge, skills, and experience through a program of study recognized or defined by the Interstate Commission of Advanced Practice Registered Nurse Compact Administrators (“commission”), and who is licensed to perform advanced nursing practice. An advanced practice registered nurse is licensed in an advanced practice registered nurse role that is congruent with an advanced practice registered nurse educational program, certification, and commission rules.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      “Advanced practice registered nurse licensure” means the regulatory mechanism used by a party state to grant legal authority to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE III — GENERAL PROVISIONS AND JURISDICTION
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      A state must implement procedures for considering the criminal history records of applicants for initial advanced practice registered nurse licensure or advanced practice registered nurse licensure by endorsement. Such procedures must include the submission of fingerprints or other biometric-based information by advanced practice registered nurse applicants for the purpose of obtaining an applicant’s criminal history record information from the federal bureau of investigation and the agency responsible for retaining that state’s criminal records.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      Each party state shall require an applicant to satisfy the following advanced practice registered nurse uniform licensure requirements to obtain or retain a multistate license in the home state:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       a.
      </b>
      Meets the home state’s qualifications for licensure or renewal of licensure, as well as, all other applicable state laws;
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       b. (1)
      </b>
      Has completed an accredited graduate-level education program that prepares the applicant for one of the four recognized roles and population foci; or
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       (2)
      </b>
      Has completed a foreign advanced practice registered nurse education program for one of the four recognized roles and population foci that:
     </p>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t43c43-12.5s43-12.5-01ol2a">

      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-12.5s43-12.5-01ol2b">
       Has been verified by an independent credentials review agency to be comparable to a licensing board-approved advanced practice registered nurse education program;
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      An advanced practice registered nurse issued a multistate license must be licensed in an approved role and at least one approved population focus.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       4.
      </b>
      An advanced practice registered nurse multistate license issued by a home state to a resident in that state will be recognized by each party state as authorizing the advanced practice registered nurse to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse in each party state, under a multistate licensure privilege, in the same role and population focus as the advanced practice registered nurse is licensed in the home state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       5.
      </b>
      Nothing in this compact shall affect the requirements established by a party state for the issuance of a single-state license, except that an individual may apply for a single-state license, instead of a multistate license, even if otherwise qualified for the multistate license. However, the failure of such an individual to affirmatively opt for a single-state license may result in the issuance of a multistate license.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       6.
      </b>
      Issuance of an advanced practice registered nurse multistate license must include prescriptive authority for noncontrolled prescription drugs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       7.
      </b>
      For each state in which an advanced practice registered nurse seeks authority to prescribe controlled substances, the advanced practice registered nurse shall satisfy all requirements imposed by such state in granting and renewing such authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       8.
      </b>
      An advanced practice registered nurse issued a multistate license may assume responsibility and accountability for patient care independent of any supervisory or collaborative relationship. This authority may be exercised in the home state and in any remote state in which the advanced practice registered nurse exercises a multistate licensure privilege.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       9.
      </b>
      All party states are authorized, in accordance with state due process laws, to take adverse action against an advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate licensure privilege such as revocation, suspension, probation, or any other action that affects an advanced practice registered nurse’s authorization to practice under a multistate licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a party state takes such action, it promptly shall notify the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system promptly shall notify the home state of any such actions by remote states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       10.
      </b>
      Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, an advanced practice registered nurse practicing in a party state shall comply with the state practice laws of the state in which the client is located at the time service is provided. Advanced practice registered nurse practice is not limited to patient care, but includes all advanced nursing practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party state in which the client is located. Advanced practice registered nurse practice in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege subjects the advanced practice registered nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, the courts, and the laws of the party state in which the client is located at the time service is provided.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       11.
      </b>
      Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, this compact does not affect additional requirements imposed by states for advanced practice registered nursing. However, a multistate licensure privilege to practice registered nursing granted by a party state must be recognized by other party states as satisfying any state law requirement for registered nurse licensure as a precondition for authorization to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse in that state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       12.
      </b>
      Individuals not residing in a party state shall continue to be able to apply for a party state’s single-state advanced practice registered nurse license as provided under the laws of each party state. However, the single-state license granted to these individuals will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice as an advanced practice registered nurse in any other party state.

       ARTICLE IV — APPLICATIONS FOR ADVANCED PRACTICE REGISTERED NURSE LICENSURE IN A PARTY STATE
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      Upon application for an advanced practice registered nurse multistate license, the licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, through the coordinated licensure information system, whether the applicant has ever held or is the holder of a licensed practical/vocational nursing license, a registered nursing license, or an advanced practice registered nurse license issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the applicant, and whether the applicant is currently participating in an alternative program.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      An advanced practice registered nurse may hold a multistate advanced practice registered nurse license, issued by the home state, in only one party state at a time.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      If an advanced practice registered nurse changes primary state of residence by moving between two party states, the advanced practice registered nurse shall apply for advanced practice registered nurse licensure in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the prior home state must be deactivated in accordance with applicable commission rules.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       a.
      </b>
      The advanced practice registered nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a change in primary state of residence.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       b.
      </b>
      A multistate advanced practice registered nurse license may not be issued by the new home state until the advanced practice registered nurse provides satisfactory evidence of a change in primary state of residence to the new home state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain a multistate advanced practice registered nurse license from the new home state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       4.
      </b>
      If an advanced practice registered nurse changes primary state of residence by moving from a party state to a nonparty state, the advanced practice registered nurse multistate license issued by the prior home state converts to a single-state license, valid only in the former home state.

       a.
      </b>

      <b>
       b.
      </b>

      <b>
       c.
      </b>
      Complete any pending investigations of an advanced practice registered nurse who changes primary state of residence during the course of such investigations. The licensing board also may take any appropriate action and promptly shall report the conclusions of such investigations to the administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure information system promptly shall notify the new home state of any such actions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       d.
      </b>
      Issue subpoenas for both hearings and investigations which require the attendance and testimony of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. Subpoenas issued by a party state licensing board for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence from another party state must be enforced in the latter state by any court of competent jurisdiction, according to that court’s practice and procedure in considering subpoenas issued in its own proceedings. The issuing licensing board shall pay any witness fees, travel expenses, mileage, and other fees required by the service statutes of the state in which the witnesses and evidence are located.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       e.

     <p>
      <b>
       f.
      </b>
      If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from the affected advanced practice registered nurse the costs of investigations and disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action taken against that advanced practice registered nurse.

     <p>
      <b>
       g.
      </b>
      Take adverse action based on the factual findings of another party state, if the licensing board follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      If adverse action is taken by a home state against an advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate licensure, the privilege to practice in all other party states under a multistate licensure privilege must be deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that impose adverse action against an advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate license must include a statement that the advanced practice registered nurse’s multistate licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during the pendency of the order.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      This compact does not override a party state’s decision that participation in an alternative program may be used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the multistate license of any advanced practice registered nurse for the duration of the advanced practice registered nurse’s participation in an alternative program.

    Impaired optometrists.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      After a hearing conducted pursuant to chapter 28-32, the board may restrict, suspend, or revoke the license of any licensed optometrist whose mental or physical ability to practice optometry with reasonable skill and safety is impaired.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t43c43-13s43-13-26.5ol11">
       For the purpose of this section, “impairment” means the inability of a licensee to practice optometry with reasonable skill and safety by reason of:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43c43-13s43-13-26.5ol11a">
         Mental illness; or
        </li>
        <li id="t43c43-13s43-13-26.5ol11b">
         Physical illness, including physical deterioration that adversely affects cognitive, motor, or perceptive skills.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-13s43-13-26.5ol12">
       The board may, upon probable cause, require a licensee or applicant to submit to a mental or physical examination by appropriate health care providers designated by the board. The results of the examination are admissible in any hearing, despite any claim of privilege under any contrary rule or statute. Every person who receives a license to practice optometry or who files an application for a license to practice optometry is deemed to have given consent to submit to the admissibility of the results in any hearing. If a licensee or applicant fails to submit to an examination when properly directed to do so by the board, unless the failure was due to circumstances deemed to be beyond the licensee’s control, the board may enter a final disciplinary order upon proper notice, hearing, and proof of such refusal.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-13s43-13-26.5ol13">
       If the board finds, after examination and administrative hearing, that a licensee is impaired, it may take one or more of the following actions:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43c43-13s43-13-26.5ol13a">
         Direct the licensee to submit to care, counseling, or treatment acceptable to the board; and
        </li>
        <li id="t43c43-13s43-13-26.5ol13b">
         Suspend, limit, or restrict the optometrist’s license for the duration of the impairment.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-13s43-13-26.5ol14">
       Any licensee or applicant who is prohibited from practicing optometry under this section must be afforded an opportunity, at reasonable intervals, to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that the licensee or applicant can resume or begin the practice of optometry with reasonable skill and safety. Licensure may not be reinstated without the payment of the current license fee and may be subject to such reasonable restrictions as may be imposed by the board.

      It is unlawful for any person who is not the holder of a license to practice optometry, to engage in the practice of optometry, directly or indirectly, by employing or hiring upon a salary, commission, or other profit-sharing arrangement a licensed optometrist except as permitted by the rules and regulations of the board.

If the judge determines that the drug or device so detained or embargoed is not adulterated, misbranded, mislabeled, or improperly identified, the board shall direct the immediate removal of the tag or other marking. If the court finds the detained or embargoed drug or device is adulterated, misbranded, mislabeled, or improperly identified, such drug or device, after entry of the decree, shall be destroyed at the expense of the owner under the supervision of a board representative and all court costs and fees, storage, and other proper expense shall be borne by the owner of such drug or device. When the adulteration, misbranding, mislabeling, or improper identification can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the drug or device, the court, after entry of the decree and after such costs, fees, and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond has been posted, may direct that such drug or device be delivered to the owner for labeling or processing under the supervision of a board representative. Expense of supervision shall be paid by the owner. Bond posted shall be returned to the owner of the drug or device on representation to the court by the board that the drug or device is no longer in violation of the embargo and the expense of supervision has been paid. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the board to report violations whenever the board believes the public’s interest will be adequately served in the circumstances by a suitable written notice or warning.

        The board has no right to make a rule including any substantive matter not authorized by statute. Any such new matter would constitute legislation. Medical Properties v. North Dakota Bd. of Pharmacy, 80 N.W.2d 87, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 1956).
       </p>

        Denial of post-conviction relief was proper, because an administrative rule delineated JWH-018 1-Pentyl-3 (1-naphthoyl) indole (JWH-018) as a prohibited controlled substance when petitioner committed the alleged acts, the administrative rule had force and effect of law upon becoming effective, and subsequent codification of JWH-018 as a prohibited controlled substance did not invalidate the effect of the final administrative rule.

If the judge determines that the drug or device so detained or embargoed is not adulterated, misbranded, mislabeled, or improperly identified, the board shall direct the immediate removal of the tag or other marking. If the court finds the detained or embargoed drug or device is adulterated, misbranded, mislabeled, or improperly identified, such drug or device, after entry of the decree, shall be destroyed at the expense of the owner under the supervision of a board representative and all court costs and fees, storage, and other proper expense shall be borne by the owner of such drug or device. When the adulteration, misbranding, mislabeling, or improper identification can be corrected by proper labeling or processing of the drug or device, the court, after entry of the decree and after such costs, fees, and expenses have been paid and a good and sufficient bond has been posted, may direct that such drug or device be delivered to the owner for labeling or processing under the supervision of a board representative. Expense of supervision shall be paid by the owner. Bond posted shall be returned to the owner of the drug or device on representation to the court by the board that the drug or device is no longer in violation of the embargo and the expense of supervision has been paid. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the board to report violations whenever the board believes the public’s interest will be adequately served in the circumstances by a suitable written notice or warning.

      Any applicant who is a graduate of a school or college of pharmacy located outside the United States, whose school or college of pharmacy has not been recognized by the board as an approved school but who is otherwise qualified to apply for licensure to practice pharmacy in this state, may be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of subsection 3 by verification to the board of applicant’s academic record and applicant’s graduation and by meeting such other requirements as the board may establish from time to time. The board may require such applicant to successfully pass an examination or examinations given or approved by the board to establish proficiency in English and equivalency of education of such applicant with qualified graduates of a school or college recognized by the board as a prerequisite of taking the licensure examination provided for in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c43-15s43-15-19" target="_self">43-15-19</a></cite>.

      Before a license will be granted by the North Dakota board of pharmacy, the applicant must have practical experience for a term to be determined by the board in accordance with the requirements of the national association of boards of pharmacy in a retail pharmacy under the supervision of a licensed pharmacist, which experience must be predominantly work directly relating to selling drugs and poisons, compounding of pharmaceutical preparations and physicians’ prescriptions, keeping records, and making reports required under the state and federal statutes. Any employment of the applicant prior to the applicant’s completion of the first year of study in a college of pharmacy or its equivalent may not be applied in computing the fulfillment of this requirement.

      If a licensed pharmacist in this state fails to pay the fee for a renewal of a license within the time required, the secretary of the board shall mail the pharmacist a notice, addressed to the pharmacist’s last-known place of residence, notifying the pharmacist of failure to obtain a renewal license. The delinquent licenseholder, within sixty days after the notice is mailed, may procure a renewal license upon the payment of a renewal fee to be set by the board not to exceed one hundred dollars. If the licenseholder fails to have a license renewed within sixty days after the notice is mailed, the original or renewal license, as the case may be, becomes void and the registry thereof must be canceled. The board, on application of the delinquent licenseholder and upon the payment of all unpaid fees, may authorize the issuance of a new license without examination, if it is satisfied that the applicant is a proper individual to receive the same.

A pharmacist, pharmacy technician, or institution from which the pharmacist or pharmacy technician voluntarily resigns, or voluntarily limits that individual’s staff privileges, shall report the actions of the licensee or registrant to the state board of pharmacy if that action occurs while the licensee or registrant is under formal or informal investigation by the institution or a committee of the institution for any reason related to possible professional incompetence, unprofessional conduct, or mental or physical impairment. Upon receiving a report concerning a licensee or registrant, the board’s investigative committee may investigate any evidence that appears to show a licensee or registrant is committing, or may have committed, any of the grounds for disciplinary action provided by law or rules adopted by the board. A person required to report under this section who makes a report in good faith is not subject to criminal prosecution or civil liability for making the report. For purposes of any civil proceeding, the good faith of a person who makes the report under this section is presumed. A report to the impaired pharmacist program, the pharm-assist committee, of the North Dakota pharmacists association is considered reporting under this section. For purposes of this section, a person has actual knowledge if that person acquired the information by personal observation or under circumstances that cause that person to believe there exists a substantial likelihood that the information is correct. An agency or health care institution that violates this section is guilty of a class B misdemeanor. A pharmacist, pharmacy permitholder, pharmacy intern, or pharmacy technician who violates this section is guilty of a class B misdemeanor and is subject to administrative action by the state board of pharmacy as specified by law or by rule.

      If the board determines that a wholesale drug distributor or wholesale pharmacy distributor has committed an act or is engaging in a course of conduct which constitutes a clear and present danger to the public health and safety in this state, the board may restrict or suspend the wholesale drug distributor’s or pharmacy distributor’s license. The board has the burden of proving that a wholesale drug distributor or wholesale pharmacy distributor is a clear and present danger to the public health and safety.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board or a designee of the board may conduct inspections during normal business hours upon all open premises purporting or appearing to be used by a wholesale drug distributor or wholesale pharmacy distributor in this state. A distributor who provides adequate documentation of the most recent satisfactory inspection less than three years old by either the United States food and drug administration or a state agency determined to be comparable by the board is exempt from further inspection for a period of time determined by the board. This exemption does not bar the board from initiating an investigation pursuant to a complaint regarding a wholesale drug distributor or pharmacy distributor. A wholesale drug distributor may keep records at a central location apart from the principal office of the wholesale drug distributor or the location at which the drugs were stored and from which they were shipped; provided, that the records are made available for inspection within three business days of a request by the board. The records may be kept in any form permissible under federal law applicable to prescription drugs recordkeeping. A person who fails to provide a duly authorized person the right of entry as provided in this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor for the first conviction and a class C felony for each subsequent conviction.

       A wholesale distributor that engages in the wholesale distribution of prescription drugs, medical gases, or medical equipment shall pay the annual fee required by the board, must be licensed by the board under this chapter, and must be properly licensed in any other state in which the wholesale distributor engages in the distribution of prescription drugs, medical gases, or medical equipment before engaging in wholesale distributions of wholesale prescription drugs, medical gases, or medical equipment in this state. The licensee shall operate in a manner prescribed by law and according to rules adopted by the board. However, information and qualification requirements for licensure beyond that required by federal law or regulation do not apply to manufacturers distributing the manufacturers’ own United States food and drug administration-approved drugs, gases, or equipment, unless particular requirements are deemed necessary and appropriate following rulemaking. The board may grant a temporary license when the wholesale distributor or pharmacy distributor first applies for a license to operate within this state. A temporary license is valid until the board finds that the applicant meets the requirements for regular licensure.

The issuance of a license under this section does not affect tax liability imposed by the tax department on any out-of-state wholesale distributor or pharmacy distributor. The board may adopt rules that permit out-of-state wholesale distributors to obtain a license on the basis of reciprocity if an out-of-state wholesale distributor possesses a valid license granted by another state and the legal standards for licensure in the other state are comparable to the standards under this chapter and the other state extends reciprocity to wholesale drug distributors licensed in this state.

A distributor that provides adequate documentation of the most recent satisfactory inspection less than three years old by the United States food and drug administration is exempt from further inspection for a period of time determined by the board. This exemption does not bar the board from initiating an investigation pursuant to a complaint regarding a wholesale distributor or pharmacy distributor. A wholesale distributor or pharmacy distributor may keep records at a central location apart from the principal office of the wholesale distributor or pharmacy distributor or the location at which the drugs are stored and from which they were shipped, provided that the records are made available for inspection within three business days of a request by the board.

        The term “practicing medicine” is not concerned with the efficacy of the remedy. When one diagnoses disease and prescribes and applies any therapeutic agent as a remedy, he is, in a broad sense, practicing medicine. State v. Miller, 59 N.D. 286, 229 N.W. 569, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1930).

        Lessor did not breach a lease by refusing to renew it for a 5-year term because a lessee failed to maintain his medical license, which was a “necessary license” under the unambiguous terms of the lease; under N.D.C.C. § 9-07-03, the parties intended for the lessee to provide medical care from an office leased from inside of a nursing home, which was partially indicated by the fact that the suffix “M.D.” was placed after the lessee’s name in the lease document.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A statute making it an offense to practice medicine without a license is aimed at one holding himself out to be a “physician”, “doctor” or “surgeon”. State v. Miller, 59 N.D. 286, 229 N.W. 569, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1930).

         Religion As Defense.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Issue in prosecution for practicing medicine without a license was whether defendant prescribed or administered medicines or assumed title of physician and was consulted and practiced as such; issue was not nature or effect of substances given as medicine or name assigned by defendant to his practices; assertions that defendant was practicing naturopathy, that naturopathy was a tenet of his church and that defendant was acting as an ordained minister were irrelevant.

        Due Process.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Doctor’s right to due process was not violated during medical board disciplinary proceedings where one of the investigators for the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners had an alleged personal and financial conflict of interest in the case, because the statutory scheme for the Board and its investigative panels precluded Board members, like the investigator who served on an investigative panel, from participating in adjudicatory proceedings before the Board on that complaint. The statutory scheme for the Board’s investigative panels, coupled with the other statutory procedures for adjudication by the Board, provided adequate procedural safeguards to satisfy the requirements for due process, and the investigator’s participation in the investigation of the complaints did not violate due process and, therefore, the district court did not err in deciding the Board did not violate the doctor’s due process or equal protection rights.

       Under subsection (3), as it read prior to the 1997 amendment, an applicant was required to demonstrate the kinds of courses taken at a foreign institution, when combined with the successful completion of three years of board-approved postgraduate training, were substantially equivalent to the kinds of courses required at a reputable medical or osteopathic college in the United States and the successful completion of one year of Board-approved postgraduate training.

      </p>
      <p>
       The Board’s finding that applicant’s educational requirements were not substantially equivalent to the educational qualifications of a physician educated in the U.S. was supported by a preponderance of the evidence where expert testimony was presented regarding the vast differences between a British osteopathic education and that of one in the U.S.; furthermore, the Board did not require the differing educations to be mirror images when it rejected the student’s clinical externships and self-study for not being substantially similar to courses required at a reputable osteopathic college in the U.S. Singha v.

        There was evidence supporting the determination of the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners that the doctor engaged in a continued pattern of inappropriate care of several patients in violation of N.D.C.C. § 43-17-31(21), and failed to appropriately document medical records for those patients, which reflected a serious departure from the appropriate standard of care; also, there was evidence that supported a determination that the doctor’s prior behavior, his attitude, and the probable logistics for supervision rendered the administrative law judge’s recommendation for monitoring unworkable. Furthermore, the Board was authorized by law to revoke the doctor’s license; thus, the district court erred in reversing the Board’s order revoking the doctor’s license.

        Where Administrative Law Judge made factual findings that physician falsely answered “NO” to license renewal application question asking if physician had any serious physical or mental illness and whether physician had received treatment for any mental illness since his last application for license renewal, Board of Medical Examiners’ conclusion of law that physician had violated subsection (1) was supported by the findings of fact.

      In any order or decision issued by the board in resolution of a disciplinary proceeding in which disciplinary action is imposed against a physician or physician assistant, the board may direct any physician or physician assistant to pay the board a sum not to exceed the reasonable and actual costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred by the board and investigative panels of the board in the investigation and prosecution of the case. If applicable, the physician’s or physician assistant’s license may be suspended until the costs are paid to the board. A physician or physician assistant may challenge the reasonableness of any cost item in a hearing under chapter 28-32 before an administrative law judge. The administrative law judge may approve, deny, or modify any cost item, and the determination of the judge is final. The hearing must occur before the physician’s license or physician assistant’s license may be suspended for nonpayment.

       When, based on verified evidence, the board determines by a clear and convincing standard that the evidence presented to the board indicates that the continued practice by the physician would create a significant risk of serious and ongoing harm to the public while a disciplinary proceeding is pending, and that immediate suspension of the physician’s license is required to reasonably protect the public from that risk of harm, the board may order a temporary suspension ex parte. For purposes of this section, “verified evidence” means testimony taken under oath and based on personal knowledge. The board shall give prompt written notice of the suspension to the physician, which must include a copy of the order and complaint, the date set for a full hearing, and a specific description of the nature of the evidence, including a list of all known witnesses and a description of any documents relied upon by the board in ordering the temporary suspension which, upon request, must be made available to the physician.

        Doctor requested a continuance to personally appear before the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners at its March 19, 2004, meeting, but, at that meeting, the Board instituted proceedings on the March 19, 2004, complaint, which incorporated the seven allegations of inappropriate care and inappropriate documentation from the 2003 complaint, plus three additional claims of inappropriate care, and then delayed disposition on the administrative law judge’s recommended sanction for the 2003 complaint; the delay in the adoption of an order in the 2003 case was effectively superseded by the 2004 action and the Board’s temporary suspension of the doctor’s license continued until completion of the 2004 case. The statutes did not preclude the Board from temporarily suspending the doctor’s license and initiating a new proceeding that incorporated the allegations from the 2003 complaint; thus, the Board’s action in delaying disposition on the 2003 complaint did not preclude the Board from considering the cumulative effect of the conduct from that complaint in the proceedings on the 2004 complaint, including the determination of an appropriate sanction.

      No physician, surgeon, hospital, blood bank, tissue bank, or other person or entity who donates, obtains, prepares, transplants, injects, transfuses, or otherwise transfers, or who assists or participates in obtaining, preparing, transplanting, injecting, transfusing, or transferring any tissue, organ, blood, or component thereof from one or more human beings, living or dead, to another human being, may be liable as the result of any such activity, save and except that each such person or entity remains liable for the person’s or entity’s own negligence or willful misconduct only.
     </p>
     <p>
      The availability of scientific knowledge, skills, and materials for the transplantation, injection, transfusion, or transfer of human tissue, organs, blood, and components thereof is important to the health and welfare of the people of this state. The imposition of legal liability without fault upon the persons and organizations engaged in such scientific procedures inhibits the exercise of sound medical judgment and restricts the availability of important scientific knowledge, skills, and materials. It is therefore the public policy of this state to promote the health and welfare of the people by limiting the legal liability arising out of such scientific procedures to instances of negligence or willful misconduct.

    Standard of care and professional ethics.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A licensee is held to the same standard of care and same ethical standards, whether practicing traditional in-person medicine or telemedicine. The following apply in the context of telemedicine:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t43c43-17s43-17-44ol11">
       Professional ethical standards require a practitioner to practice only in areas in which the practitioner has demonstrated competence, based on the practitioner’s training, ability, and experience. In assessing a licensee’s compliance with this ethical requirement, the board shall give consideration to board certifications and specialty groups’ telemedicine standards.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-17s43-17-44ol12">
       A licensee practicing telemedicine shall establish a bona fide relationship with the patient before the diagnosis or treatment of a patient. A licensee practicing telemedicine shall verify the identity of the patient seeking care and shall disclose, and ensure the patient has the ability to verify, the identity and licensure status of any licensee providing medical services to the patient.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-17s43-17-44ol13">
       Before initially diagnosing or treating a patient for a specific illness or condition, an examination or evaluation must be performed. An examination or evaluation may be performed entirely through telemedicine, if the examination or evaluation is equivalent to an in-person examination.
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43c43-17s43-17-44ol13a">
         An examination utilizing secure videoconferencing or store-and-forward technology for appropriate diagnostic testing and use of peripherals that would be deemed necessary in a like in-person examination or evaluation meets this standard, as does an examination conducted with an appropriately licensed intervening health care provider, practicing within the scope of the provider’s profession, providing necessary physical findings to the licensee. An examination or evaluation consisting only of a static online questionnaire or an audio conversation does not meet the standard of care.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c43-17s43-17-44ol13b">
         Once a licensee conducts an acceptable examination or evaluation, whether in-person or by telemedicine, and establishes a patient-licensee relationship, subsequent followup care may be provided as deemed appropriate by the licensee, or by a provider designated by the licensee to act temporarily in the licensee’s absence. In certain types of telemedicine utilizing asynchronous store-and-forward technology or electronic monitoring, such as teleradiology or intensive care unit monitoring, it is not medically necessary for an independent examination of the patient to be performed.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-17s43-17-44ol14">
       A licensee practicing telemedicine is subject to all North Dakota laws governing the adequacy of medical records and the provision of medical records to the patient and other medical providers treating the patient.

       A licensee must have the ability to make appropriate referrals of patients not amenable to diagnosis or complete treatment through a telemedicine encounter, including a patient in need of emergent care or complementary in-person care.

        Investigator’s Conflict of Interest.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Doctor’s right to due process was not violated during medical board disciplinary proceedings where one of the investigators for the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners had an alleged personal and financial conflict of interest in the case, because the statutory scheme for the Board and its investigative panels precluded Board members, like the investigator who served on an investigative panel, from participating in adjudicatory proceedings before the Board on that complaint. The statutory scheme for the Board’s investigative panels, coupled with the other statutory procedures for adjudication by the Board, provided adequate procedural safeguards to satisfy the requirements for due process, and the investigator’s participation in the investigation of the complaints did not violate due process and, therefore, the district court did not err in deciding the Board did not violate the doctor’s due process or equal protection rights.

      If the board determines a licensee currently exhibits possible impairment, the board may direct that an evaluation of the licensee be conducted by the physician health program or by the committee or designated agency for the purpose of determining whether there is a current need for treatment or monitoring of the licensee to assure the licensee is able to practice safely. The physician health program shall report the findings of this evaluation to the board. As a condition of application, every applicant for initial licensure or renewal of licensure shall agree to submit to such an evaluation for cause within a specified time frame, and to the release of the results of the evaluation to the board.

       ARTICLE I — PURPOSE
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the interstate medical licensure compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards and provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state’s existing medical practice act. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact.

      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      The interstate commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the interstate commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the compact, or the powers granted under the compact, such an action by the interstate commission must be invalid and have no force or effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the interstate commission must be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the model state administrative procedure act of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      Not later than thirty days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, provided that the filing of such a petition may not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and may not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the interstate commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE XVI — OVERSIGHT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact’s purposes and intent. The provisions of the compact and the rules promulgated under the compact must have standing as statutory law but may not override existing state authority to regulate the practice of medicine.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of the compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      The interstate commission must be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and must have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission renders a judgment or order void as to the interstate commission, the compact, or promulgated rules.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE XVII — ENFORCEMENT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      The interstate commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the commissioners, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia, or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, and its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney’s fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      The remedies in this chapter may not be the exclusive remedies of the interstate commission. The interstate commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE XVIII — DEFAULT PROCEDURES
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      The grounds for default, include failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by the compact or the rules and bylaws of the interstate commission promulgated under the compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      If the interstate commission determines a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the interstate commission shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       a.
      </b>
      Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states, of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       b.
      </b>
      Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state must be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the compact must terminate on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       4.
      </b>
      Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate must be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state’s legislature, and each of the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       5.
      </b>
      The interstate commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licenses and physicians that are materially impacted by the termination of a member state or the withdrawal of a member state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       6.
      </b>
      The member state that has been terminated is responsible for all dues, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       7.
      </b>
      The interstate commission may not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       8.
      </b>
      The defaulting state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party must be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney’s fees.

      <b>
       3.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       4.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      Withdrawal from the compact must be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but may not take effect until one year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member state.

       ARTICLE XXII — DISSOLUTION
      </b>

     <p>
      <b>
       1.

      The compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the member state which reduces the membership in the compact to one member state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.

Such fee may not exceed two hundred dollars for a master plumber’s certificate and license and one hundred dollars for a journeyman plumber’s certificate and license. The board, when the condition of its fund permits and when in its judgment it is deemed advisable, may reduce the amount of the examination fees, but it may not increase the same above the amount specified in this section. Any such change must be adopted by the board to take effect on the first day of January following its action and must apply to all examination fees in the classes specified in the ruling. The applicant shall appear at the next regular meeting of the board for examination of applicants. If upon examination the applicant is found by the board to be qualified as a master plumber or journeyman plumber, or both, it shall issue to the applicant a certificate of registration and license which entitles the applicant to do the work and be a plumber as specified in the license. A master plumber’s and journeyman plumber’s license may be issued to one and the same person, and the holder of a master plumber’s license may be granted a journeyman plumber’s license without the payment of the journeyman’s fee. All certificates and licenses must be numbered consecutively and may not be transferable, and no person may work under the license issued to another person. Should a person fail upon examination to qualify as a master or journeyman plumber, such person has the right to review the examination to determine the reasons for failure and has the right to appeal to the board.

It is unlawful for any person to practice, or to offer to practice, professional engineering or land surveying in this state, as defined in the provisions of this chapter, or to use in connection with the person’s name or otherwise assume, or advertise any title or description tending to convey the impression that the person is an engineer or land surveyor, unless such person has been duly registered or exempted under the provisions of this chapter. The right to engage in the practice of engineering or land surveying is deemed a personal right, based on the qualifications of the individual as evidenced by the individual’s certificate of registration, which is not transferable.

       Decision of the Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors that an engineer violated regulations relating to disclosure of confidential information was supported by a preponderance of the evidence because the engineer’s information regarding a consulting services agreement was in connection with a specific project in which he gained specialized knowledge; the engineer had knowledge of the services while working for an employer and worked on the project for a competitor. Berg v. N.D. State Bd. of Registration for Prof'l Eng'rs &amp; Land Surveyors, 2018 ND 274, 920 N.W.2d 896, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       Decision of the Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors that an engineer violated regulations relating to disclosure of confidential information was supported by a preponderance of the evidence because the Board found that the engineer disclosed his employer’s financial information relating to its transportation department. Berg v. N.D. State Bd. of Registration for Prof'l Eng'rs &amp; Land Surveyors, 2018 ND 274, 920 N.W.2d 896, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision of the Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors that an engineer violated regulations relating to disclosure of confidential information was supported by a preponderance of the evidence because the engineer, as an agent of a competitor, disclosed an employer’s confidential information to the competitor; the engineer downloaded the contents of his computer hard drive onto an external hard drive and attached the hard drive to his laptop with the competitor. Berg v. N.D. State Bd. of Registration for Prof'l Eng'rs &amp; Land Surveyors, 2018 ND 274, 920 N.W.2d 896, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 2018).

      <p>
       Factual findings of the North Dakota State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors regarding engineers’ failure to disclose a known or potential conflict of interest were supported by a preponderance of the evidence because their judgment and services were influenced or could have been influenced by their decision to form a competing firm; the engineers failed to disclose to the employer their participation in the formation and planning of a competitive business. Berg v. N.D. State Bd. of Registration for Prof'l Eng'rs &amp; Land Surveyors, 2018 ND 274, 920 N.W.2d 896, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Preponderance of the evidence supported the factual findings of the North Dakota State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors regarding engineers’ improper solicitation because the engineers knowingly sought or accepted employment for professional services for an assignment for which their former employer was previously employed or contracted to perform. Berg v. N.D. State Bd. of Registration for Prof'l Eng'rs &amp; Land Surveyors, 2018 ND 274, 920 N.W.2d 896, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 2018).

      Any person may file charges of fraud, deceit, gross negligence, incompetence, misconduct, or violation of the code of ethics against any individual registrant. Such charges must be in writing and must be filed with the secretary of the board. All charges, unless dismissed by the board as unfounded or trivial, must be heard by the board within six months following the filing of charges unless the accused registrant waives this requirement. The matters considered at the hearing must include all charges made in the original filing, together with any related or additional matters or charges that arise in connection with the investigation of the original charges, and which are set forth in a specification of issues for the hearing. The time and place for the hearing must be fixed by the board and a copy of the charges, together with a notice of the time and place of hearing, and a specification of the issues to be considered at the hearing must be served upon the accused registrant either personally or sent by registered mail to the last-known address of the registrant at least thirty days before the date fixed for hearing. At any hearing the accused registrant has the right to appear in person or by counsel, or both; to cross-examine witnesses appearing against the accused; and to produce evidence and witnesses in defense of the accused. If the accused fails or refuses to appear, the board may proceed to hear and determine the validity of the issues set forth in the specification of issues. Following the hearing, the board members who did not serve on the investigative panel shall deliberate in executive session and if a majority of the board members who did not serve on the investigative panel vote in favor of sustaining all or part of the issues set forth in the specification of issues, the board shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law and shall issue the board’s order and serve the findings, conclusions, and order upon the accused. In the order the board may reprimand, suspend, refuse to renew, or revoke the accused registrant’s certificate of registration. Any registrant who feels aggrieved by any action of the board in denying, suspending, refusing to renew, or revoking that registrant’s certificate of registration may appeal the board’s action to the district court under the procedures provided by chapter 28-32.

     <p>
      As used in this chapter, “dental hygiene” and the practice thereof means the removal of accumulated matter from the natural and restored surfaces of teeth and from restorations in the human mouth, the polishing of such surfaces, and the topical application of drugs to the surface tissues of the mouth and to the surface of teeth if such acts are performed under the direct, indirect, or general supervision of a licensed dentist. General supervision may be used if the procedures are authorized in advance by the supervising dentist, except procedures which may only be used under direct supervision as established by the board by rule.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only a person licensed as a dental hygienist may be referred to as a dental hygienist. Additional tasks permitted to be performed by licensed dental hygienists may be outlined by the board of dental examiners by appropriate rules.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A licensed dentist may delegate to a competent dental hygienist those procedures over which the dentist exercises full responsibility, except those procedures that require professional judgment and skill such as diagnosis and treatment planning, the cutting of hard or soft tissue, or any intraoral procedure which would lead to the fabrication of any appliance that, when worn by the patient, would come in direct contact with hard or soft tissue and which could result in tissue irritation or injury. The board of dental examiners may adopt rules governing the scope of practice of dental hygienists.

       Every individual, partnership, association, corporation, or limited liability company licensed as a real estate broker is required to have and maintain a definite place of business within this state, for the transaction of real estate business, except as provided in section 43-23-10. The license as broker and the license of each real estate salesperson licensed under that broker must be prominently displayed in said office or the licensee’s name and license number listed on the broker’s website. The place of business must be designated in the license, and a license issued under the authority of this chapter may not authorize the licensee to transact business under any other broker. In case of removal from the designated broker, the licensee shall make application to the commission before the removal or within five days after the removal, designating the new location of such office, whereupon the commission immediately shall issue a new license for the new location for the unexpired period. The broker’s home may qualify as the place of business.

       All licenses issued to real estate salespersons must designate the broker of the salespersons. Prompt notice in writing, within five days, must be given to the commission by any real estate salesperson of a change of broker, and of the name of the licensed broker into whose supervision the salesperson is about to enter, and a new license must be issued by the commission to the salesperson for the unexpired term of the original license, upon the return to the commission of the license previously issued. The change of broker by any licensed real estate salesperson, without notice to the commission, automatically cancels that person’s license. Upon termination of a real estate salesperson’s supervision by a broker, the broker immediately shall notify the commission in writing. It is unlawful for any real estate salesperson to perform any of the acts contemplated by this chapter either directly or indirectly after that person’s supervision by a broker has been terminated, until the license has been reissued by the commission to a new broker.

      Every person licensed to practice as a real estate broker or real estate salesperson shall register annually with the commission and pay the appropriate annual renewal fee as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c43-23s43-23-13" target="_self">43-23-13</a></cite>. The application for renewal must be accompanied by such certification as required by this chapter and rules of the commission to show compliance with the educational requirements of sections 43-23-08 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c43-23s43-23-08" target="_self">43-23-08</a></cite>.2, and must be submitted to the commission with the appropriate fee no later than the application deadline set by the commission. A licensee that fails to file a timely application for the renewal of any license and pay the renewal fee on or before the application deadline may file a late renewal application, together with the required educational certification, before January fifteenth of the subsequent year and shall pay, in addition to the renewal fee, a late fee as set by the commission for each month or fraction of a month after the application deadline. Any license not renewed by January fifteenth must be canceled. The cancellation must be performed without any notice or opportunity for hearing. Any person whose license has been canceled and which desires relicensure must be required to satisfy the application and examination requirements for prospective licensees in accordance with this chapter and rules of the commission.

     <p>
      A licensee may not engage in any activity after December thirty-first of any year for which a license is required under this chapter unless that person’s license has been renewed by the commission.

    Handling of funds by brokers.

     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this section, every broker, at all times, shall maintain in the broker’s name or firm name, a separate, noninterest-bearing trust account designated as such in a federally insured financial institution in this state in which the broker immediately shall place as a demand deposit all funds not the broker’s own coming into the broker’s possession, in accordance with rules adopted by the commission. This requirement extends to funds in which the broker may have some future interest or claim and includes earnest money deposits. A broker may not commingle the broker’s personal funds or other funds in a trust account, except a broker may deposit and keep a sum not to exceed five hundred dollars in the account from the broker’s personal funds, which sum must be specifically identified and deposited to cover service charges related to the trust account. In conjunction with the account, the broker shall maintain at the broker’s usual place of business, books, records, contracts, and other necessary documents so the adequacy of the account may be determined at any time. Trust accounts and other records must be open to inspection by the commission and the commission’s duly authorized agents at all times during regular business hours at the broker’s usual place of business.
     </p>
     <p>
      A broker that does not accept trust funds in real estate brokerage transactions and which has applied for and received a waiver from the real estate commission is not required to maintain a designated trust account. However, if a broker does not maintain a trust account and later receives trust funds in a real estate brokerage transaction, the broker shall open a designated trust account as required by this section and deposit any trust funds in accordance with rules adopted by the commission. A broker shall maintain a record tracking the earnest money associated with all transactions even if the funds are deposited directly with the title company and the broker does not take possession of the funds.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When any aggrieved person obtains a final judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction against any person licensed under chapter 43-23, on grounds of fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, or conversion of trust funds arising directly out of any act or transaction when the judgment debtor was licensed and performed acts for which a license is required under chapter 43-23, the aggrieved person may, upon obtaining such final judgment, file an application in the court in which the judgment was entered for an order directing payment out of the fund in the amount of the actual and direct loss up to the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, unpaid on the judgment, provided that nothing contained within this chapter may be construed to obligate the fund for more than fifteen thousand dollars per transaction regardless of the number of persons aggrieved or parcels of real estate involved in the transaction. The application must be verified and must be served on the commission and upon the judgment debtor and an affidavit of service filed with the court.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the court proceeds upon an application as set forth in this chapter, it shall order payment out of the real estate education, research, and recovery fund only upon a determination that the aggrieved party has a valid claim for relief within the purview of this chapter and has complied with the provisions of this chapter. The judgment is only prima facie evidence of such claim for relief and for the purposes of this chapter is not conclusive. The commission may defend any such action on behalf of the fund and has recourse to all appropriate means of defense and review including examination of witnesses. The commission may move the court at any time to dismiss the application when it appears there are no triable issues and the petition is without merit. The motion may be supported by affidavit of any person or persons having knowledge of the facts, and may be made on the basis that the petition, and the judgment referred to therein, does not form the basis for a meritorious recovery claim within the purview of this chapter; provided, however, the commission shall give written notice at least ten days before such motion. The commission may, subject to court approval, compromise a claim based upon the application of an aggrieved party. It is not bound by any prior compromise or stipulation of the judgment debtor.

     <p>
      The judgment debtor may defend any such action on the judgment debtor’s own behalf and has recourse to all appropriate means of defense and review, including examination of witnesses. Whenever an applicant’s judgment is by default, stipulation, or consent, or whenever the action against the licensee was defended by a trustee in bankruptcy, the applicant has the burden of proving any claim for relief for fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, or conversion of trust funds. Otherwise, the judgment creates a rebuttable presumption of the fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, or conversion of trust funds. This presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the liability of that portion of the fund allocated for the purposes of this chapter may not exceed fifteen thousand dollars for any one licensee. If the fifteen thousand dollar liability of the fund is insufficient to pay in full the valid claims of all aggrieved persons by whom claims have been filed against any one licensee, such fifteen thousand dollars must be distributed among them in the ratio that their respective claims bear to the aggregate of such valid claims or in such other manner as the court deems equitable. Distribution of such moneys must be among the persons entitled to share therein, without regard to the order or priority in which their respective judgments may have been obtained or their claims have been filed. Upon petition of the commission the court may require all claimants and prospective claimants against one licensee to be joined in one action, to the end that the respective rights of all such claimants to the fund may be equitably adjudicated and settled.

      Should the commission pay from the fund any amount in settlement of a claim or toward satisfaction of a judgment against a licensed broker or salesperson, the license of the broker or salesperson must be automatically suspended upon the effective date of an order by the court as set forth herein authorizing payment from the fund. No such broker or salesperson may be granted reinstatement until having repaid in full, plus interest at the rate of four percent a year, the amount paid from the fund on that person’s account. A discharge in bankruptcy does not relieve a person from the penalties and disabilities provided in this chapter.

      If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.

      <b>
       c.
      </b>
      Termination of membership in the compact must be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted.

     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       d.

      The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       f.
      </b>
      The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States district court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices. The prevailing member must be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

       a.

     <p>
      <b>
       b.

       4.

      <b>
       5.

       ARTICLE XII — CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY
      </b>

     <p>
      This compact must be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes of the compact. The provisions of this compact are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of the remainder of this compact to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is not affected thereby.

Such records, or a transcript of the same or any part thereof, under the seal of the board, duly certified by its secretary-treasurer, are competent evidence of the facts therein stated. A certificate of the secretary-treasurer under the seal of the board stating that any person is or is not a duly licensed and registered dentist is prima facie evidence of such fact.

    Standard of care and professional ethics — Telehealth.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A dentist is held to the same standard of care and ethical standards, whether practicing traditional in-person dentistry or telehealth. The following apply in the context of telehealth:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t43c43-28s43-28-11.5ol11">
       Professional ethical standards require a dentist to practice only in areas in which the dentist has demonstrated competence, based on the dentist’s training, ability, and experience.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-28s43-28-11.5ol12">
       A dentist may not practice telehealth unless a bona fide dentist-patient relationship is established in person or through telehealth. A dentist practicing telehealth shall verify the identity of the patient seeking care and shall disclose to the patient the dentist’s identity, physical location, contact information, and licensure status.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-28s43-28-11.5ol13">
       Before a dentist initially diagnoses or treats a patient for a specific illness, disease, or condition, the dentist shall perform an examination or evaluation. A dentist may perform an examination or evaluation entirely through telehealth if the examination or evaluation may be performed in accordance with the standard of care required for an in-person dental examination or evaluation. A dentist may not use telehealth to perform an initial examination or evaluation in circumstances in which the standard of care necessitates an in-person dental examination.
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t43c43-28s43-28-11.5ol13a">
         An appropriate telehealth examination or evaluation may include an examination utilizing secure videoconferencing in conjunction with store-and-forward technology or appropriate diagnostic testing that would be required during an in-person examination or evaluation or an examination conducted with an appropriately licensed intervening dental health care provider, practicing within the scope of the dental health care provider’s profession, providing necessary physical findings to the dentist during a live, two-way telehealth encounter. An examination or evaluation consisting only of a static online questionnaire or an audio conversation does not meet the standard of care.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c43-28s43-28-11.5ol13b">
         The use of telehealth does not expand the scope of practice for a dental health care provider, and may not be used to circumvent the licensure requirements established for dental health care providers in this state.
        </li>
        <li id="t43c43-28s43-28-11.5ol13c">
         A dentist who practices telehealth in this state must have adequate knowledge of the availability and location of local dentists and dental health care providers to provide followup care to a patient following a dental telehealth encounter, including emergent and acute care facilities, in order to enable a patient to receive followup care. Once a dentist conducts an appropriate examination or evaluation, whether in-person or by telehealth, and establishes a patient-dentist relationship, subsequent followup care may be provided as deemed appropriate by the treating dentist, or by another dentist licensed by the board designated by the treating dentist to act temporarily in the treating dentist’s absence.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-28s43-28-11.5ol14">
       A dentist practicing telehealth is subject to all North Dakota laws governing the adequacy of dental records and the provision of dental records to the patient and other dental health care providers treating the patient.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-28s43-28-11.5ol15">
       A dentist practicing telehealth must have procedures for providing in-person services or for the referral of a patient requiring dental services that cannot be provided by telehealth to another dentist who practices in the area of the state and the patient can readily access.

      Any dentist who does not undertake the actual practice of dentistry within five years from the date of the dentist’s license and registration, shall, before engaging in the practice of dentistry in this state, notify the board of the intention in writing. The board, after a full investigation, may re-examine the dentist as to the dentist’s qualifications to practice dentistry in this state, if the board deems such re-examination necessary. The failure of the dentist to give the written notice to the board before engaging in the practice of dentistry in this state is grounds for disciplinary action.

      The state health council may provide for loan repayment funds to a dentist who has received an education loan. The council may not provide funds for the repayment of any loan that is in default at the time of the application. The amount of repayment must be related to the dentist’s outstanding education loans. A dentist is eligible to receive loan repayment funds in an amount equal to the outstanding balance of the dentist’s education loans with applicable interest, or one hundred thousand dollars, whichever is less. Loan repayment funds may not be used to satisfy other service obligations under similar programs.

Upon receiving a complaint, the board shall notify the veterinarian of the complaint and request a written response from the veterinarian. The board may adopt rules establishing a peer review committee for the purpose of investigating complaints and providing recommendations to the board. A veterinarian who is the subject of an investigation by the board shall cooperate fully with the investigation. Cooperation includes responding fully and promptly to any reasonable question raised by or on behalf of the board relating to the subject of the investigation and providing copies of records when reasonably requested by the board.

       To pursue the investigation, the board may subpoena and examine witnesses and records, including medical records, copy, photograph, or take samples. The board may require the veterinarian to give statements under oath, to submit to a physical or psychological examination, or both, by a physician or other qualified evaluation professional selected by the board if it appears to be in the best interest of the public that this evaluation be secured. After review of the complaint, the veterinarian’s response, and information obtained in the investigation, the board shall determine if there is a reasonable basis to believe the allegations are true and that the allegations constitute a violation of this chapter or the rules of the board. If the board determines there is a reasonable basis to believe the allegations are true and the allegations constitute a violation of this chapter or the rules of the board, the board shall take appropriate action. If a reasonable basis is not found by the board, the board shall notify the complaining party and the veterinarian in writing.

     <p>
      Every person who desires to obtain a license or registration, including nonlicensed members, partners, officers, and owners of at least ten percent interest in the entity, shall apply to the board on applications prepared and furnished by the board. Each application must include the information required by the board and must be accompanied by the required fee. As a requirement of receiving a license or registration, the board shall require each applicant to submit to a state and nationwide criminal history background record check. The nationwide criminal history background record check must be conducted in the manner provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.12.html#t12c12-60s12-60-24" target="_blank">12-60-24</a></cite>. All costs associated with the criminal history background record check are the responsibility of the applicant. Criminal history records provided to the board pursuant to this section are confidential and closed to the public and may be used by the board for the sole purpose of determining an applicant’s eligibility for licensure and obtaining documentation to support a denial of licensure. A criminal history background record check is not required under this section if an applicant for registration has previously been the subject of a state and nationwide criminal history background record check, has held a registration issued by the board within the sixty days immediately preceding the application, and is applying for a new registration due solely to a change in employment. A nationwide criminal history background record check is not required under this section if an applicant for licensure or registration provides to the board the results of a nationwide criminal history background record check performed by the federal bureau of investigation at the request of another state and if the nationwide criminal history background record check was performed within the sixty days immediately preceding the date of the application. A state criminal history background record check is not required under this section if an applicant for registration provides to the board the results of a state criminal history background record check performed by the state in which the applicant currently resides and if the state criminal history background record check was performed within the sixty days immediately preceding the date of the application.

In addition to the criminal penalties provided, the civil remedy of an injunction is available to restrain and enjoin violations of any provisions of this chapter, without proof of actual damages sustained by any person.

The board may seek costs for reimbursement of expenses for obtaining an injunction, including attorney’s fees. In addition to issuing the injunction, the court may impose an administrative fee consistent with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t43c43-30s43-30-10" target="_self">43-30-10</a></cite>.1 if the person has violated a provision of this chapter.

      A state board of registration for professional soil classifiers is hereby created whose duty it is to administer the provisions of this chapter. The board consists of three professional soil classifiers appointed by the governor and two members at large appointed by the governor. The members of the board must be appointed for five years, staggered so the term of one member expires June thirtieth of each year and so that the terms of the members at large do not expire in consecutive years. Each member of the board shall receive a certificate of that member’s appointment from the governor and shall file with the secretary of state a written oath and affirmation of the faithful discharge of the member’s official duties. On the expiration of the term of any member, the governor shall in the manner hereinbefore provided appoint for a term of five years a registered professional soil classifier or a member at large to take the place of the member whose term on said board is about to expire. A member may be reappointed. Each member shall hold office until a successor has been duly appointed and has qualified.

The time and place for said hearing must be fixed by the board and a copy of the charges together with a notice of the time and place of hearing must be served upon the accused either personally or sent by registered or certified mail to the last-known address of such individual registrant at least thirty days before the date fixed for hearing. At any hearing the accused registrant has the right to appear in person or by counsel, or both, to cross-examine witnesses appearing against the accused, and to produce evidence and witnesses in defense of the accused. If the accused person fails or refuses to appear, the board may proceed to hear and determine the validity of the charges. If after such hearing a majority of the board votes in favor of sustaining the charges, the board shall make findings of fact, draw its conclusions and issue its order therein and serve the same upon the accused. In said order the board may reprimand, suspend, refuse to renew, or revoke the accused individual’s certificate of registration. Any person who feels aggrieved by any action of the board in denying, suspending, refusing to renew, or revoking that person’s certificate of registration may appeal therefrom to the district court under the procedures provided by chapter 28-32.

      <li id="t43c43-37s43-37-05ol13">
       Each board member shall hold office for three years and until a successor is appointed and qualified. The terms must be arranged so no more than four terms expire on July first of each year. The governor shall fill vacancies for an unexpired term. An individual may not serve more than two successive terms.
      </li>
      <li id="t43c43-37s43-37-05ol14">
       The board shall meet at least twice each calendar year. Special meetings may be convened at the call of the chairman or at the written request of any three board members.

       Five members of the board constitute a quorum. When an application for licensure is received, one member of the quorum must be engaged in the profession for which a license is sought. In the case of an application for licensure as a speech-language pathology assistant, a speech-language pathologist must be a member of the quorum.

       “Occupational therapy practice” means the use of occupation and purposeful activity or intervention designed to achieve functional outcomes that promote health, prevent injury or disability, and which develop, improve, sustain, or restore the highest possible level of independence of any individual who has an injury, illness, cognitive impairment, psychosocial dysfunction, mental illness, developmental or learning disability, physical disability or other disorder or condition, and occupational therapy education. Occupational therapy encompasses evaluation, treatment, consultation, research, and education. Occupational therapy practice includes evaluation by skilled observation, administration, and interpretation of standardized and nonstandardized tests and measurements. The occupational therapy practitioner designs and implements interventions directed toward developing, improving, sustaining, and restoring sensorimotor, neuromuscular, emotional, cognitive, or psychosocial performance components. Interventions include activities that contribute to optimal occupational performance including self-care; daily living skills; skills essential for productivity, functional communication and mobility; positioning; social integration; cognitive mechanisms; enhancing play and leisure skills; and the design, provision, and training in the use of assistive technology, devices, orthotics, or prosthetics or environmental adaptations to accommodate for loss of occupational performance. Therapy may be provided individually or in groups to prevent secondary conditions, promote community integration, and support the individual’s health and well-being within the social and cultural contexts of the individual’s natural environment.

Failure to satisfactorily undergo an examination or enroll in a treatment and monitoring program must be reported to the board by the treating professional.

A licensee is deemed to consent to the treating professional of the approved evaluation, or the approved treatment and monitoring program, reporting to the board on the results of the examination or the progress of the treatment or monitoring program, at such intervals the board deems necessary. The approved examination, or treatment or monitoring program, may release examination information, or treatment or monitoring information, to the board so the board may evaluate the results of the examination or the licensee’s progress in and the effectiveness of the treatment or monitoring program. A written request from the board constitutes authorization to release information. Absent a client release on file allowing the release of information, all client records released to the board are confidential and are not public records.

      Upon prior written application to the board, a foreign practitioner practicing under this section may provide medical nutrition therapy or nutrition care services for the purpose of treating or managing a disease or medical condition in this state under section 43-51-05 if the practitioner is acting within the scope of practice designated by the foreign practitioner’s license and by this title without obtaining a license from the board if the services are provided for no more than thirty full or partial days per year. The one-year period commences on the date the written application is approved by the board. An application from a foreign practitioner under this section must include verified documentation from the appropriate licensing authority which identifies the requirements for licensure in that jurisdiction and which confirms that the practitioner is licensed and in good standing in that jurisdiction and any other information requested by the board. The board may require payment of a fee of twenty-five dollars or other fee established by the board by administrative rule, not to exceed the higher of twenty-five dollars or one-tenth of the fee for an annual license from the board, as a condition of approving an application under this section. A foreign practitioner is subject to the regulatory and disciplinary provisions of section 43-51-08 and this chapter.
