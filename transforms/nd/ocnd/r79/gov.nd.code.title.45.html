      A partner does not have a right to demand or receive any distribution from a limited partnership in any form other than cash. Subject to subsection 2 of section 45-10.2-75, a limited partnership may distribute an asset in kind to the extent each partner receives a percentage of the asset equal to the share of distributions of the partner.

      When a partner or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the partner or transferee has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited partnership with respect to the distribution. However, the obligation of the limited partnership to make a distribution is subject to offset for any amount owed to the limited partnership by the partner or dissociated partner on whose account the distribution is made.

        The failure of a partnership, doing business under a fictitious name, to file certificate stating names of members of partnership and publish same, constituted an affirmative defense to an action brought by the partnership, which would be waived if not raised by answer or by a proper and timely motion. Such failure did not affect the jurisdiction of the court nor the validity of a judgment entered in an action where the defense was not pleaded. Newcastle Drilling Co. v. Thorndal, 105 N.W.2d 332, 1960 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1960).

      A partnership may file a fictitious name certificate by electronic communication with the secretary of state. The following definitions apply to electronic fictitious name certificate filings with the secretary of state:
     </p>

      <li id="t45c45-11s45-11-02.1ol12">
       “Electronic communication” means any form of communication acceptable to the secretary of state, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper:

      A fictitious name certificate filed under this chapter must be renewed every five years from the date of the initial filing. The statement of renewal must be executed by the partnership on forms prescribed by the secretary of state. The statement must include the fictitious name of the partnership, the state or country of organization, the address of the principal place of business, a brief description of the nature of business in which the partnership is engaged in this state, the names and addresses of all general partners, and a statement that the partnership is still in existence and continues to transact business in this state. If the secretary of state finds that the statement conforms to the requirements of this section, and the filing fee of twenty-five dollars has been paid, the secretary of state shall file the statement. If the secretary of state finds that it does not so conform, the secretary of state shall promptly return the statement to the partnership for any necessary corrections, in which event, the fictitious name certificate is subject to cancellation if the statement is not returned corrected within thirty days after the statement was returned for corrections. If the statement of renewal reflects a change of membership, the statement of renewal may not be filed until payment of the fees required for these changes are paid as required by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t45c45-11s45-11-05" target="_self">45-11-05</a></cite>.1. The secretary of state shall provide notice sent to the address of the principal place of business at least ninety days before the deadline for filing the state of renewal. If a partnership fails to file the statement of renewal when due, the fictitious name certificate must be canceled by the secretary of state and notice of the cancellation must be mailed to the address of the principal place of business.

       Fact that brothers allocated each year’s profits from cattle ranch equally on partnership income tax return, with each party being liable for his share of the profits on his personal income tax return was evidence of a partnership between the parties.

       Trial court did not err in concluding that a partnership did not exist between plaintiffs and defendants in an action for breach of fiduciary duty where the purchase of oil and gas leases was a separate act undertaken by the parties, not a series of acts that would constitute a business as defined by N.D.C.C. § 45-13-01(4) and as interpreted by the commentary to the Revised Uniform Partnership Act.

        Where two parties made contributions to an enterprise to build and sell airplanes, they both exerted a degree of control, there was a written contract, and there was an intent to share the profits based on a designer’s broad role in the operation, a designer had the authority to bind the venture under N.D.C.C. § 45-15-01(1) when he forfeited his rights to a plane pledged as security for a loan. Moreover, a lender was not required to sell the plane in a commercially reasonable manner because notice to one party was notice to the joint venture under N.D.C.C. § 45-13-02(6), and the lender had no knowledge of another party’s alleged security interest in the plane.

        In a partnership dispute, a district court’s finding that the partners had agreed there would be no accounting or equalization of unequal real estate contributions to pay partnership debt was not clearly erroneous. N.D.C.C. § 45-16-01 did not mandate a credit for unequal contributions when the partners had agreed otherwise.

      <p>
       One of the essential elements to be shown to establish a partnership was the sharing of profits. Oelkers v. Pendergrast, 73 N.D. 63, 11 N.W.2d 116, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Elements of a partnership are: an association, or an intention to be partners; co-ownership of, and a community of interest in, the business of the partnership; and a profit motive. Gangl v. Gangl, 281 N.W.2d 574, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 275</cite> (N.D. 1979).

      <p>
       Partnership is the association of two or more persons for the purpose of carrying on business together and dividing the profits between them. Degen v. Brooks, 77 N.D. 514, 43 N.W.2d 755, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1950).

       Where several persons leased land as tenants in common, each person using the land as pasturage for his cattle or for his individual benefit, there was no partnership. Weber v. Bader, 42 N.D. 142, 172 N.W. 72, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 127</cite> (N.D. 1919).

      <p>
       An agreement to give compensation in addition to the rate of interest for a loan of money, the compensation depending upon the amount of money received under a contract to grade roads, did not make the parties copartners in the grading of roads.

      </p>
      <p>
       Partnership relationship did not exist where capital supplied, transactions carried out, records, and decisions were all attributable to only one party and there was no profit-sharing arrangement.

      <p>
       Partnership relationship did not exist where, although parties conducted business for a profit and shared in the profits and there was mutual ownership of some of the business assets, there was no sharing in losses, most of the business assets were individually owned, and the individuals could not prove each had a right of control or that they were intended to have a right of control over the management of the business.

       A partnership is to be determined from the intention of the parties as expressed in the partnership agreement or gathered from the acts and circumstances. It is a relation arising out of contract, and a partnership inter sese arises only out of the contract of the parties as expressed in their agreement or implied by their dealings with each other.

        Phrase “whether or not the persons intend to form a partnership” in N.D.C.C. § 45-14-02 was not intended to change the elements of partnership formation but was intended to clarify that a partnership is created by the association of persons whose intent is to carry on as co-owners a business for profit, regardless of their subjective intention to be “partners,” making it possible for individuals to inadvertently create a partnership despite their expressed subjective intent not to do so.

        No partnership was formed where there was no evidence that the owners of an ice fishing guide service intended to engage in activities that would form a partnership with plaintiff employees. The parties did not file a partnership tax return, one of the owners handled all of the administrative activities, each party provided his own equipment, all of the major decisions were made without the input and direction of the plaintiffs, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the discussions they had with the owner were about the management and control of the business and that their discussions affected the activities of the company, each party in the company received his own fees for guide services and the fee structure used by the company correlated more closely with an independent contractor payment system than with profit sharing among partners.

        Limited liability partnership had standing to sue in an option contract case because, as of a September 19, 2012, order, the partnership’s registration had not been forfeited, nor had the North Dakota Secretary of State revoked its registration; moreover, a website status that listed it as “not good standing” was from significantly before the registration would have been forfeited. Even if the registration had been revoked, the partnership would have continued as a legal entity with the ability to sue and be sued. Guthmiller Farms, LLP v.

       Where two parties made contributions to an enterprise to build and sell airplanes, they both exerted a degree of control, there was a written contract, and there was an intent to share the profits based on a designer’s broad role in the operation, a designer had the authority to bind the venture under N.D.C.C. § 45-15-01(1) when he forfeited his rights to a plane pledged as security for a loan. Moreover, a lender was not required to sell the plane in a commercially reasonable manner because notice to one party was notice to the joint venture under N.D.C.C. § 45-13-02(6), and the lender had no knowledge of another party’s alleged security interest in the plane.

       When general partners personally guaranty a general partnership mortgage debt, the anti-deficiency statutes are applicable, and the procedures for deficiency judgments outlined in First State Bank v. Ihringer, 217 N.W.2d 857 (1974) must be satisfied. However, because of contractual expectations, this decision will be applied prospectively. First Interstate Bank, N.A. v. Larson, 475 N.W.2d 538, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       By 1993 legislation, the Legislature removed anti-deficiency protection from a group that the Supreme Court had previously held was protected. The Legislature clearly signaled an intent not to protect guarantors with the anti-deficiency statutes. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Anseth, 503 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        Limited liability partnership had standing to sue in an option contract case because, as of a September 19, 2012, order, the partnership’s registration had not been forfeited, nor had the North Dakota Secretary of State revoked its registration; moreover, a website status that listed it as “not good standing” was from significantly before the registration would have been forfeited. Even if the registration had been revoked, the partnership would have continued as a legal entity with the ability to sue and be sued. Guthmiller Farms, LLP v.

       If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. If the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner’s consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies upon the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.

If all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or obligation results. If fewer than all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable.

        Since a bank’s knowledge of defendant’s business activities or history of writing NSF checks did not create a partnership by estoppel, plaintiff’s complaint did not state a claim upon which relief could be granted for liability of the bank as a partner by estoppel of defendant. Rolin Mfg. v. Mosbrucker, 544 N.W.2d 132, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 48</cite> (N.D. 1996).

         “Ostensible Partnership”.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The doctrine of ostensible partnership rested on estoppel and, though no partnership in fact existed, one could be subject to the same liabilities as if he were a partner by holding himself out as a partner or knowingly or negligently permitting others to do so. Oelkers v. Pendergrast, 73 N.D. 63, 11 N.W.2d 116, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        An “ostensible partnership” is essentially equivalent to a partnership by estoppel. Merwin v. Ziebarth, 252 N.W.2d 193, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 1977).

       If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under section 45-20-01, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner’s interest in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subsection 2.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c45-19s45-19-01ol12">
       The buyout price of a dissociated partner’s interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under subsection 2 of section 45-20-07 if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the dissociated partner and the partnership were wound up as of that date. Interest must be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c45-19s45-19-01ol13">
       Damages for wrongful dissociation under subsection 2 of section 45-18-02, and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated partner to the partnership, must be offset against the buyout price. Interest must be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c45-19s45-19-01ol14">
       A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the dissociated partner under section 45-19-02.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c45-19s45-19-01ol15">
       If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partner’s interest is reached within one hundred twenty days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the dissociated partner the amount the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection 3.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c45-19s45-19-01ol16">
       If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection 8, the partnership may tender a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection 3, stating the time of payment, the amount and type of security for payment, and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c45-19s45-19-01ol17">
       The payment or tender required by subsection 5 or 6 must be accompanied by the following:

         Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within one hundred twenty days after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection 3, or other terms of the obligation to purchase.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t45c45-19s45-19-01ol18">
       A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause undue hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment must be adequately secured and bear interest.
      </li>
      <li id="t45c45-19s45-19-01ol19">
       A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision b of subsection 2 of section 45-16-05, to determine the buyout price of that partner’s interest, any offsets under subsection 3, or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action must be commenced within one hundred twenty days after the partnership has tendered payment or an offer to pay or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner’s interest, any offset due under subsection 3, and accrued interest, and enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection 8, the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney’s fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership’s failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection 7.

        Buy-Out Agreement.

      </p>
      <p>
       Partnership buy-out agreements may be valid when the interest is priced at less than actual value; in that situation, however, the agreement must explicitly provide the price and terms. Bohn v. Bohn Implement Co., 325 N.W.2d 281, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 362</cite> (N.D. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the partnership agreement clearly and specifically states the price the surviving partners must pay for a deceased partner’s interest, the agreement will be upheld in the absence of fraud; however, if the partnership agreement is ambiguous on the matter, the surviving partners must pay the fair market value for the interest of the deceased partner. Bohn v. Bohn Implement Co., 325 N.W.2d 281, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 362</cite> (N.D. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       An intent to provide a buy-out price of less than fair market value will be upheld if that intent is explicitly stated in a written partnership agreement or, if the written agreement is ambiguous, if such an intent is proved by clear and convincing extrinsic evidence. Bohn v. Johnson, 371 N.W.2d 781, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 364</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Dissolution of the partnership by agreement of the partners or by court order are not the only ways to dissolve a partnership. Lonning v. Kurtz, 291 N.W.2d 438, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1980).

        Dissolution designates the point in time when the partners cease to carry on the business together; it is not synonymous with “winding up” or “termination” which are additional steps in completing the affairs and ending a partnership.

The partnership shall make a distribution to a partner in an amount equal to any excess of the credits over the charges in the partner’s account. A partner shall contribute to the partnership an amount equal to any excess of the charges over the credits in the partner’s account.

       If a partner fails to contribute, all of the other partners shall contribute, in the proportions in which those partners share partnership losses, the additional amount necessary to satisfy the partnership obligations. A partner or partner’s legal representative may recover from the other partners any contributions the partner makes to the extent the amount contributed exceeds that partner’s share of the partnership obligations.

       After the settlement of accounts, each partner shall contribute, in the proportion in which the partner shares partnership losses, the amount necessary to satisfy partnership obligations that were not known at the time of the settlement.

        Partners did not have a right to receive an in-kind distribution of the real property owned by the partnership upon winding up and dissolution, but only had a right to a cash payment of any surplus that was available after the partnership’s obligations to the creditors were satisfied.

   Bros.), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7198 (D.N.D. Apr. 22, 2004).

         Standing to Sue.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Limited liability partnership had standing to sue in an option contract case because, as of a September 19, 2012, order, the partnership’s registration had not been forfeited, nor had the North Dakota Secretary of State revoked its registration; moreover, a website status that listed it as “not good standing” was from significantly before the registration would have been forfeited. Even if the registration had been revoked, the partnership would have continued as a legal entity with the ability to sue and be sued. Guthmiller Farms, LLP v. Guthmiller, 2013 ND 248, 840 N.W.2d 636, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 2013).
