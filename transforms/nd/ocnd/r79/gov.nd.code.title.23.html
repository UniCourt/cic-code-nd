       Since this section clearly distinguishes between “information, data, reports, or records made available” to the committee, and the “proceedings and records of” the committee, the former being merely confidential, the latter being privileged, the legislature has expressed its intent that the two categories of information be treated differently by separating them in the statute.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state department of health shall employ and establish the qualifications, duties, and compensation of at least one full-time inspector for each commercial, nonpublicly owned waste management disposal or incineration facility that accepts more than twenty-five thousand tons [22679.5 kilograms] per year of hazardous waste, industrial waste, nuclear waste, or ash resulting from the incineration of municipal solid waste. This section does not apply to any energy conversion facility or coal mining operation that disposes of its solid waste onsite. The department may require inspectors for those facilities that accept less than twenty-five thousand tons [22679.5 kilograms] per year. The facility inspector shall conduct regular inspections of the operating procedure and conditions of the facility and report the findings to the department on a regular basis. If an inspector discovers a condition at a facility that is likely to cause imminent harm to the health and safety of the public or environment, the inspector shall notify the department. The department shall proceed as provided by sections 23-29-10 and 23-29-11.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department shall assess the owner or operator of a waste management facility that accepts hazardous waste, industrial waste, nuclear waste, or ash resulting from the incineration of municipal solid waste an annual fee to pay the salaries, wages, and operating expenses associated with employing an inspector for the facility. The owner or operator of the facility shall submit the fee to the department by July first of each year. Any fees collected must be deposited in the department’s operating fund in the state treasury and any expenditures from the fund are subject to appropriation by the legislative assembly. If a facility begins operation after July first of any year, the owner or operator of the facility shall pay to the department a prorated fee for the fiscal year before the facility may begin accepting waste. Moneys in the waste management facility account may be spent by the department within the limits of legislative appropriation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The department of health shall conduct a continuous program to review and improve the quality of health care in the state. The department may contract with a qualified person or organization to develop and implement the program. The department shall use the program to compile relevant information about the quality of health care in this state which will allow the department to evaluate the cost, quality, and outcomes of health care. The department shall establish and consult a provider advisory committee composed of health care providers regarding the data that is a cost-effective process for collecting and evaluating the information. The state health officer may assess against a provider a penalty of one hundred dollars per day for each day the provider willfully refuses to provide the department with information requested for use with the program, but the penalty may not exceed one thousand dollars for each request. A provider against whom a fee is assessed may appeal that assessment to the state health council. If the provider fails to pay the penalty, the health council may, in the county where the provider’s principal place of business is located, initiate a civil action against the provider to collect the penalty. As used in this section, “provider” means a person who is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized by the law of this state to administer health care in the ordinary course of business or professional practice. The department shall ensure that patient privacy is protected throughout the compilation and use of the information. The department shall evaluate data management capabilities in the state and shall organize its capabilities to provide information about the cost of care on an individual provider basis as well as a collective basis.

        Nonmedical Determination.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Insofar as a death certificate contained a nonmedical determination of the cause of death, e.g., “suicide” or “accident”, such determination was not a “fact” admissible under former N.D.C.C. § 23-02-40, which provided that a certified copy of a death certificate was prima facie proof of the facts stated therein. Abrahamson v. Amos, 245 N.W.2d 888, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Proof of Cause of Death.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under statute providing that a death certificate was prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated, a certificate filed by a county coroner who was a licensed practicing physician was admissible into evidence and could be included as one of the relevant factors as to proof showing cause of death. Brinkman v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 187 N.W.2d 657, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a workmen’s compensation case, where the cause of death as shown by a death certificate was uncontradicted by any other evidence, under the law the certificate was therefore prima facie evidence of the cause of death. Foss v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 214 N.W.2d 519, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1974).

       District court erred in denying a mother's motion to terminate the paternal grandmother's visitation with her minor child and to amend the child's birth certificate because the termination of the father's parental rights was a material change in circumstances and the grandmother did not establish a statutory basis for visitation where she had never met the child or had contact with her, and was no longer the child's legal grandparent, the mother was opposed to the grandmother having a relationship with the child, and the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to order the department of vital statistics to amend the child's birth certificate if it was in accordance with the governing statutes and regulations adopted thereunder.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t23c23-06s23-06-21.9ol11">
       The entity owning, conducting, or maintaining a cemetery may pass a resolution demanding that the owner of a portion of a cemetery which has been unused for more than sixty years express an interest in the cemetery plot. The entity shall personally serve a copy of its resolution on the owner in the same manner as personal service of process in a civil action. The resolution must notify the owner that the owner must, within sixty days after service of the resolution on the owner, express an interest in retaining the unused cemetery plot.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-06s23-06-21.9ol12">
       If the owner of the unused plot cannot personally be served with a copy of the resolution of the entity because the owner cannot be found in this state or for any other valid reason, the entity shall publish its resolution for three consecutive weeks in the official newspaper of the county where the cemetery is located and shall mail a copy of the resolution within fourteen days after the third publication to the owner’s last-known address.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-06s23-06-21.9ol13">
       If within sixty days after personal service or after publication of the board’s resolution is completed, the owner or person with a legal interest in the cemetery plot fails to express an interest in retaining the unused cemetery plot, the owner’s rights are terminated and title to that person’s plot reverts to the entity owning, conducting, or maintaining the cemetery.

       It is a conclusive presumption that an owner has abandoned a cemetery plot if for a period of more than sixty years the owner has not used any portion of the lot for purposes of burial and has not made provision for care of the lot beyond that provided uniformly to all lots within the cemetery and if the owner has failed to express an interest in retaining the cemetery plot after notice provided in this section.

A person is guilty of a class B misdemeanor who is required to make such report and willfully, as defined in section 12.1-02-02, fails to make the same. The requirements imposed in this subsection do not apply to any person engaged in the salvaging excavation or other disinterment of a human burial under authority of law.

       Any person having been found guilty or having pleaded guilty, as a result of having been charged with an offense under subsection 2 or 3, must be ordered to forfeit to the state any and all human remains and burial goods acquired in connection with the commission of the offense and may be ordered to forfeit to the state any and all equipment used in connection with the commission of the offense. In addition, any such person having been charged with an offense under subsection 3 must be ordered to pay all reasonable costs actually incurred in the reinterment of the human remains and burial goods so forfeited. In conjunction with the prosecution of any offense under this subsection, the remains in question in the prosecution may, as deemed necessary, be subjected to nonintrusive, nondestructive professional study for the exclusive purpose of determining whether the remains are human.

       Subsection 3 does not apply to the inadvertent disturbance of a human burial site, human remains, or burial goods when the department of health and human services and the state historical society have been notified of the disturbance and the human remains and burial goods must be studied and reinterred pursuant to rules adopted by the department of health and human services and the state historical society. Subsection 3 also does not apply to situations in which the department of health and human services and the state historical society are notified of the need to disinter and move the contents of human burial sites that are recorded with the state historical society to prevent the destruction of the human burial sites by actions including the construction of highways, dams, reservoirs, coal mines, power generation and transmission facilities, pipelines, farming practices, and other developments. Where feasible, the developments should avoid disturbance of the human burial sites. In these situations the disinterred human remains and burial goods must be studied and reinterred pursuant to rules adopted by the department of health and human services and the state historical society.

     <p>
      Every competent adult has the right and responsibility to make the decisions relating to the adult’s own health care, including the decision to have health care provided, withheld, or withdrawn. The purpose of this chapter is to enable adults to retain control over their own health care during periods of incapacity through health directives and the designation of an individual to make health care decisions on their behalf. This chapter does not condone, authorize, or approve mercy killing, or permit an affirmative or deliberate act or omission to end life, other than to allow the natural process of dying.

       A principal may execute a health care directive. A health care directive may include one or more health care instructions to health care providers, others assisting with health care, family members, and a health care agent. A health care directive may include a power of attorney to appoint an agent to make health care decisions for the principal when the principal lacks the capacity to make health care decisions, unless otherwise specified in the health care directive. Subject to the provisions of this chapter and any express limitations set forth by the principal in the health care directive, the agent has the authority to make any and all health care decisions on the principal’s behalf that the principal could make.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-06.5s23-06.5-03ol12">
       After consultation with the attending physician and other health care providers, the agent shall make health care decisions:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t23c23-06.5s23-06.5-03ol12a">
         In accordance with the agent’s knowledge of the principal’s wishes and religious or moral beliefs, as stated orally, or as contained in the principal’s health care directive; or

      <li id="t23c23-06.5s23-06.5-03ol14">
       Notwithstanding subsection 3, the principal may authorize in a health care directive that the agent make health care decisions for the principal even though the principal retains capacity to make health care decisions. In that case, the health care directive is in effect as stated in the health care directive under any conditions the principal may impose. The principal’s authorization under this subsection may be revoked in the same manner as a health care directive may be revoked under section 23-06.5-07.

        Plaintiff who sought to execute a living will and durable power of attorney which would have the same effect whether or not she was pregnant, and her husband, who sought to be able to serve as her agent under this act and consent to an abortion without court approval, did not have standing to claim that the pregnancy and abortion provisions of the Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act and this act were unconstitutional, nor were their claims ripe, where plaintiff was neither pregnant nor incompetent, did not wish to become pregnant, and was in good health; there was no “realistic danger” that the statutes would directly injure the plaintiffs.

       Upon request of a procurement organization, a coroner or medical examiner shall release to the procurement organization the name, contact information, and available medical and social history of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner. If the decedent’s body or part is medically suitable for transplantation, therapy, research, or education, the coroner or medical examiner shall release post-mortem examination results to the procurement organization. The procurement organization may make a subsequent disclosure of the post-mortem examination results or other information received from the coroner or medical examiner only if relevant to transplantation or therapy.

       The coroner or medical examiner may conduct a medicolegal examination by reviewing all medical records, laboratory test results, x-rays, other diagnostic results, and other information that any person possesses about a donor or prospective donor whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner which the coroner or medical examiner determines may be relevant to the investigation.

       A person that has any information requested by a coroner or medical examiner pursuant to subsection 2 shall provide that information as expeditiously as possible to allow the coroner or medical examiner to conduct the medicolegal investigation within a period compatible with the preservation of parts for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.

       If an anatomical gift has been or might be made of a part of a decedent whose body is under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner and a post-mortem examination is not required, or the coroner or medical examiner determines that a post-mortem examination is required but that the recovery of the part that is the subject of an anatomical gift will not interfere with the examination, the coroner or medical examiner and procurement organization shall cooperate in the timely removal of the part from the decedent for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education.

       If an anatomical gift of a part from the decedent under the jurisdiction of the coroner or medical examiner has been or might be made, but the coroner or medical examiner initially believes that the recovery of the part could interfere with the post-mortem investigation into the decedent’s cause or manner of death, the coroner or medical examiner shall consult with the procurement organization or physician or technician designated by the procurement organization about the proposed recovery. The procurement organization shall provide the coroner or medical examiner with all information the organization has which could relate to the cause or manner of the decedent’s death. After consultation, the coroner or medical examiner may allow the recovery.

       Following the consultation under subsection 5, in the absence of mutually agreed-upon protocols to resolve conflict between the coroner or medical examiner and the procurement organization, if the coroner or medical examiner intends to deny recovery of an organ for transplantation, the coroner or medical examiner or designee of the coroner or medical examiner, at the request of the procurement organization, shall attend the removal procedure for the part before making a final determination not to allow the procurement organization to recover the part. During the removal procedure, the coroner or medical examiner or designee of the coroner or medical examiner may allow recovery by the procurement organization to proceed, or, if the coroner or medical examiner or designee of the coroner or medical examiner reasonably believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent’s cause or manner of death, deny recovery by the procurement organization.

      Care and treatment provided by the state of North Dakota for persons suffering from tuberculosis, including diagnosis, tests, studies, and analyses for the discovery of tuberculosis, must be available without cost or charge to anyone who is suffering from tuberculosis or is suspected of having tuberculosis. Any such person who volunteers to assume and pay for the cost of such care and treatment or for the cost of such diagnosis, test, studies, or analyses must be permitted to do so; but no state, county, or other public official may request or require such payment or make or cause to be made any inquiry or investigation for the purpose of determining the ability of such person or of the person’s legally responsible relatives to pay therefor. This section in no way bars freedom of the individual to seek treatment from a physician or in an institution of the individual’s choice at the individual’s own expense.

      Nothing in this chapter requires the admission of an enrolled Indian, resident on any reservation in this state, to any off-reservation institution except upon written request and authorization of the superintendent of the reservation on which said Indian is enrolled. However, in the public interest and with the objective of eradication of tuberculosis in the state of North Dakota, an Indian with tuberculosis off any reservation is subject to this chapter. It is the responsibility of the Indian affairs commission pursuant to the commission’s powers and duties, stated in section 54-36-03, to work closely with the tribal councils and other reservation officials to adopt any agreements found necessary in assisting the state health officer in carrying out responsibilities under this chapter so that all residents of this state will benefit, and eradication of tuberculosis in North Dakota can be achieved.

    Public health procedures for persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection. [Effective through August 31, 2022]

     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to this chapter, the state health officer or a designee of the state health officer may examine or cause to be examined a person reasonably believed to be infected with or to have been exposed to the human immunodeficiency virus.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t23c23-07.4s23-07.4-01ol11">
       Orders or restrictive measures directed to a person with human immunodeficiency virus infection must be used as the last resort when other measures to protect the public health have failed, including all reasonable efforts, which must be documented, to obtain the voluntary cooperation of the person who may be subject to the order or measure. The orders and measures must be applied serially with the least intrusive measures used first. The burden of proof is on the state health officer or a designee of the state health officer to show that specified grounds exist for the issuance of the orders or restrictive measures and that the terms and conditions imposed are no more restrictive than necessary to protect the public health.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.4s23-07.4-01ol12">
       When the state health officer or a designee of the state health officer knows or has reason to believe, because of medical or epidemiological information, that a person within that official’s jurisdiction has human immunodeficiency virus infection and is a danger to the public health, that official may issue an order, according to the following priority, to:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t23c23-07.4s23-07.4-01ol12a">
         Require the person to be examined and tested to determine whether the person has human immunodeficiency virus infection;
        </li>
        <li id="t23c23-07.4s23-07.4-01ol12b">
         Require a person with human immunodeficiency virus infection to report to a qualified physician or health worker for counseling on the disease and for information on how to avoid infecting others; or
        </li>
        <li id="t23c23-07.4s23-07.4-01ol12c">
         Direct a person with human immunodeficiency virus infection to cease and desist from specified conduct that endangers the health of others, but only if that official has determined that clear and convincing evidence exists to believe that the person has been ordered to report for counseling as provided in subdivision b and continues to demonstrate behavior that endangers the health of others.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.4s23-07.4-01ol13">
       If a person violates an order issued under subdivision c of subsection 2 and it is shown that the person is a danger to others, the state health officer or a designee of the state health officer may enforce the order by imposing such restrictions upon the person as are necessary to prevent the specific conduct that endangers the health of others. Restrictions must be in writing, setting forth the name of the person to be restricted and the initial period of time, not to exceed ninety days, during which the order remains effective, the terms of the restrictions, and any other conditions as may be necessary to protect the public health. Restrictions must be imposed in the least restrictive manner necessary to protect the public health.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.4s23-07.4-01ol14">
       Upon issuance of any order under subsection 2 or 3, the state health officer or a designee of the state health officer shall promptly, personally, and confidentially notify the person who is the subject of the order, stating the grounds and provisions of the order and the right to contest the order, the right to be present at a judicial hearing in the district court serving the county in which the person resides to review the order, and the right to be represented by counsel during the hearing. If the person who is the subject of the order refuses to comply with the order and refuses to cooperate voluntarily with the state health officer or a designee of the state health officer, the state health officer or designee may petition the district court serving the county in which the person resides for an order of compliance. The state health officer or designee shall request the state’s attorney in the county in which the person resides to file the petition in the district court. If an order of compliance is requested, the court shall hear the matter within ten days after the request. Notice of the place, date, and time of the court hearing must be made by personal service or, if the person is not available, must be mailed to the person who is the subject of the order by certified mail at the person’s last-known address. Proof of mailing by the state health officer or designee is sufficient notice under this section. The burden of proof is on the state health officer or designee to show by clear and convincing evidence that the specified grounds exist for the issuance of the order and for the need for compliance and that the terms and conditions imposed in the order are no more restrictive than necessary to protect the public health. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the court shall issue appropriate orders affirming, modifying, or dismissing the order. If the court dismisses the order, the fact that the order was issued must be expunged from the records of the state department of health. If the court affirms or modifies the order and the person subject to the order is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, the court shall require the person to disclose the names and addresses, if known, of persons with whom the person has had contact that poses an epidemiologically demonstrated risk of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. Failure to comply with court-ordered disclosure constitutes contempt of court.

The person who is the subject of the order must be given prompt, personal, and confidential notice of the order stating the grounds and provisions of the order and notifying the person of the right to contest the order, the right to be present at a judicial hearing in the district court serving the county in which the person resides to review the order, and the right to be represented by counsel during the hearing. If the person contests testing or treatment, no invasive medical procedures may be carried out before a hearing is held under subsection 3.

       “Bloodborne pathogen” means a micro-organism that is present in human blood or in other bodily fluid or tissue which can cause a disease in humans, including the hepatitis B virus, the hepatitis C virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus, and for which testing is recommended by the United States public health service.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-01ol12">
       “Exposed individual” means an individual, including a patient, health care provider, firefighter, peace officer, correctional officer, court officer, law enforcement officer, emergency medical technician, laboratory personnel, or an individual trained and authorized by law or rule to render emergency medical assistance or treatment, including an individual rendering aid under chapter 32-03.1, who is exposed to a bloodborne pathogen.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-01ol13">
       “Exposure” means a percutaneous injury, including a needle stick or cut with a sharp object; contact with blood, bodily fluid, or tissue of a mucous membrane or nonintact skin, including exposed skin that is chapped, abraded, or afflicted with dermatitis; or contact with other bodily fluids that are potentially infectious as determined under guidelines of the United States public health service.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-01ol14">
       “Health care” means any services included in the furnishing to an individual of hospitalization, or medical or dental care, or any services incident to the furnishing of that care or hospitalization, as well as the furnishing to an individual of any other services for the purpose of preventing, alleviating, curing, or healing human illness or injury.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-01ol15">

       Except when testing is otherwise permitted by law, a health care provider, blood bank, blood center, or plasma center may not subject an individual who is the source of an exposure to a test for bloodborne pathogens unless the subject of the test or the subject’s personal representative if the subject is a minor or is incapacitated first provides informed consent for testing.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-02ol12">
       If an individual who is the source of an exposure has had blood drawn that is available for testing and the individual has refused to grant consent to have that individual’s blood tested for bloodborne pathogens, that individual’s blood may be subjected to a test for the presence of bloodborne pathogens, without that individual’s consent, if a physician or other qualified health care provider based on available information determines and certifies in writing that the individual had an exposure and before testing the test subject is informed that the test subject’s blood may be tested for the presence of bloodborne pathogens; that the test results may not be disclosed without the test subject’s authorization, except to the exposed individual, the individual’s health care provider, and any other person as authorized by law; that if the exposed individual knows the identity of the test subject, the exposed individual may not disclose the identity of the test subject except for the purpose of having the test performed; and that a record of the test results may be kept in the exposed individual’s medical record only if the record does not reveal the test subject’s identity. Each exposed individual who had an exposure and to whom test results are disclosed must first be given a document indicating the exposed individual’s understanding that the exposed individual may not disclose the test subject’s identity and that disclosing this information constitutes a class C felony.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-02ol13">
       If an individual who is the subject of an exposure is incapable of giving informed consent for testing under this section, that consent may be obtained from the individual’s personal representative. If an individual who is the subject of an exposure dies without an opportunity to consent to testing, collection of appropriate specimens and testing for the presence of bloodborne pathogens must be conducted as soon as reasonably possible. Results of these tests must be provided to the physician providing care for the individual who experienced the exposure. If a facility that received the individual who died fails to test for the presence of bloodborne pathogens as required under this subsection because the facility was not aware of the exposure or it was not reasonably possible to conduct testing, the facility shall provide the physician providing care for the exposed individual or health care provider testing results of any bloodborne pathogen present in any medical records of the deceased individual which are in the facility’s control as soon as reasonably possible. If there are no testing results for bloodborne pathogens within that facility and there is reason to believe that results are available from another facility, the facility that received the deceased individual shall attempt to obtain testing results of bloodborne pathogens of the deceased individual as soon as reasonably possible from the facility where it is believed results exist. The test results must be provided to the physician providing care for the individual who experienced the exposure.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-02ol14">
       A test for bloodborne pathogens must be conducted according to recommendations of the United States public health service. Any testing done pursuant to subsection 2 or 3 must be conducted in a reasonably expedient manner. The district court in the county where the alleged exposure occurred or in which the individual to be tested resides shall issue an order directing the individual who was the source of an exposure to have blood drawn to be tested for bloodborne pathogens. An affidavit from a physician or other qualified health care provider showing that an exposure has occurred is prima facie evidence of those facts. The affidavit may not be excluded as hearsay if the affidavit is based on evidence generally relied on by a health care provider, including statements from the provider’s patient. The record of any court hearing conducted under this subsection is confidential. The court shall issue an order requiring testing under this subsection if:

        <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-02ol14a">
         The court finds probable cause to believe that the individual petitioning for the testing had an exposure with the test subject;

         The court provides the test subject with notice and reasonable opportunity to participate in the proceeding if the person is not already a party to the proceeding;

      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-02ol15">
       If the court issues an order for testing, the court may order the confinement of the test subject until blood is drawn for testing or issue an order establishing reasonable security for the individual’s attendance at the test site. This order may be modified or extended.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-02ol16">
       A health care provider who subjects an individual to an exposure must notify the individual of the exposure. A health care provider witnessing an exposure may report the exposure pursuant to any appropriate facility or employer guidelines to which the provider may be subject. The knowing failure to inform an individual of an exposure or refusal to submit to testing as required under this chapter may be considered by a health care provider’s licensing board to constitute conduct that may subject the licensee to disciplinary action.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-07.5s23-07.5-02ol17">
       The exposed individual shall pay the expense of testing. However, if the exposure occurs at an employee’s workplace, the worker’s employer shall pay the expense of testing unless otherwise provided by subdivision b of subsection 11 of section 65-01-02. If the individual to be tested is convicted of a crime relating to the exposure or the exposure occurred during an arrest or other contact with the exposed individual in the course of that individual’s official duties, a court may order the individual to be tested to pay for the testing.

    Court hearing.

     <p>
      A hearing must be held on a petition filed under subsection 2 of section 23-07.6-03 within five days of filing the petition. For a good cause shown, the court may continue the hearing for up to ten days. A respondent has the right to a court hearing in the district court serving the county in which the respondent resides. A record of the proceedings pursuant to this section must be made and retained. If parties cannot personally appear before the court due to risks of contamination or the spread of disease, proceedings may be conducted by their authorized representatives and be held via any means that allows all parties to fully participate. The respondent has a right to counsel and if the respondent is indigent, the respondent has the right to have counsel provided at public expense. The respondent, respondent’s representative, or respondent’s counsel has the right to cross-examine witnesses testifying at the hearing. A petition for a hearing does not stay a written directive ordering confinement. The court shall determine by a preponderance of the evidence if the respondent is infected with a communicable disease, if the respondent poses a substantial threat to the public health, and if confinement is necessary and is the least restrictive alternative to protect or preserve the public health. The court shall also determine whether to order the respondent to follow the state or local health officer’s directive for decontamination, treatment, or preventative measures if the petition is granted. If the written directive was issued by a local health officer, the state health officer has the right to be made a party to the proceedings.

       The court may order any defendant charged with a sex offense under chapter 12.1-20 and any alleged juvenile offender with respect to whom a petition has been filed in a juvenile court alleging violation of chapter 12.1-20 to undergo medical testing to determine whether the defendant or alleged juvenile offender has any sexually transmitted diseases, including a test for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus or any other identified positive agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The court may not order a defendant charged with violating section 12.1-20-12.1 or 12.1-20-13 or an alleged juvenile offender with respect to when a petition has been filed in a juvenile court alleging violation of section 12.1-20-12.1 or 12.1-20-13 to undergo the testing authorized by this section. The court may order the testing only if the court receives a petition from the alleged victim of the offense or from the prosecuting attorney if the alleged victim has made a written request to the prosecuting attorney to petition the court for an order authorized under this section. On receipt of a petition, the court shall determine, without a hearing, if probable cause exists to believe that a possible transfer of a sexually transmitted disease or human immunodeficiency virus took place between the defendant or alleged juvenile offender and the alleged victim. If the court determines probable cause exists, the court shall order the defendant or alleged juvenile offender to submit to testing and that a copy of the test results be released to the defendant’s or alleged juvenile offender’s physician and each requesting victim’s physician.

       <b>
        LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
       </b>
       Because facilities are not always available for the preparation of food onsite by nonprofit public-spirited organizations not regularly engaged in the business of selling food or to persons not regularly engaged in the business of preparing or selling food and who prepare food for sale directly to the ultimate consumer at a farmers’ market, bake sale, or similar enterprise, it is the intent of the legislative assembly to exempt organizations and persons in those situations from preparing food in licensed or approved kitchens. Because the unintentional mishandling of food may jeopardize the public health and welfare, whether the mishandling is done by an establishment open to public patronage or by a nonprofit public-spirited organization or a person providing a limited type of food service, it is the intent of the legislative assembly to authorize the department of health and consolidated laboratories to offer educational support to food preparers.”

      If the owner of a mobile home park applies for the rezoning of a park, the owner shall post a notice of the proposed rezoning in the park at least five days before the public hearing on the rezoning. In addition, the owner of a mobile home park shall notify all tenants in that park in writing of a change in use at least one hundred eighty days before the change in use. A change in use is a change in the park that would alter any portion of the park which is used to lease to mobile home owners so that the portion will no longer be leased to mobile home owners. The owner or manager may not increase rent within ninety days before giving notice of a change in use for the portion of the park to which the change will apply.

    Creation of housing authorities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In each city and in each county of the state, there is created a public body corporate and politic to be known as the “housing authority” of the city or county, as the case may be. Such authority may not transact any business nor exercise any powers granted by this chapter until the governing body of the city or of the county, as the case may be, by proper resolution, declares that there is need for an authority to function in such city or county. The determination as to whether there is such need may be made by the governing body on its own motion and must be made upon filing of a petition signed by twenty-five residents of the city or county, as the case may be, asserting that there is need for such authority to function in such city or county and requesting that the governing body so declare.

        Burleigh County, North Dakota, Housing Authority (BCHA) is a public corporation and is not an administrative unit of the executive branch of state government; the Administrative Agencies Practices Act does not apply to or provide for judicial review of the BCHA’s actions. Therefore, a district court lacked jurisdiction to deny a resident’s request for review of the termination of housing assistance benefits. Brown v. Burleigh County Hous.

Upon the adoption of such a resolution the city authority shall cease to exist, except for the purpose of winding up its affairs and executing a deed to the county housing authority pursuant to the agreement executed between the city and the county under the provisions of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.54.html#t54c54-40s54-40-08" target="_blank">54-40-08</a></cite>. All the rights, contracts, obligations, and property, real and personal, of the city authority must be transferred to and become vested in the county authority, provided that all bonded indebtedness issued by the city authority remains a lien against the income and revenues of the housing project pledged to the payment of such bonds. All rights and remedies of any person against the city authority may be asserted and enforced against the county authority to the same extent as they might have been against the city authority.

      The property of an authority used for low-income housing, authority administration, or other property solely owned by the authority and used to conduct the powers granted to the authority in this chapter, including an authority created under Indian laws recognized by the federal government, is declared to be public property used for essential public and governmental purposes and is exempt from all taxes and special assessments of the state or any political subdivision. In lieu of taxes or special assessments, an authority may agree to make payments to the state or any political subdivision for improvements, services, and facilities furnished by the state or political subdivision for the benefits of a housing project. The payments may not exceed the estimated cost of the improvements, services, or facilities to be so furnished. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the property of an authority used for moderate income housing is exempt from all taxes of the state or any political subdivision except special assessments unless specifically exempted from the special assessment by the political subdivision.

      Any housing authority may undertake the development and administration of projects to assure the availability of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons engaged in national defense activities who, as determined by the housing authority, would not otherwise be able to secure safe and sanitary dwellings within the vicinity thereof. In the ownership, development, or administration of such projects, a housing authority has all the rights, powers, privileges, and immunities that such authority has under any provisions of law relating to the ownership, development, or administration of slum clearance and housing projects for persons of low income. The authority shall exercise such rights, powers, and privileges as though all the provisions of law applicable to slum clearance and housing projects for persons of low income were applicable to projects developed or administered to assure the availability of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons engaged in national defense activities as provided in this section. Housing projects developed or administered hereunder constitute housing projects under the provisions of this chapter. When a housing authority finds that within its area of operation, or any part thereof, there is an acute shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings which impedes the national defense program or the general welfare of veterans and that necessary and safe and sanitary dwellings would not otherwise be provided when needed for such persons, any project developed or administered by such housing authority or by any housing authority cooperating with such authority pursuant to this section, with the financial aid of the federal government or as agent for the federal government as hereinafter provided, is not subject to the limitations provided in sections 23-11-13 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t23c23-11s23-11-14" target="_self">23-11-14</a></cite>. Any such finding must be conclusive in any suit, action, or other proceeding. A housing authority may make payments in such amounts as it finds necessary or desirable for any services, facilities, works, privileges, or improvements furnished for or in connection with any such projects. After the national defense period any such projects owned and administered by a housing authority must be administered in accordance with the preceding sections of this chapter except veterans are not subject to the limitations in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t23c23-11s23-11-14" target="_self">23-11-14</a></cite>.

      This chapter constitutes an independent authorization for a housing authority to undertake the development or administration of projects to assure the availability of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons engaged in national defense activities and for veterans as provided in this chapter and for a housing authority to cooperate with, or act as agent for, the federal government in the development or administration of similar projects by the federal government. In acting under this authorization, a housing authority is not subject to any limitations, restrictions, or requirements of other laws, except those relating to land acquisition, prescribing the procedure or action to be taken in the development or administration of any public works, including slum clearance and housing projects for such persons or undertakings or projects of municipal or public corporations or political subdivisions or agencies of the state. A housing authority may do any and all things necessary or desirable to cooperate with, or act as agent for, the federal government, or to secure financial aid, in the expeditious development or in the administration of projects to assure the availability of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons engaged in national defense activities and for veterans and to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

     <p>
      This chapter does not prohibit supervised public displays of fireworks by cities, fair associations, amusement parks, and other organizations. Except when such display is given by a municipality or fair association within its own limits, no display may be given unless a permit therefor has first been secured. Every application for such a permit must be made in writing to the city auditor at least fifteen days in advance of the date of the display. The application promptly must be referred to the governing body of the city which shall make an investigation to determine whether the operator of the display is competent and whether the display is of such character and is to be so located, discharged, or fired that it will not be hazardous to property or endanger any person. Such governing body shall report the results of this investigation to the city auditor and if it reports that in its opinion the operator is competent and that the display as planned will conform to safety requirements, including the rules and regulations of the state fire marshal hereinafter provided for, such auditor shall issue a permit for the display when the applicant pays a permit fee of two dollars. When the supervised public display for which a permit is sought is to be held outside the limits of an incorporated municipality, the application must be made to the county auditor and the duties imposed by this chapter upon the city auditor must be performed in such case by the county auditor. The duties imposed on the governing body of the city by this chapter must be performed in such case by the board of county commissioners. After such permit has been granted, sales, possession, use, and distribution of fireworks for such display are lawful for that purpose only. No permit granted hereunder is transferable. The state fire marshal shall adopt reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter to ensure that fireworks displays are given safely.

      No hospital, physician, nurse, hospital employee, nor any other person is under any duty, by law or contract, nor may such hospital or person in any circumstances be required to participate in the performance of an abortion, if such hospital or person objects to such abortion. No such person or institution may be discriminated against because the person or institution so objects. For purposes of this section, “abortion” means the act of using or prescribing any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other substance, device, or means with the intent to terminate the clinically diagnosable intrauterine pregnancy of a woman, including the elimination of one or more unborn children in a multifetal pregnancy, with knowledge that the termination by those means will with reasonable likelihood cause the death of the unborn child. Such use, prescription, or means is not an abortion if done with the intent to save the life or preserve the health of the unborn child; remove a dead unborn child caused by spontaneous abortion; or treat a woman for an ectopic pregnancy.

     <p>
      If the department has revoked the license of a health care facility, or if the operator of a health care facility has requested, the department may file a petition with the district court to place the health care facility under the control of a receiver if necessary to protect the health or safety of patients or residents at the health care facility. The court may grant the petition upon a finding that the health or safety of the patients or residents at the health care facility would be seriously threatened if a condition existing at the time the petition was filed is permitted to continue. This finding may be based upon evidence concerning the physical plant or the program and services offered by the health care facility, but not solely upon evidence that a health care facility has been denied a license to operate as a health care facility or has had a previously issued license revoked.

     <p>
      If the department determines a situation exists which constitutes an imminent threat to health or safety of the residents of a nursing facility, the department may take immediate control of the nursing facility and appoint an interim administrator. Within ten days of taking control of a nursing facility, the department shall petition the district court of the district in which the nursing facility is located to establish a receivership. The court shall grant the petition if it finds the department is substantially justified in concluding there was an imminent threat to life or health of the residents. In making its decision the court shall consider the matters set forth in section 23-16.1-02, any matters that the department considered in reaching its decision, and any other matters bearing on the ability of the nursing facility to provide for the health or safety of its residents. If the court grants the petition, the court shall also reconfirm the appointment of the interim administrator or direct the state health officer to choose another pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t23c23-16.1s23-16.1-03" target="_self">23-16.1-03</a></cite>. Any receiver reconfirmed or appointed pursuant to this section shall comply with sections 23-16.1-03 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t23c23-16.1s23-16.1-05" target="_self">23-16.1-05</a></cite>. Neither the department nor the court may terminate the appointment of a receiver appointed under this section until the nursing facility has complied with federal and state law and demonstrated management capability to ensure continued compliance and the health and safety of the residents.
     </p>
     <p>
      As used in this section, an “imminent threat to health or safety” means without intervention one or more of the following will occur to the residents: death, loss of mobility, partial disability, loss of motor skills, loss of speech, hearing, sight, or other ability to function within normal limits for an individual of that age and condition.

      The court shall appoint as receiver the state health officer who shall designate a qualified individual, not employed by this state or its political subdivisions, or a nonprofit organization to execute the receivership.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The state chiropractic board of examiners is hereby authorized to issue licenses to operate chiropractic hospitals and sanatoriums or other related institutions as herein defined, which, after inspection are to comply with the provisions of this chapter, and any regulations adopted by said state board of examiners. All decisions of this board may be reviewed in the district court in the county in which such institution is located or contemplated. The state board of chiropractic examiners is hereby authorized to suspend or revoke a license issued hereunder, on any of the following grounds:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t23c23-17s23-17-06ol11">
       Violation of any of the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17s23-17-06ol12">
       Permitting, aiding, or abetting the commission of any illegal act in such institution.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17s23-17-06ol13">
       Conduct or practices detrimental to the welfare of the patient of said institution.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Provided that before any such license issued hereunder is suspended or revoked, thirty days’ written notice must be given the holder thereof of the date set for hearing of the complaint. The holder of such license must be furnished with a copy of said complaint and is entitled to be represented by legal counsel at such hearing. Such notice must be given by the state board of chiropractic examiners by registered or certified mail. If a license is revoked as herein provided, a new application for license may be considered by the state chiropractic board of examiners when, and after, the conditions upon which revocation was based have been corrected and evidence of this fact has been satisfactorily furnished. A new license may then be granted after proper inspection has been made and all provisions of this chapter and rules and regulations hereunder as heretofore and hereinafter provided have been complied with.

    Basic requirements for hospice program.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A hospice program must comply with the following basic standards:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol11">
       The hospice program’s services must include physician services, nursing services, medical social services, counseling, and volunteer services. The services must be coordinated with those of the hospice patient’s primary or attending physician.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol12">
       The hospice program must coordinate its services with professional and nonprofessional services already in the community. The hospice program may contract for elements of its services; however, direct patient contact and overall coordination of hospice services must be maintained by the hospice care team. Any contract entered into between a hospice program and a health care facility or service provider must specify that the hospice program retains the responsibility for planning and coordinating hospice services and care on behalf of a hospice patient and the hospice patient’s family. No hospice which contracts for any hospice service may charge fees for services provided directly by the hospice care team which duplicate contractual services provided to the individual hospice patient or family.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol13">
       The hospice care team is responsible for the coordination of home and inpatient care.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol14">
       The hospice program must have a medical director who is a physician licensed pursuant to chapter 43-17. The medical director has overall responsibility for medical policy in relation to the care and treatment of hospice patients and their families rendered by the hospice care team and must consult and cooperate with the hospice patient’s attending physician.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol15">
       The hospice program must provide the services of a registered nurse, as defined under chapter 43-12.1, to supervise and coordinate the palliative and supportive care for patients and families provided by the hospice care team.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol16">
       The hospice program must identify a member of the hospice team who will be responsible for providing for coordination and administration of the hospice service plan for patients and families.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol17">
       The hospice program must have a bereavement program to provide a continuum of supportive services for the family.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol18">
       The hospice program must foster independence of the hospice patient and the hospice patient’s family by providing training, encouragement, and support so that the patient and family can care for themselves as much as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol19">
       The hospice program may not impose the dictates of any value or belief system on hospice patients or their families.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol110">
       The hospice program must clearly define admission criteria. Decisions on admission must be made by a hospice care team and are dependent upon the expressed request of the patient; however, if the attending physician certifies that the patient is unable to request admission, a family member may voluntarily request and receive admission of the patient and family on the patient’s behalf. Any request for admission must include written evidence of informed consent signed by the person making the request, which contains an explanation, in plain language of the nature and limitations of hospice care.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol111">
       The hospice program must keep accurate, current, and confidential records on all hospice patients and their families. Upon reasonable notice, the records must be made available to duly authorized officers or employees of the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c23-17.4s23-17.4-07ol112">

If such persons who own, hold, or have a right of interment in any plot of the cemetery or part affected are unknown or cannot be located, the publication of the notice of declaration of intent to disinter provided for in section 23-21-06 must be deemed to be proper and sufficient notice to such persons.

If the person desiring to cause the removal is not an heir at law of the person whose remains the person desires to remove, the removal may not be made by that person until that person has delivered to the cemetery authority the written consent of a majority of the known heirs at law of the decedent who are residents of this state. The statements in the affidavit are sufficient evidence of the number, names, and residences of the heirs at law for all of the purposes of this chapter, and the written consent of the majority of the heirs at law named in the affidavit is sufficient authority for the cemetery authority to permit the removal of the remains.

The order must be obtained upon petition of the cemetery corporation, limited liability company, or association, after such notice by publication as the court may direct, and any member or former plot owner may support or oppose the granting of the order by affidavit or otherwise. Before making the order, proof must be made to the satisfaction of the court that notice has been given and that it is for the best interest of the cemetery corporation, limited liability company, or association that the transfer be made.

      When an order of the council creating a vector control district has been filed in the office of the county auditor of a county in which the district or a part of the district is situated, a three-member board of commissioners of the vector control district must be appointed as provided by this section. Any resident freeholder in the district is eligible for appointment to the board of commissioners thereof. The term of commissioners first appointed must be determined by lot. One commissioner shall hold office for a term of two years, one shall serve for a term of three years, and one shall serve for a term of five years. The term of a commissioner commences on the date of appointment. If the office of a commissioner becomes vacant, the commissioner appointed to fill the vacancy shall serve the unexpired term of the member of the board of commissioners whom the new commissioner replaces. Any vacancy must be filled in the manner provided for original appointments. Appointments to the board of commissioners must be made by the board of county commissioners of the county containing the largest area of the vector control district. Any member of the board of commissioners may be removed upon a majority vote of the board of county commissioners that appoints members for the board of commissioners and the board of commissioners may be dissolved upon a majority vote of the board of county commissioners that appoints the members for the board. The appointing authority shall establish the rate of compensation for commissioners and actual expenses incurred by commissioners may be reimbursed at the official reimbursement rates of the appointing authority.

    Vector control district budget — Financial report — Tax levy by county.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a vector control district has been created and a board of commissioners has been organized, the board shall estimate the expenses of the district from the date of its establishment until the end of the ensuing fiscal year and before July first in each year and thereafter shall estimate district expenses for the fiscal year ensuing. Estimates of district expenses may include all outlays necessary to carry out the powers of the board herein provided for. Upon adoption of a budget, the board of commissioners shall send a copy of such budget to the county auditor of each county in the district. If a district is situated in more than one county, the estimate must be apportioned to the counties affected. Such county auditor shall transmit the same to the board of commissioners of the auditor’s county. In the year for which the levy is sought, a vector control district seeking approval of a property tax levy under this chapter must file with the county auditor of each county within the vector control district, at a time and in a format prescribed by the county auditors, a financial report for the preceding calendar year showing the ending balances of each fund held by the vector control district during that year. The board of county commissioners of each county in which the district is situated may by resolution levy, authorize, and direct their county auditor to extend and spread upon the tax roll of the county a tax not exceeding the limitation in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-15s57-15-26" target="_blank">57-15-26</a></cite>.2. Funds produced each year by such tax levy must be available until expended and if such tax levy in any year will not produce sufficient revenue to cover district expenses a fund sufficient to pay the same may be accumulated.

    District may issue warrants in anticipation of taxes levied to pay current expenses.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      After a vector control district has been established and a board of commissioners has been appointed and organized, the board of commissioners may, in order to pay current district expenses including per diem compensation and expenses of commissioners and wages and salaries of officers or employees, by resolution authorize and issue district warrants in anticipation of impending collection and receipt of taxes levied. The warrants must bear such rate of interest as the board may determine, not to exceed twelve percent per annum. There is no interest rate ceiling on warrant issues sold to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The district treasurer shall keep a register in which to enter each warrant issued showing the date and amount of each warrant, the date of payment, and the amount paid in redemption thereof. All warrants must be paid in order of their presentation for payment to the district treasurer. The warrants must be drawn to the claimant or bearer in the same manner as a county warrant and must be signed by the chairman of the board of commissioners and countersigned by the treasurer of the district. The total amount of warrants issued in any year to pay current district expenses may not exceed eighty percent of the district’s tax levy for such year.

     <p>
      Voter-approved levy authority under this section or section 23-18-01 authorized by electors of a county before January 1, 2015, remains in effect through taxable year 2024 or for the time period authorized by the electors, whichever expires first.

       The proceedings for the annexation, referred to in subsection 1, may be initiated by the presentation to the county auditor of a petition signed by thirty percent or more of the qualified electors who are owners of any interest in real property assessed for taxation in the territory to be annexed and who are residing within the boundaries of such territory stating the desires and purposes of such petitioners. The petition must contain a description of the boundaries of the territory proposed to be annexed. It must be accompanied by a map or plat and a deposit for publication costs.

If at least sixty percent of the qualified electors voting in the election within the territory proposed to be annexed approve, the territory becomes a part of the existing hospital district.

If the owner or occupant fails to comply with the notice to remove or abate or if the nuisance, source of filth, or cause of sickness exists on property of nonresident owners or on property the owners of which cannot be found, the board of health may remove or destroy the nuisance, source of filth, or cause of sickness at the expense of the appropriate city or county, which shall charge the expense against the lot, piece, or parcel of land on which the work is done.

The auditor shall publish, in the same manner as provided under section 40-22-06, the amount of the assessment together with a notice of the time and location the governing body will meet to consider the approval of the assessment. Each assessment must be recorded, collected, and paid as other taxes are recorded, collected, and paid.

       If a board of health determines it necessary for the preservation of public health to enter any building within the board’s jurisdiction to examine, destroy, remove, or prevent any nuisance, source of filth, or cause of sickness and is refused entrance into the building, the local health officer, or a designated agent of the local health officer, may make a complaint under oath to a district judge within the jurisdiction of the board of health stating the facts in the case which the local health officer, or a designated agent of the local health officer, has knowledge. If a warrant is issued and if requested by a board of health, a county sheriff or city police department shall provide assistance to that public health unit in any action to search or seize material in or on any private property to destroy, remove, or prevent the nuisance, source of filth, or cause of sickness, if there is probable cause to believe a public health hazard or public health nuisance exists on or in that property, and shall carry out any other preventive measures the public health unit requests. For purposes of this subsection, a request from a public health unit means a request for assistance which is specific to a public health nuisance and is not a continuous request for assistance.

        Destruction of nuisance property is a drastic remedy, and it must necessarily be a remedy of last resort unless the property is of such nature that its use or possession cannot be other than for evil.

        Where less drastic means are available to correct or alleviate the problem, destruction of private property deemed a nuisance is an arbitrary act that is prohibited as a matter of law. City of Minot v. Freelander, 380 N.W.2d 321, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       A district board of health may acquire by lease, purchase, construction, or gift for district health office use and control property for all purposes authorized by law or necessary to the exercise of the powers granted in this chapter. The district board of health may finance the purchase, construction, or equipping of a building on owned or leased property for the use and purpose for which the health district is formed and carry out the functions of the health district in either of the following ways:

       Bonds issued under this section and income under this section are exempt from any taxes except inheritance, estate, and transfer taxes. The indebtedness for which the bonds are issued, or for which a mortgage may be given as under this section, is neither an obligation or an indebtedness of this state nor of the counties or cities comprising the district board of health. Any indebtedness under this section may be foreclosed in any manner provided by law. The district board of health may convey or transfer property acquired as provided under this section. If, upon dissolution of a health district, any balance remains in the health district fund after all obligations have been paid, the balance must be transferred to the general fund of the counties comprising the health district in proportion to the assessed valuation most recently used in preparing the health district budget under this chapter. If any county in the district withdraws from a health district, any assets and inventory of supplies and equipment located in the county for use in health district programs and services remain the property of the district for use elsewhere in the district.
