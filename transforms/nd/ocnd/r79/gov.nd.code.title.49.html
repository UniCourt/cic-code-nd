        Regulation of an electric service is not a “quintessential act” of Indian tribe’s right of self-government, so as to preclude public service commission exercise of this jurisdiction over electric suppliers on reservation.

        Because there was no tradition of sovereignty by Indian tribe over electric service, and because there was a potential economic impact on consumers beyond reservation boundaries, the state’s interest in regulating electric utility outweighed minimal burden on tribal self-government.

        Public service commission’s restatement of unamortized investment-tax-credit (ITC) balance to reflect amortization over a 26-year period constituted a form of improper retroactive ratemaking which decreased future rates to compensate for previous higher rates which were based, in part, upon the commission’s initial acceptance of a 20-year ITC amortization period; the commission, in requiring utility to change to a 26-year amortization period, could only adjust the amortization schedule of utility’s remaining unamortized investment-tax-credit balance.

        The requirement that information in a public utility’s tariff be available for public inspection is rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of policing irregularities in the handling of public matters affecting the rates paid by citizens for an essential commodity in this state. Under these circumstances, a natural gas distributor could have no reasonable, investment-backed expectation that the price and volume data in its tariff would not be available for public inspection, and therefore, no governmental “taking” would be implicated by requiring disclosure.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly establishes a state renewable and recycled energy objective that ten percent of all electricity sold at retail within the state by the year 2015 be obtained from renewable energy and recycled energy sources. The objective must be measured by qualifying megawatt-hours delivered at retail or by certificates representing credits purchased and retired to offset nonqualifying retail sales. This objective is voluntary and there is no penalty or sanction for a retail provider of electricity that fails to meet this objective. The objective applies to all retail providers of electricity in the state, regardless of the ownership status of the electricity retailer. Municipal and cooperative utilities that receive wholesale electricity through a municipal power agency or generation and transmission cooperative may aggregate their renewable and recycled energy objective resources to meet this objective.

        Although electric public utilities must, with few exceptions, secure a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the public service commission (psc) in order to extend their electric distribution facilities, electric cooperatives are largely unregulated in the sense that they have the ability to expand their electrical services without having to first obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity.

        In light of the current regulatory situation, it may not always be possible to prevent some of the actual duplication of distribution facilities which may occur in practice when cooperatives extend their existing electrical systems; however, when a complaint is filed under the provision of the Territorial Integrity Act, the question of “which electric suppliers’ facilities are actually duplicative or wasteful” is one of fact for the public service commission to determine.

        Where the factors of customer preference, location of the lines, reliability of service, economic return, and wasteful duplication favored the cooperative, or favored neither the utility nor the cooperative, there was no weight of evidence to justify the commission’s conclusion that the public convenience and necessity required issuance of a certificate.

        If this section were interpreted to prohibit only interference with actual service to existing customers, the public service commission would have no authority to act, regardless of the amount of duplication in investments and electric facilities in an annexed area, unless a utility attempted to serve a customer already being served by a cooperative, and under that rationale, the public utility could extend its services to areas as small as city lots without creating an unreasonable duplication of services. Instead, the public service commission must look at the existing electric facilities that the rural electric cooperative and electric public utility have in place in the area annexed by the municipality and determine whether extension of the utilities services in that area would constitute an unreasonable duplication of capital-intensive facilities and services already provided by the cooperative.

        In light of the current regulatory situation, it may not always be possible to prevent some of the actual duplication of distribution facilities which may occur in practice when cooperatives extend their existing electrical systems; however, when a complaint is filed under the provision of the Territorial Integrity Act, the question of “which electric suppliers’ facilities are actually duplicative or wasteful” is one of fact for the public service commission to determine.

       This section authorizing service area agreements is intended to encourage harmony and operational efficiency among electric providers, promote safety, discourage unreasonable duplication of electric facilities, assure adequate and reliable electric service for all consumers and territories within the state, and provide antitrust immunity to electric providers that negotiate service area agreements in accordance with this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-03s49-03-06ol12">
       An electric provider may enter into agreements with other electric providers having adjacent or intermingled electric supply facilities for the purpose of establishing service areas and designating the service locations to be served by each electric provider. The designated service locations may include all or any portion of the service locations within a service area that are being served by the electric providers at the time of the agreement, or that could be economically served by the then existing facilities of the electric providers, or by reasonable and economic extensions of such existing facilities. The service area agreement must provide that it is subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the commission to settle all service location disputes between the contracting electric providers arising under the agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-03s49-03-06ol13">
       Electric providers may enter into written agreements for the sale, transfer, exchange, or lease of equipment or facilities used to serve the areas that are the subject of a service area agreement. Any sale, exchange, transfer, or lease of equipment, plant, or facilities made under this subsection is subject to sections 49-04-05 and 10-13-08.1.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-03s49-03-06ol14">
       A service area agreement shall be promptly filed with the commission which must issue a notice of the filing within thirty days. Upon the commission’s order, or if an affected electric consumer or electric provider requests a hearing within twenty days of the notice, the commission shall hold a hearing on the service area agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-03s49-03-06ol15">
       The public service commission shall approve or disapprove a service area agreement. The commission may not revise a service area agreement except by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement.

      <li id="t49c49-03s49-03-06ol16">
       A service area agreement shall be valid and enforceable if the commission, after notice as provided in subsection 4, approves the agreement and finds that the agreement complies with this section and is in the public interest.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-03s49-03-06ol17">
       Upon approval of a service area agreement, the commission shall issue its order and any necessary certificates of public convenience and necessity authorizing an electric public utility to extend its plant and system and to provide electric service to service locations within the service areas.

       The governing board of a city may require approval or disapproval of a service area agreement between electric providers to the extent the agreement encompasses service locations within the city.

      Before any certificate may be issued under this chapter, a certified copy of the articles of incorporation, charter, or organization of the public utility, if the applicant is a corporation or a limited liability company, shall be filed with the commission. At the hearing on the application as provided in section 49-03.1-03, the applicant shall submit evidence showing that the applicant has received the consent, franchise, permit, ordinance, or other authority of the proper municipality or other public authority, if required, or has or is about to make application therefor. The commission shall have the power, after notice and hearing, to do any of the following:
     </p>

      <li id="t49c49-03.1s49-03.1-05ol14">
       Issue the certificate for the partial exercise of the right or privilege sought, conditioned upon the applicant’s having secured or upon the applicant’s securing the consent, franchise, permit, ordinance, or other authority of the proper municipality or other public authority, and may attach to the exercise of the rights granted by any certificate such terms and conditions as in its judgment the public convenience and necessity may require.
      </li>
     </ol>

      It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to charge or receive any greater compensation in the aggregate for the transportation of passengers, or of a like kind of freight or property, for a shorter than for a longer distance, all or any portion of the shorter haul being included within the longer. A common carrier shall charge no more for transporting passengers or freight to or from any point than a fair and just rate as compared with the price it charges for the same kind of transportation to or from any other point. All the provisions of this section shall apply to the transportation of passengers and all kinds of freight and property shipped and transported over one or more connecting lines. Such connecting lines shall transfer car lots without extra compensation, and shall transfer less than car lots at actual cost for such transfer. Rates shall be made and published by connecting lines for continuous shipment upon demand of any shipper or shippers and such rates so made by two or more connecting lines shall be no greater in the aggregate than the rate would be if shipped continuously upon one line of road. The commission may, upon application by a common carrier, permit and prescribe the extent to which any such carrier may be relieved from the operation of the principles contained in this section.

The district court, in case it stays or suspends the order or decision of the commission in any matter affecting rates, also by order shall direct the public utility affected to pay into court, from time to time, there to be impounded until the final decision of the case, or into some bank or trust company paying interest on deposits, under such conditions as the court may prescribe, all sums of money which it may collect from any corporation, limited liability company, or person in excess of the sum which such corporation, limited liability company, or person would have been compelled to pay if the order or decision of the commission had not been stayed or suspended. Upon a final determination of an appeal, the court shall make an appropriate order disposing of the impounded funds in accordance with such determination. In the event the public utility shall fail to comply with the conditions of the stay bond, the commission may sue thereon for the use and benefit of the patrons or others who have suffered damage by reason of the stay.

     <p>
      In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, resource addition means construction, modification, purchase, or lease of an energy conversion facility, renewable energy facility, demand response system, transmission facility, or a contract to acquire energy, capacity, or demand response for the purpose of providing electric service. A public utility that intends to make a resource addition may file an application with the commission for an advance determination of prudence regarding the resource addition. The commission shall pay the expenses associated with investigating the application made by the public utility for prudence of a resource addition from the application fee paid by the public utility in accordance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t49c49-02s49-02-02" target="_self">49-02-02</a></cite>.
     </p>

       The commission may issue an order approving the prudence of a resource addition if:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t49c49-05s49-05-16ol11a">
         The public utility files with its application a projection of costs to the date of the anticipated commercial operation of the resource addition;

         The public utility files with its application a fee in the amount of one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars. Upon request of the commission and with the approval of the emergency commission, the applicant shall pay such additional fees as are reasonably necessary for completion of the application process by the commission. The commission may waive or reduce the fee.

       A resource addition approved by the commission is subject to reporting requirements until commercial operation of the resource addition.

      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-05s49-05-16ol15">
       Following an initial commission order, the commission may, upon notice and hearing, if appropriate, in accordance with section 49-02-02 determine that continuation of a resource addition is no longer prudent or that its prior order should be modified. Expenses incurred in processing the case must be paid from the fee, including any previously made refund thereof, filed with the prudence determination application for the resource addition.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-05s49-05-16ol16">
       The public utility may recover in its rates, and in a timely manner consistent with the public utility’s financial obligations, the amounts the public utility reasonably incurred or obligated on a prudent resource addition, including accrued allowance for funds used during construction, even though the resource addition may never be fully operational or used by the public utility to serve its customers. The cost amortization period for a discontinued resource addition may not exceed five years from the date commencement of the recovery is approved by the commission. No return on amounts incurred or obligated by the public utility may be authorized for the period after the resource addition is discontinued. The public utility may request an order from the commission for deferred accounting treatment for costs incurred for a discontinued resource addition.

        “Going Concern” Value.

       A utility plant which had a long history of continuous profitable operation over a long period of years had a going concern value under C.L. 1913, 1925 Supp., § 4609c42.
   Northern States Power Co. v. Board of R.R. Comm'rs, 71 N.D. 1, 298 N.W. 423, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under C.L. 1913, 1925 Supp., § 4609c42, going concern value was a property right to be considered in determining the valuation of utility property for ratemaking purposes.
   Northern States Power Co. v. Board of R.R. Comm'rs, 71 N.D. 1, 298 N.W. 423, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1941).

       The fact that the depreciation of a utility’s property was computed upon the basis of its actual physical condition, rather than upon a salvage basis, could not be construed as an allowance of going concern value.

      If no new rate shall have been agreed upon, as provided in section 49-06-05, then pending the investigation and final order of the commission, if it is of the opinion that public interest so requires, the commission immediately shall make an order that the utility shall file with the commission a bond of a corporate surety company, approved by the commission and authorized to do a surety business within this state. The bond shall be payable to the commission for the use and benefit of the customers and patrons of the utility and shall be conditioned that if the rates fixed, determined, and prescribed by the final order are less than the rates charged, received, and collected by the public utility during the period of the investigation, the public utility as principal shall remit to the several customers, patrons, or users of its service during the period between the date of the order directing a valuation or revaluation and the date of the final order fixing, determining, and prescribing the rates to be charged, received, and collected by the utility company the amount payable under this section. If the utility does not remit to its customers and patrons the differences between the amount paid by them and the new rate prescribed by the final order, the commission may maintain an action on the bond for the benefit of the customers and patrons. The amount to be paid and remitted to each of the several customers, patrons, or users shall be such sum as such customer, patron, or user has paid to the utility for the service over and above the amounts that such customer, patron, or user would have paid during that time had the rates fixed, determined, and prescribed in the final order been in effect during that period. The bond or undertaking shall be filed with the commission within thirty days after the service of the order upon such public utility. Service of the order may be made by personal service upon the public utility or by registered or certified mail, and if by registered or certified mail, service shall be deemed completed when the registered or certified mail is delivered to the public utility, as evidenced by the return receipt for the mail.

     <p>
      If, within thirty days after the service of the order, as set forth in section 49-06-06, the public utility fails, neglects, and refuses to file a bond or undertaking with the commission, then the commission immediately shall fix, determine, and prescribe temporary rates to be charged by such public utility pending the final determination of said rate proceeding. The temporary rates, so fixed, determined, and prescribed shall be sufficient to provide a return of not less than five percent per annum upon the original cost less accrued depreciation of the physical property of said public utility used and useful in the public service. If the duly verified reports of said utility to the commission do not show the original cost, less accrued depreciation, of said property, the commission may estimate said cost less depreciation and fix, determine, and prescribe rates as hereinbefore provided. In determining the original cost or in estimating the cost as herein provided, the commission may take into consideration any report, annual or otherwise, filed with it by any utility, together with any other fact or information which the commission may acquire or receive from an investigation of the books, records, or papers of such public utility and from an inspection of its property, or from the examination of any report, annual or otherwise, made by the public utility and filed with the state tax commissioner, or any report, annual or otherwise, made by the said public utility to the federal power commission, federal communications commission, or federal securities and exchange commission.

A civil penalty may be compromised by the commission. In determining the amount of a civil penalty, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, the commission shall consider the appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, the nature, circumstances, and gravity of the violation, the degree of culpability, any history of prior violations, the effect on ability to continue to do business, the good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve compliance, after notification of a violation, and such other matters as justice may require. The amount of the penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the state of North Dakota to the person charged or may be recovered in a civil action in the district court of Burleigh County.

     <p>
      Unless otherwise allowed by the commission, any railroad corporation abandoning the use of any railway line in this state shall remove and clear all rail, ties, materials, supplies, and debris from the railway line and leave the surface in a condition easily traversable by a motor vehicle, and shall control noxious weeds on the railway line right of way within a reasonable time. On request of a city or county in which there is an abandoned line, the commission shall require the railroad corporation, as to railway line right of way in that city or county, within a reasonable time, to take the action required by this section. On request of any state agency having an interest in any property abutting an abandoned railway line right of way, the commission shall require the railroad corporation, as to that railway line right of way, within a reasonable time, to take the action required by this section. The commission shall take all action necessary and appropriate, including the adoption of rules under chapter 28-32, to enforce this section. If a railroad corporation fails to take action required by this section, the requesting entity may do the work on the parts of the abandoned railway line right of way under that entity’s jurisdiction. A county may do the work on the parts of the abandoned railway line right of way in the county, regardless of whether those parts are inside city limits. The entity doing the work may charge the railroad corporation the reasonable expense of doing the work. If the charges remain unpaid after ninety days, the entity may certify to the county auditor the amount of the charges imposed under this section. These charges become part of the taxes levied against the land for the ensuing year and must be collected in the same manner as other real estate taxes and placed to the credit of the jurisdiction entitled to the charges. The taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment is governed by chapter 57-23.

      The commission, for the protection of persons and property, may adopt and enforce railroad safety rules not inconsistent with any federal agency having jurisdiction over railroads. The commission may adopt rules more stringent than federal rules when necessary to eliminate an essentially state or local safety hazard if the rules are not incompatible with any federal law or rule and do not create an undue burden on interstate commerce.

      Any corporation operating a railroad and failing to fence the same against livestock running at large where the duty to fence exists is liable to the owner of any stock killed or injured by reason of the want of such fence for the full amount of the damages sustained by the owner, unless the injury was occasioned by the grossly negligent act of the owner of the stock or the owner’s agent. To recover, the owner of the stock must prove only the loss of or injury to the owner’s property. Notice in writing that a loss or injury has occurred, accompanied by an affidavit thereof, must be served upon an officer of the corporation or upon a station or ticket agent employed by the corporation in the county where the loss or injury occurred. If the corporation fails or neglects to pay the damages within ninety days after the notice is served on it, the owner is entitled to recover from the corporation double the amount of damages actually sustained by the owner, and a reasonable attorney’s fee when it is adjudged by a court of competent jurisdiction that the claimant is entitled to the amount claimed.

    Discrimination between shippers in facilities furnished, service rendered, and rates prohibited.

     <p>
      No common pipeline carrier may discriminate between or against shippers in regard to facilities furnished, services rendered, or rates charged under the same or similar circumstances in the transportation of crude petroleum, coal, gas, or carbon dioxide, nor may there be any discrimination in the transportation of crude petroleum, coal, gas, or carbon dioxide produced or purchased by itself directly or indirectly. In this connection the pipeline must be considered as a shipper of the crude petroleum, coal, gas, or carbon dioxide produced or purchased by itself directly or indirectly and handled through its facilities. No such carrier in such operation, directly or indirectly, may charge, demand, collect, or receive from anyone a greater or lesser compensation for any service rendered than from another for a like contemporaneous service. This does not limit the right of the commission to prescribe rates and regulations from or to some places different from other rates or regulations for transportation from or to other places as it may determine, nor is any carrier guilty of discrimination when obeying any order of the commission. Where there is offered for transportation more crude petroleum, coal, or carbon dioxide than can be transported immediately, the same must be apportioned equitably. Gas must be taken on a pro rata basis or on such basis as may be established by the industrial commission pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.38.html#t38c38-08s38-08-06" target="_blank">38-08-06</a></cite>.

     <p>
      Whenever any city, or the inhabitants thereof within, or contiguous to, the territory served by an electric transmission line operated by a public utility subject to the jurisdiction of the commission shall desire to obtain the service furnished by such public utility, the proper authorities of such city, or fifteen percent of the inhabitants thereof, may petition the commission for the extension of such transmission line and service to, into, or through such municipality. The commission thereupon shall enter into an investigation concerning the practicability and reasonableness of such proposed extension and service and the public convenience and necessity to be subserved thereby, and if, after notice and hearing, the commission finds that such extension of line and service is practicable and can be made reasonably, taking into consideration the amount of revenue likely to be derived therefrom and the prospect for a reasonable return to the utility upon the value of such extension, and further finds that public convenience and necessity will be subserved thereby, and that the city or territory contiguous thereto is not already receiving electric service from another public utility or electric cooperative corporation, the commission, by its order, shall require the extension of such line and service by such public utility for the purpose of serving such municipality and the inhabitants thereof upon condition that a franchise for such operation be granted to such public utility by the proper authorities of such municipality, and upon such other terms and conditions as may be just and reasonable. A certified copy of such order, when filed with the auditor of such municipality, shall have the same force and effect as an application by the utility for a franchise. The commission shall fix just and reasonable rates for such service and such reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary pertaining thereto.

     <p>
      There is a rebuttable presumption that prices for essential telecommunications services in effect on July 1, 1989, are fair and reasonable. Any person may complain to the commission, or the commission on its own motion may complain and begin investigation, of the reasonableness, fairness, or adequacy of any price for any essential or nonessential service. Any notice and hearing by the commission will be provided in accordance with chapter 28-32 and the commission can only set aside, after notice and hearing, any price for a service it investigates pursuant to this section which it determines to be unreasonable, unfair, or inadequate. This section must be construed to authorize the commission to set aside any unreasonable, unfair, or inadequate price set by a telecommunications company for the connection between facilities of two or more telecommunications companies and for the transfer of telecommunications, provided this section may not be construed to set aside any price set by contract between telecommunications companies and in effect on July 1, 1989, upon complaint by one of the parties to the contract that the price is unreasonably high.

      It shall be unlawful for any telecommunications company to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in prices, practices, or service for or in connection with like telecommunications service, or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any person or telecommunications company or to subject any person or telecommunications company to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in the service rendered by it to the public or to a telecommunications company, or to charge or receive for any such service rendered, more or less than the prices provided for in the schedules then on file with the commission. A telecommunications company providing intrastate interexchange message toll services shall charge uniform prices on all routes where it offers such services. A telecommunications company providing local exchange service and message toll and private line services shall cover, in its price for message toll and private line services, the price of providing access service in its own exchanges. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent any telecommunications company from offering or providing volume or other discounts based on reasonable business practices; from introducing promotional offerings, including special incentives, competitive discounts, and price waivers; from passing through any state, municipal or local taxes or fees to the specific geographic areas from which the taxes or fees originate; from contracting with a retail subscriber to provide telecommunications services at prices negotiated with the subscriber to meet service requests of the subscriber or competitive offerings of another telecommunications company; or from furnishing free telecommunications service or service at reduced prices to its officers, agents, servants, or employees.

If such use is directed, the telecommunications company to which the use is permitted is liable to the owner or other users of such facilities or services for such damage as may result therefrom to the property of such owner or other users thereof.

     <p>
      Unless the governing body of a political subdivision has submitted to the qualified electors of that political subdivision the question of whether to impose a fee other than a fee for management costs and a majority of the voters approved the fee, a political subdivision may not impose after December 31, 1998, any fee to recover from a telecommunications company for the use of its right of way, other than a fee for its management costs. If requested by a political subdivision, in order to accomplish a necessary public improvement on the right of way, a telecommunications company promptly shall remove its facilities from the public right of way or shall relocate or adjust its facilities within the public right of way at no cost to the political subdivision. Necessary public improvements are limited to construction and maintenance activities directly related to improved transportation and safety. A political subdivision may recover from a telecommunications company only those management costs caused by the telecommunications company activity in the public right of way. A fee or other obligation under this section must be imposed on a competitively neutral basis. When a political subdivision’s management costs cannot be attributed to only one entity, those costs must be allocated among all users of the public rights of way, including the political subdivision itself. The allocation must reflect proportionately the costs incurred by the political subdivision as a result of the various types of uses of the public right of way. This section does not prohibit the collection of a franchise fee as permitted in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t49c49-21s49-21-29" target="_self">49-21-29</a></cite>.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If any work is performed within six feet [1.83 meters] of any high voltage overhead line, or if mechanical equipment or machinery used near high voltage overhead lines is capable of motion to within ten feet [3.05 meters] of any high voltage overhead line, the person responsible for the work shall notify the operator of the high voltage overhead line of the intent to work near the line. The work may be pursued only after the person and the operator of the line have provided protection for endangered persons by mechanical or insulated barriers, by de-energizing and grounding the line, or by temporary relocation of the line. The person working near the overhead line must pay the operator actual expenses necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter, except that the operator of the line is responsible for the cost if the line was installed closer to an existing fixture or structure than the minimum clearance required by the latest edition of the national electrical safety code, as adopted by the public service commission. The operator of the line need not take the precautions until the person working near the line pays the necessary expenses. Within five business days after payment of those expenses, or as otherwise agreed upon in writing by the person responsible for the work, the operator of the line shall complete the arrangements for protection of endangered persons.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds that the construction of energy conversion facilities and transmission facilities affects the environment and the welfare of the citizens of this state. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the location, construction, and operation of energy conversion facilities and transmission facilities will produce minimal adverse effects on the environment and upon the welfare of the citizens of this state by providing that no energy conversion facility or transmission facility shall be located, constructed, and operated within this state without a certificate of site compatibility or a route permit acquired pursuant to this chapter. The legislative assembly hereby declares it to be the policy of this state to site energy conversion facilities and to route transmission facilities in an orderly manner compatible with environmental preservation and the efficient use of resources. In accordance with this policy, sites and routes shall be chosen which minimize adverse human and environmental impact while ensuring continuing system reliability and integrity and ensuring that energy needs are met and fulfilled in an orderly and timely fashion.

      <li id="t49c49-22s49-22-05.1ol11">
       The commission shall develop criteria to be used in identifying exclusion and avoidance areas and to guide the site, corridor, and route suitability evaluation and designation process. The criteria also may include an identification of impacts and policies or practices which may be considered in the evaluation and designation process.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-22s49-22-05.1ol12">
       The commission may not identify prime farmland, unique farmland, or irrigated land as exclusion or avoidance areas when evaluating and designating geographical areas for site, corridor, or route suitability.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-22s49-22-05.1ol13">
       Except for electric transmission lines in existence before July 1, 1983, areas within five hundred feet [152.4 meters] of an inhabited rural residence must be designated avoidance areas. This criterion does not apply to a water pipeline. The five hundred foot [152.4 meter] avoidance area criteria for an inhabited rural residence may be waived by the owner of the inhabited rural residence in writing.
      </li>
      <li id="t49c49-22s49-22-05.1ol14">
       Areas less than one and one-tenth times the height of the turbine from the property line of a nonparticipating landowner and less than three times the height of the turbine or more from an inhabited rural residence of a nonparticipating landowner, must be excluded in the consideration of a site for a wind energy conversion area, unless a variance is granted. The commission may grant a variance if an authorized representative or agent of the permittee, the nonparticipating landowner, and affected parties with associated wind rights file a written agreement expressing the support of all parties for a variance to reduce the setback requirement in this subsection. A nonparticipating landowner is a landowner that has not signed a wind option or an easement agreement with the permittee of the wind energy conversion facility as defined in chapter 17-04. A local zoning authority may require setback distances greater than those required under this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, “height of the turbine” means the distance from the base of the wind turbine to the turbine blade tip when it is in its highest position.

      Any easement for an electric transmission facility as defined in this chapter acquired contractually by a utility after July 1, 1979, shall give the landowner the option of receiving a single sum payment for the easement or receiving payment in annual installments of equal amounts including interest on the outstanding balance to be paid by the utility at a rate equal to the average rate paid during that year by the Bank of North Dakota on a certificate of deposit in an amount equal to the outstanding balance. The first annual installments shall be prorated to July first and all following annual installments shall fall due on July first. The option provided herein shall not apply to any easement providing for compensation of less than five thousand dollars. In the event the landowner elects to receive the compensation in annual payments, the benefits unpaid at the time of sale of the real estate to which the easement attaches shall accrue to the purchaser of said real estate thereafter. The utility right-of-way agent shall inform the property owner of the owner’s option to choose annual installments.

      <p>
       District court properly affirmed the Public Service Commission’s order summarily dismissing a complaint filed by the Environmental Law and Policy Center and Dakota Resource Council—seeking a declaration that a gas company’s refinery was subject to the statutory siting process—because the Commission’s regulatory authority was limited to projects that met the statutory definition of “gas or liquid energy conversion facility,” a refinery not designed for or capable of refining 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) was not a “gas or liquid energy conversion facility” as that term was defined, and the gas company’s planned facility was designed for and capable of refining no more than 49,500 bpd.

    Statement of policy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds the construction of energy conversion facilities and transmission facilities affects the environment and the welfare of the citizens of this state. It is necessary to ensure the location, construction, and operation of energy conversion facilities and transmission facilities will produce minimal adverse effects on the environment and the welfare of the citizens of this state by prohibiting energy conversion facilities and transmission facilities from being located, constructed, or operated within this state without a certificate of site compatibility or a route permit acquired under this chapter. The policy of this state is to site energy conversion facilities and to route transmission facilities in an orderly manner compatible with environmental preservation and the efficient use of resources. Sites and routes must be selected to minimize adverse human and environmental impact while ensuring continuing system reliability and integrity and fulfilling energy needs in an orderly and timely fashion.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The commission shall develop criteria to be used in identifying exclusion and avoidance areas and to guide the site, corridor, and route suitability evaluation and designation process. Except for oil and gas transmission lines in existence before July 1, 1983, areas within five hundred feet [152.4 meters] of an inhabited rural residence must be designated avoidance areas. This criterion does not apply to a water pipeline. The five hundred foot [152.4 meter] avoidance area criteria for an inhabited rural residence may be waived by the owner of the inhabited rural residence in writing. The criteria also may include an identification of impacts and policies or practices which may be considered in the evaluation and designation process.
