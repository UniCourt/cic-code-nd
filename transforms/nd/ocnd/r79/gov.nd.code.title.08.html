        A taxicab company was liable for assault and rape of passenger by both the cab driver and a passenger, the undisputed evidence showing willful connivance with and assistance by the driver in the rape by the fellow passenger.

        Where the trial court, in its instructions to the jury, characterized the degree of care required of the driver of a taxicab as the “utmost care”, and then defined “utmost care” as the “highest degree of care possible in the nature of the case”, and where these words were followed by the further statement that the carrier is not an insurer but must “exercise a high degree of care and skill to secure the safe transportation of its passengers”, such instructions were proper.

        A girl of fourteen, while riding in a taxicab, by virtue of the fact that she was a passenger was not only entitled to be protected against the negligent acts of the company’s cab driver resulting from the omission to perform the company’s duties to its passengers, but she was likewise entitled to be protected against the unwarranted assault committed on her person by the cab driver during the continuance of the carrier-passenger relationship. Haser v. Pape, 77 N.D. 36, 39 N.W.2d 578, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 54</cite> (N.D. 1949).

        Where taxi had the right of way entering an intersection, and another vehicle, which entered the intersection wrongfully, was not seen by the driver of the taxi until it was within twenty feet, even though the approaching vehicle could have been seen at least one hundred fifty feet from the intersection, the driver of the taxi failed to exercise the degree of care required by this section.

        A carrier may contract that the shipper must give notice, in writing, of any claim for damages before the property is removed from the place of destination. Cooke v. Northern Pac. Ry., 22 N.D. 266, 133 N.W. 303, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1911).

        The common-law liability of a common carrier may be limited or modified by special contract but it cannot exonerate itself from liability for negligence, fraud, or other wrongful act.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A common carrier is liable for loss or injury to property for any cause whatever, except for specified causes not relevant to the case, from the time the carrier accepts the property until proper delivery; even when goods being transported by common carrier are initially damaged by an act of God or other cause for which the carrier is exempt from liability, the common carrier has a duty to minimize or mitigate damages to the property and is liable for failure to do so. Smith v. Watson, 406 N.W.2d 685, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 327</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the damage to the owner’s bees, hives, and equipment resulted from a highway accident involving the common carrier’s driver, the cleanup and salvage operation for the accident was conducted through the efforts of the common carrier’s insurance company, and whatever cargo was salvageable was used as payment for the cleanup operation, the common carrier had the primary responsibility to retain the necessary personnel and machinery to effectuate a cleanup and salvage operation to minimize loss of or damage to the cargo.

        This section is in the main an enactment of the common law making common carriers insurers of property entrusted to them for transportation. Insofar as it varies from the common law it does so in favor of the carrier. The only defenses which the carrier can interpose, where property is lost in transit, are those named as exceptions relieving him from liability as an insurer, except in cases where there is a special contract.
