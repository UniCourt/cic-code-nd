The supervisors thereupon shall file an application, duly verified, with the secretary of state for the discontinuance of the district, and shall transmit with such application the certificate of the committee setting forth its determination that the continued operation of the district is not administratively feasible. The application must recite what property, if any, of the district has been disposed of, the liabilities paid, and the property or proceeds paid over as provided herein and must set forth a full accounting of such properties and their sale proceeds. The secretary of state shall issue to the supervisors a certificate of dissolution and record the certificate in an appropriate record in the secretary of state’s office.

      The commissioner may inspect and certify any plant and plant product, when offered for export or shipment from within the state and to certify, to shippers and interested parties as to the freedom of the products from injurious pests according to the phytosanitary requirements of other states and foreign countries. Authority for inspection and certification under this section is not limited to plants defined in section 4.1-23-01. The commissioner may make reasonable charges and use any means necessary to accomplish this objective. A portion of the fees collected may be deposited in the commissioner’s operating fund equivalent to the amount that the United States department of agriculture assesses the department for federal plant export certificates issued by the commissioner. A certificate may be withheld or not issued if the product does not meet phytosanitary or import requirements and if all state licensing and bonding requirements have not been met. Consignee names and addresses on phytosanitary certificates are confidential.

       If it appears the financial condition of any applicant or licensee who purchases milk from a dairy producer is not adequate to reasonably assure payment to dairy producers when due for the milk to be purchased, or in lieu of annually filing with the department an audited financial statement as required in section 4.1-25-05, the department shall require from an applicant or licensee security or other assurances in one of the following forms:

        The filing of a surety bond acceptable to the department. The amount of the surety bond must be determined on the basis of average purchases of milk from dairy producers during the previous year. If payment for milk purchased from dairy producers is made on a weekly basis, the amount of the surety bond must be at least in an amount equal to the average weekly purchases of milk. If payment for milk purchased from dairy producers is made on a semimonthly basis, the amount of the surety bond must be at least in an amount equal to the average semimonthly purchases of milk. If the period of payment for milk purchased from dairy producers is made on a basis involving periods of time greater than semimonthly, the amount of the surety bond must be at least in an amount equal to the average purchases of milk for that greater period of time. The amount of the bond for each period of payment must also include an amount equal to at least the average purchases for three days following the close of the period of payment. The amount of the surety bond of any licensee who pays assignments to creditors of a producer of milk at a lesser frequency than the licensee pays the producer must also include an amount equal to the value of assignments from the prior payment period. The commissioner must be named as obligee, but the bond or draft must be held for the purpose of protecting, and for the benefit of, any dairy producer, and the full and complete payment to that dairy producer for all milk purchased by the licensee. The aggregate liability of the bonding company or the department to all dairy producers may not exceed the amount of the bond.

In case of illness or necessary absence, a licensee may appoint a substitute for a period not to exceed six days in one calendar year, unless specific approval for a longer period is obtained from the commissioner. The licensee is responsible for the acts of the substitute. An applicant shall file an application with the department stating the type of sampling, hauling, or testing for which the applicant wishes to be licensed. Before a license is issued, the applicant shall receive training in the sampling of milk or milk products as may be required by the department, and shall pass a written examination prepared and administered by the department. The applicant must show knowledge of the requirements of this chapter and must prove by actual demonstration that the applicant is competent and qualified to perform each type of sampling and testing listed on the application. The commissioner shall issue a license which states the types of sampling, hauling, or testing for which the applicant is qualified. Additions may be added to the application form and license, without charge, after the license has been issued, upon the request of the licensee, after receiving additional training and passing the required examinations. Examinations must be given by the department at times and places as the department shall determine. A licensee is not required to take additional examinations when renewing a license unless required by the commissioner. All testers and samplers shall attend a training session sponsored by the department every two years. Retraining or retesting or both may be required when the commissioner reasonably determines it to be necessary. Licenses issued under this section expire on December thirtieth of each year. Testers’ licenses must be posted conspicuously in the licensee’s place of operation, and are not transferable. Samplers’ licenses must be carried by the sampler at all times during sampling activities and are not transferable. The annual license fee is ten dollars. A five dollar penalty fee is applied if renewals are not paid by January thirty-first.

       If a disagreement between a seller and a buyer or the legal representatives of both or either arises over the percentage of butterfat contained in any quantity of milk sold or offered for sale at the request of the owner and in the owner’s presence, a sample of the milk obtained as provided in section 4.1-25-27 and mutually agreed upon by the interested parties as being a representative sample must be sealed and mailed by the buyer to the office of the commissioner. Each sample mailed to the commissioner must include a statement giving the name and address of the seller and the buyer of the milk in question, the net weight, the percentage and amount of butterfat contained, the price per pound [.45 kilogram] for butterfat, and the amount of money paid or offered in payment for the same and bearing the signature of the seller and the buyer. The commissioner shall determine the percentage of butterfat contained in the sample and shall report of the result in triplicate, the original to be filed in the commissioner’s office, one copy to be sent to the seller, and one to the buyer of the milk. The percentage of butterfat determined and reported constitutes the “official butterfat test” and is the basis on which final settlement must be made. The fee for the official butterfat test and any other tests required must be in an amount as set by rule of the commissioner, considering the actual costs of the test, and the fee must be mailed to the commissioner at the time of forwarding the sample for the official butterfat or other test.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Before it is offered for sale, each animal that enters a livestock auction market must be inspected for health by a veterinarian licensed in this state and approved by the state board of animal health. Cattle also must be inspected for brands by a trained brand inspector, acting under rules adopted by the North Dakota stockmen’s association and the state board of animal health. Veterinary inspection must include all livestock, whether it is to be moved interstate or intrastate. The veterinary inspector must be recommended by the livestock auction market and approved by the state board of animal health. The veterinarian must be a local veterinarian or a veterinarian of the vicinity, unless there is no such veterinarian available. If the livestock auction agency fails to recommend a veterinarian within a reasonable time, the board may approve a veterinarian, if qualified and willing to accept the position at the market, and provide notice to the market agency of the appointment. The services and duties of the veterinary inspector are under the supervision of the state board of animal health and the inspector must be relieved of office when the inspector fails to perform the required services and duties. Fees for the inspection must be paid to the veterinarian by the livestock auction market company and must be in an amount agreed upon by the auction market company and the veterinarian.

      If an article or animal is condemned, it must be disposed of by destruction or sale, as directed by a court. If an article or animal is sold, the proceeds must be paid to the state, less the court costs, fees, storage, and reasonable expenses, but the article or animal must not be sold contrary to this chapter or federal law. If a bond is delivered conditioned that the article or animal not be sold or otherwise disposed of contrary to this chapter or federal law, the court may direct the article or animal be delivered to its owner subject to supervision by the commissioner.

      <p>
       District court did not misapply the law by concluding the notice requirement under N.D.C.C. § 4.1-33-18 applied because N.D.C.C. § 4.1-33-21 did not change that the requirements of § 4.1-33-18 applied to all civil actions seeking reimbursement for property damage as a result of a pesticide application. Laufer v. Doe, 2020 ND 159, 946 N.W.2d 707, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Property owner failed to show he complied with statutory notice requirements, and thus, the district court did not err in dismissing his claims that his crops were damages when a neighbor sprayed a neighboring field with herbicide and the herbicide drifted on the owner’s land; even if the owner’s telephone call provided a neighbor actual information about damages stemming from the chemical application, the call was not sufficient to comply with subsection (1). Laufer v. Doe, 2020 ND 159, 946 N.W.2d 707, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the word “shall” in subsection (1) creates a mandatory duty; the plain language of subsection (1) expressly prohibits a person from filing a civil action for property damage stemming from the application of pesticide without notifying the applicator by certified mail within 28 days from when the person first knew or should have known of the damage, and the failure to provide notice as required by the statute bars a lawsuit for damages.

       Plain language of the statute states a person must provide notice to the pesticide applicator by certified mail before the person may file a civil action seeking reimbursement for property damage allegedly stemming from the application of pesticide; the notice requirement applies to any civil action seeking reimbursement for damages caused by application of pesticide, and the statute unambiguously is not limited to actions under N.D.C.C. ch. 4.1-33.

     <p>
      If the commissioner has reason to believe on the basis of inspection or tests that any pesticide or device is in violation of any provision of this chapter, or if the registration of the pesticide has been canceled or suspended by the state or United States environmental protection agency, the commissioner may issue a written or printed “stop-sale, use, or removal” order to any person who owns, controls, or has custody of the pesticide or device. After receipt of the order, a person may not sell, use, or remove the pesticide or device described in the order except in accordance with the provisions of the order.

      Any person violating this chapter is guilty of an infraction. If a registrant was issued a warning by the commissioner under this chapter, upon violating this chapter, other than subdivision a of subsection 1 of section 4.1-34-02, that registrant is guilty of a class A misdemeanor and the registration of the article with which the violation occurred automatically terminates. A pesticide for which the registration has been terminated may not again be registered unless the pesticide, its labeling, and other material required to be submitted appear to the commissioner to comply with the requirements of this chapter. In addition to any criminal penalty, a person found guilty of violating this chapter or the rules adopted under this chapter is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each violation. The civil penalty may be imposed by a court in a civil proceeding or by the commissioner through an administrative hearing under chapter 28-32.

     <p>
      The owner or operator of an anhydrous ammonia storage facility or a mobile storage container shall apply to the agriculture commissioner and to the board of county commissioners for a license to site and operate the facility or mobile storage container. Neither an anhydrous ammonia storage facility nor mobile storage container may be operated without a license issued by the agriculture commissioner and the board of county commissioners of the county in which the facility is located. Any permanent anhydrous ammonia storage facility constructed before July 1, 1985, is exempt from the siting requirements of this chapter and may receive a license under this chapter regardless of noncompliance with the siting requirements. The commissioner or the board may deny a license for failure to remit the proper fee for failure to comply with the siting requirements of this chapter and rules adopted under this chapter if constructed after June 30, 1985, or for failure to comply with local siting requirements. The agriculture commissioner also may deny a license if the facility does not meet the initial inspection standards required by this chapter and by any rules adopted under this chapter. To obtain a license, an applicant shall submit with the application two sets of drawings or photographs showing, and two signed affidavits stating, the facility or mobile downloading site has been measured and meets the siting requirements. The drawings or photographs must show the proposed location of the tank and the surroundings in all directions. A set of drawings or photographs must be provided to the agriculture commissioner and a set must be provided to the board of county commissioners. An applicant for a mobile storage container license also shall submit a certification from the United States department of transportation.

       The commissioner shall register any livestock medicine that does not violate this chapter, upon the completion of an application by the manufacturer or distributor of the livestock medicine and the payment of the registration fee prescribed in section 4.1-53-04. Registration of livestock medicine is valid for a two-year period beginning July first and ending June thirtieth of every even-numbered year unless it is canceled by the commissioner because a change is made in the ingredients or formula of the livestock medicine or in the name, brand, or trademark under which the medicine is sold. In the event of any change, the medicine must be registered once again through an original application with the commissioner.
      </p>

       If requested by the farmer or the person holding the patent, the state seed commissioner shall accompany the person holding the patent at the time any sample is taken. The state seed commissioner may impose a fee for providing that service. The patent holder and the farmer shall each pay one-half of the fee charged by the commissioner.

       If the person holding a patent believes that the crop from which samples are to be taken may be subject to intentional damage or destruction, the person may seek a protection order from the district court. The protection order may not interrupt or interfere with normal farming practices, including harvest and tillage.

       The person holding the patent may not obtain more samples than are reasonably necessary to make a determination regarding patent infringement. An equal number of samples must remain in the custody of the state seed commissioner or the farmer for future comparison and verification purposes. All samples taken must be placed in containers labeled as to the date, time, and location from which they were taken. The labels must be signed by the farmer, the person who took the samples, and the state seed commissioner if the commissioner was present at the time the samples were taken. The patent holder and the farmer shall share equally the cost of the containers needed for the second set of samples that are retained by the state seed commissioner or the farmer. The farmer and the person holding the patent shall share equally the cost of the containers and the cost of obtaining the samples.

       The parties may participate in mediation at any time. The mediation must be conducted by a mediator jointly selected by the farmer and the person holding the patent. If the farmer and the person holding the patent are unable to select a mediator, the mediation must be conducted by an independent mediation service.

      <li id="t4.1c4.1-44s4.1-44-08ol110">
       If the case is not settled after mediation, either party may file a claim for relief with the federal district court having jurisdiction over the claim. Unless otherwise specified in a contract between the farmer and the person holding the patent, the appropriate state district court is the one that has jurisdiction over that portion of this state in which the farmer’s land is located.

The act of a majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the board of directors unless the act of a greater number is required by law or by the bylaws. A director participating in a meeting through an electronic communication medium may be considered to be present at the meeting for purposes of this chapter.

      The officers of the association must be a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and such other officers as may be created by the board of directors.

The president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer must be elected annually by the board of directors. Any office created by the board may be filled by appointment at any meeting of the board. Each elected officer holds office until that officer’s successor has been duly elected and qualified. Any officer elected or appointed may be removed by the board. The removal of any officer is without prejudice to any contractual rights of the officer. Election or appointment of an officer or agent does not create contractual rights. A vacancy in any office may be filled by the board of directors for the unexpired portion of the term.

       <p>
        A lease-purchase agreement for dairy cattle was deemed a sales transaction instead of a lease, even though the lessor-seller claimed a perfected security interest in the cattle through his brand on the cattle; therefore the debtor’s return of the cattle to the lessor-seller on the eve of bankruptcy was ruled a preferential transfer. In re Brower, 104 B.R. 226, 1988 Bankr. LEXIS 2517 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1988).
