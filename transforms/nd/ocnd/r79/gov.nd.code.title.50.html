       When a person entitled to poor relief in one county is so injured in another county that emergency relief is imperative, it is the duty of the county in which the injured person is found to furnish such emergency relief, and to this extent such county is the agent of county of legal settlement of injured person.

       Since the Department supervised the administration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), under N.D.C.C. § 50-01.1-03(4) and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t50c50-06s50-06-05" target="_self">50-06-05</a></cite>.1, and courts reviewing its determinations were charged with making limited review of decisions over which it had expertise, it could conclude that a nonrecurring expense incurred during one year should not be considered as an anticipated expense during the next year in determining eligibility for SNAP benefits. The one-time expense could not be considered to be an expense that would also impact SNAP eligibility during the next year.

        Since the Department supervised the administration of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), under N.D.C.C. § 50-01.1-03(4) and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t50c50-06s50-06-05" target="_self">50-06-05</a></cite>.1, and courts reviewing its determinations were charged with making limited review of decisions over which it had expertise, it could conclude that a nonrecurring expense incurred during one year should not be considered as an anticipated expense during the next year in determining eligibility for SNAP benefits. The one-time expense could not be considered to be an expense that would also impact SNAP eligibility during the next year.

       The state must advocate for the family by using political, economic, social, and judicial measures that support the unity and stability of the family so that the family can exercise its specific function of nurturing and protecting its members. If the family is to be nurtured and its members protected, the state must support programs that offer assistance for pregnant women and their families. Unjust social and economic structures such as poverty, sexism, and lack of adequate health care and information should be addressed. Women must have the ability to make responsible decisions concerning a pregnancy without losing other opportunities for a fulfilled life. Ensuring the dignity and rights of women and children and families is the operative principle underlying this Act.”

     <p>
      The department of human services shall limit the reimbursement for rental expense paid by a provider of services when a provider sells its skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, basic care facility, or other facility furnishing care to its residents, when a care rate is based, in part, upon property costs unique to that facility, to a third party who leases the facility back to the provider. The department’s reimbursement for rental expense may not exceed the lesser of the rental expense paid by the provider or the cost of ownership of the facility. The cost of ownership includes depreciation, interest, real estate taxes, and other expenses properly related to the facility. The department of human services shall apply this limit to rates set for each facility’s first fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 1985, but shall consider, in setting such rates, all sales occurring on or after July 18, 1984.

      The department of human services shall contract with qualified treatment service providers for the development and implementation of a program for gambling prevention, awareness, crisis intervention, rehabilitation, financial counseling, and mental health treatment services. The program may provide outpatient services, partial care services, aftercare services, intervention services, financial counseling services, consultation services, or other forms of preventive, rehabilitative, or treatment services for individuals with a gambling disorder. An individual who provides treatment services must be a licensed professional operating within the individual’s scope of practice. An individual who provides financial counseling services must be a certified consumer credit counselor with an accredited financial counseling agency. The department of human services may establish a sliding payment scale for services under the program. The department of human services may establish a centrally located repository of educational materials on identifying and treating gambling disorders. Any service fee collected by qualified treatment service providers for services provided under the contract must be applied toward the program’s gambling disorder services. The term “qualified treatment service provider” means an entity based in North Dakota which is experienced in and capable of delivering gambling disorder education, prevention, awareness, crisis intervention, rehabilitation, financial counseling, and mental health treatment services as defined by the department of human services. The term “gambling disorder” means a chronic, progressive disease that is characterized by a preoccupation with gambling, loss of control over gambling behaviors, and oftentimes disregard for the negative consequences as a result of gambling.

       Social service benefits were properly denied to petitioner where the petitioner smoked and lived in the same household in which her husband used an oxygen tank to breathe because the petitioner’s smoking was a “contraindicated practice” that could threaten the health or safety of clients, service providers, or others. The social services department was not unreasonable in concluding that the petitioner’s smoking was a contraindicated practice, and it did not exceed its authority by defining “contraindicated practices.”

      Expenses for care and treatment of each patient at the state hospital must be in accordance with the cost of providing care and treatment for the different degrees or conditions of mental and physical health and charges may be adjusted in accordance with the patient’s or other responsible party’s ability to pay which must include an estimate of potential future receipts including amounts from estates. The department shall recover expenses charged for care and treatment. The department may not recover expenses under this chapter for care and treatment of a patient transferred to the state hospital from a jail or regional corrections center. If any patient is receiving social security benefits or is a veteran who has received, is receiving, or is entitled to receive compensation or pension from the veterans’ administration, the expenses are a current claim against the patient and may be recovered monthly by the department except that any amount required by the payor of the benefits to be paid directly to the patient must be credited to the patient’s personal account from any money thus received.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no handicapped patient under twenty-one years of age or the estate or the parent of such patient may be charged for educational or related services provided at the state hospital. However, the department has prior claim on all benefits accruing to such patients for medical and medically related services under entitlement from the federal government, medical or hospital insurance contracts, workforce safety and insurance, or medical care and disability provisions of programs administered by the department. For the purposes of this section, “related services” means transportation and such developmental, corrective, and other supportive services, as determined by the department of public instruction, as are required to assist a handicapped patient to benefit from special education. The cost of related services, other than medical and medically related services, must be paid by the state hospital, the school district of residence of the handicapped child, and other appropriate state agencies and political subdivisions of this state. The department of public instruction, the department, the school district of residence, and other appropriate state agencies and political subdivisions, as determined by the department of public instruction, shall determine and agree to that portion of related services, other than medical and medically related services, for which each such agency and political subdivision shall be liable. The department of public instruction may adopt rules necessary to implement this section.

       Determination of ability to pay is a prerequisite to the execution of a judgment or the collection of an account for care and treatment when ability to pay has been brought into issue by patient’s request for relief due to inability to pay; however, determination of ability to pay is not required before state hospital can start collection proceedings when patient has not filed for relief, nor is such determination required as a prerequisite to ascertaining liability for an account even when patient has filed for such relief.

      <p>
       Determination of patient’s inability to pay does not discharge his liability for the cost of care and treatment provided and is not a valid defense to an action seeking a judgment for such care and treatment; however, such a determination may serve as a defense to or means of staying execution of such judgment.

    Expenses chargeable against guardianship estate of patient — Restrictions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The expenses chargeable by the state for the care and treatment of any patient at the state hospital must be charged against the guardianship estate of the patient, if the patient has an estate, subject to the following restrictions:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t50c50-06.3s50-06.3-09ol11">
       No part of the estate may be taken if the patient has dependents within the United States dependent upon the estate for support and the taking of all or a portion of the estate would result in undue hardship to those dependents.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c50-06.3s50-06.3-09ol12">
       No real property belonging to the estate may be sold during the lifetime of the patient except for the maintenance and support of the patient’s dependents, unless it is shown that the sale of the property will not result in undue hardship to those dependents, and it may be sold only upon the order of the district court having jurisdiction of the estate, with the consent of the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c50-06.3s50-06.3-09ol13">
       No personal property belonging to the estate may be sold within five years from the date upon which the patient was sent to the institution unless the property is ordered sold by the district court having jurisdiction of the estate for the reason that the property is likely to deteriorate in value during the time herein specified.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If any real or personal property is sold pursuant to this section, the district court shall order the proceeds of the sale to be invested safely for the benefit of the patient or to be used for the support and maintenance of the patient’s dependents or used to pay the costs of care and treatment of the patient.

The state agency may waive or reduce the immediate payment that is due under a payment plan if the obligor’s current or most recent monthly support obligation is less than five hundred dollars. The state agency may require that a payment plan under this section include satisfaction of all court-ordered child support obligations of the obligor. The obligor’s current or most recent monthly support obligation under section 14-09-09.30 must be considered when determining the duration of a payment plan under this section and the payments due under the agreement. A payment plan under this section is not a modification of any child support obligation of the obligor and does not bar judicial review of a child support order under section 14-09-08.4 or other enforcement actions by the obligee or the state agency.

        The Aid to Families of Dependent Children (AFDC) program is a grant-in-aid program established by the federal government and governed in turn by federal and state statutes and regulations. In this state, county social service boards, in accordance with the rules of the department of human services, have the duty of determining whether an applicant is eligible for AFDC assistance. S.W. v. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs., 420 N.W.2d 344, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        Whether a “parent” is absent from the home is an element of AFDC eligibility. Consequently, determining parentage is incidental and necessary to the performance of the department’s duties, thus, the department, with the written acknowledgments of paternity in hand, was not required to adjudicate paternity in district court under this chapter before it could properly deny the claim for AFDC benefits.

        District court did not err by affirming an administrative enforcement action placing a lien on appellant’s personal property held by the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to pay his past due child support, because the lien was placed under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.35.html#t35c35-34s35-34-06" target="_blank">35-34-06</a></cite>. Appellant had no right to a hearing on his motion for review, because the district court was not required to hold a hearing under N.D.C.C. § 50-09-14(2) and appellant did not request one.

     <p>
      The child support improvement account is established as a special account in the state treasury. Five percent of the total amount of child support incentive payments paid to the state by the office of child support enforcement of the United States department of health and human services must be deposited into the child support improvement account. The funds in the child support improvement account, the balance of the child support incentives account on July 1, 2005, and any matching federal funds received by the state agency are appropriated on a continuing basis for the sole purpose of producing increases in child support collections, federal child support incentives, or other revenue or savings to the state agency, or reductions in unpaid child support, that exceed the total amount of improvement funds expended. Improvement funds may be used to sponsor training and publications that promote child support enforcement activities. The state agency shall develop and maintain a business plan that defines the goals and objectives of the child support enforcement program, identifies methods to increase child support collections or reduce unpaid child support, and outlines the process for evaluating progress toward the goals and objectives in the business plan. The state agency must maintain a record of its use of improvement funds and the anticipated result from the use of the funds. Improvement funds may only be used for activities that are included in the business plan maintained under this section.

    Report of gambling winnings.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Before a gaming operator makes a payment of winnings for which the gaming operator is required to file an internal revenue service form W-2G or substantially equivalent form, the gaming operator shall obtain the name, address, and social security number of the winner and submit the information to the state agency through a secure interactive website that is maintained by the state agency. If the state agency replies to the gaming operator that the winner does not owe past-due support or if the gaming operator is unable to receive information from the state agency after attempting in good faith to do so, the gaming operator may make the payment to the winner. If the state agency replies that the winner owes past-due support, the reply must include the amount of past-due support owed by the winner and the location of the office with which the winner may file a protest under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t50c50-09s50-09-14" target="_self">50-09-14</a></cite>. The gaming operator shall withhold from the payment to the winner an amount equal to the total winnings or the amount of past-due support, whichever is less. Within seven business days after withholding the payment, the gaming operator shall send the amount withheld to the state disbursement unit, along with the name, address, and social security number of the winner. The gaming operator may withhold and retain an additional sum of three dollars from the winner to cover expenses involved in sending the payment. A gaming operator that withholds funds under this section is subject to the same duties and liabilities as an income payer under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.14.html#t14c14-09s14-09-09" target="_blank">14-09-09</a></cite>.3 unless the context indicates otherwise and is immune from suit or liability for complying with this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A facility must promptly provide written notice to the department when a violation noted in a notice of noncompliance is corrected. Upon receipt of written notice by the department, the daily fiscal sanction assessed for the deficiency must stop accruing. The facility must be promptly reinspected. If, upon reinspection, it is determined that the deficiency has not been corrected, the daily assessment of fiscal sanctions must resume and the amount of fiscal sanctions that otherwise would have accrued during the period prior to resumption must be added to the total assessment due from the facility. The department must mail or deliver a notice of resumption to the facility. Recovery of the resumed fiscal sanction must be stayed if the licensee makes a written request for an administrative hearing in the manner provided for in chapter 28-32, provided that the written request for the hearing is made to the department within ten days after mailing or delivery of the notice of resumption.

     <p>
      The department of human services shall issue licenses for the conduct of child-placing agencies upon application. A child-placing agency shall require a criminal history record investigation on the owner and each employee of a child-placing agency who has direct contact with families, with children, or with both. The department of human services shall consider any criminal history record information available about the owner at the time a licensing decision is made and about an employee prior to the owner or the employee having direct contact with families, with children, or with both. Licenses must be granted for a period not exceeding two years. Licenses must be issued to reputable and responsible applicants upon a showing that they, and their agents, are equipped properly by training and experience to find and select suitable temporary or permanent homes for children and to supervise the homes when children are placed in them, to the end that the health, morality, and general well-being of children placed by them will be properly safeguarded. The department of human services may not deny a license because of the applicant’s objection to performing, assisting, counseling, recommending, facilitating, referring, or participating in a placement that violates the applicant’s written religious or moral convictions or policies.

     <p>
      A child-placing agency is not required to perform, assist, counsel, recommend, facilitate, refer, or participate in a placement that violates the agency’s written religious or moral convictions or policies. A state or local government entity may not deny a child-placing agency any grant, contract, or participation in a government program because of the child-placing agency’s objection to performing, assisting, counseling, recommending, facilitating, referring, or participating in a placement that violates the child-placing agency’s written religious or moral convictions or policies. Refusal by a child-placing agency to perform, assist, counsel, recommend, facilitate, refer, or participate in a placement that violates the child-placing agency’s written religious or moral convictions or policies does not constitute a determination that the proposed adoption is not in the best interest of the minor.

      Within the limits of legislative appropriations, medical assistance may be paid for any person who either has income and resources insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical care and services or is eligible for or receiving financial assistance under chapter 50-09 or title XVI of the Social Security Act, as amended, and:

For the purposes of making any determination or redetermination of eligibility, the phrase “assignment or transfer” includes actions or failures to act which effect a renunciation or disclaimer of any interest which the applicant or recipient might otherwise assert or have asserted, or which serve to reduce the amounts which an applicant or recipient might otherwise claim from a decedent’s estate, a trust or similar device, or a person obligated by law to furnish support to the applicant or recipient.

The department may require from any applicant or recipient of medical assistance the assignment of any rights accruing under third-party medical coverage.

        Even though applicant for medical assistance held legal title to pledged certificates and had the legal authority to require her son, to whom she had pledged the certificates as security for a debt, to satisfy the debt himself, the Department of Human Services determined applicant to have a “resource” within the meaning of this section; although title to the certificates of deposit did not pass until they were applied to the debt, the department properly determined an “assignment or transfer” to have taken place at that time. Wagner v. Sheridan County Social Servs. Bd., 518 N.W.2d 724, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature did not expressly make “renunciation” a disqualifying act under subdivision 1 of this section, although it could have easily so provided; nor did it define the terms “assignment” or “transfer”. However, as commonly understood, those terms connoted an act of designating or conveying a thing from one person to another. One who assigned or transferred a property designated the assignee or transferee and the terms of the conveyance. In contrast, one who renounces a bequest or inheritance under former section 30.1-10-01 (see now chapter 30.1-10.1) could not designate the recipient or otherwise control the disposition of the renounced property. Nielsen v. Cass County Social Servs. Bd., 395 N.W.2d 157 (N.D. 1986), decided prior to the 1987 amendment to N.D.C.C. section 50-24.1-02(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        Department of human services’ contention that benefit recipient’s interest in her deceased mother’s estate should be treated as an available resource or that her renunciation of it should be treated as a disqualifying transfer under subdivision 1 of this section was inconsistent with the requirement of former section 30.1-10-01(3) (see now chapter 30.1-10.1) that a renunciation relate back to the death of the decedent “for all purposes”. Nielsen v. Cass County Social Servs. Bd., 395 N.W.2d 157 (N.D. 1986), decided prior to the 1987 amendment to N.D.C.C. section 50-24.1-02(1).

        Renouncing a right to a decedent’s estate is a transfer for purposes of determining eligibility for medical assistance benefits. Hinschberger v. Griggs County Social Servs., 499 N.W.2d 876, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1993).

Admin. Code § 75-02.02.1-31(3) meant that the trust was intended to be used as a primary source of support and maintenance for applicant, making applicant ineligible for medical assistance.

        Assets conveyed by a deceased Medicaid recipient to his wife prior to his death and traceable to her estate were subject to the North Dakota Department of Human Services’ recovery claim; however, claim could not include assets in which deceased recipient never held an interest. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs. v. Caroline (In re Estate of Wirtz), 2000 ND 59, 607 N.W.2d 882, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department was unable to recover funds in CD’s which were part of recipient’s spouse’s estate and in which it could not establish the recipient’s legal interest, given that this section does not authorize recovery of benefits paid from the estate of a recipient’s spouse who predeceases the recipient, nor does it allow for recovery from the estate of a recipient’s spouse who predeceases the recipient beyond assets to which the recipient had legal title or interest. Redfield v. Bitterman, 2000 ND 217, 620 N.W.2d 570, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        State human services department was allowed to trace the assets of Medicaid recipient and to recover the benefits paid to that recipient even when the recipient’s surviving spouse died; accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing the state human services department’s claim against the estate of decedent for Medicaid benefits it provided to her late husband, especially since the late husband transferred the proceeds of an annuity to her to qualify for Medicaid in the first place. Those proceeds were traceable because decedent had transferred them to her two sons upon learning that she was dying of cancer and that the state human services department might have a claim for reimbursement of the Medicaid benefits paid to her late husband.

        District court erred in ruling that the Department of Human Services was entitled to 100 percent of the net sale proceeds from the sale of a decedent’s home to pay for medical assistance benefits previously received by his deceased spouse because the Department’s recovery from a deceased Medicaid recipient’s joint tenancy property was limited to the deceased recipient’s fractional interest in the property.

        It is not significant whether the obligation to repay medical assistance is regarded as a statutory creation, or as being quasi-contractual in nature; in either regard, the obligation to repay, if any, arises upon receipt of the benefits, i.e., prior to the decedent’s death. Although the Department of Human Services’ ability to enforce the claim was tolled until recipient’s death, the obligation was incurred by recipient during her lifetime. Feiner v. Mowbray (In re Estate of Hooey), 521 N.W.2d 85, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>
        Recovery of amounts of 1992 medical assistance benefits from surviving spouse of medical assistance beneficiary was not a retroactive application of the 1995 amendment to the statute; the obligation to repay medical assistance benefits received by the decedent arose when he received the benefits in 1992. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs. v. Thompson, 1998 ND 226, 586 N.W.2d 847, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 1998).

A medical assistance claim that meets the prudent layperson standard of this section may not be denied by the department on the basis that the prehospital emergency medical services were not medically necessary or that a medical emergency did not exist.

       <p>
        Appellant not established it did not receive a fair hearing as the result of inadequate notice of the issues; information about diagnosis, medical necessity, and length of need was submitted, but not on the specific documents required, and thus appellant failed to properly document the claims, and the final decision and audit were consistent in the reason given for denying the claims.

       <p>
        There was no evidence that the department misread or ignored the statute or that it continued to disregard the law despite instruction from the court to the contrary; the department's conduct had not yet risen to the level of systemic disregard of the law and reversal was not warranted as a sanction at this time in this case.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the legislature has directed the Department of Human Services to issue its final decision to conform to the requirements of the Administrative Agencies Practices Act (AAPA), the legislature also provided a procedural process for a review of provider appeals, and the procedure to follow is the more specific procedure; appellant was entitled to be provided with the administrative review provided in the specific statute in this Medicaid overpayment case, and the absence of a hearing in compliance with the AAPA did not require reversal of the Department's determination. St. Alexius Med. Ctr. v. N.D. Dep't of Human Servs., 2018 ND 36, 906 N.W.2d 343, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Seventy-five day time limit is directory, not mandatory, and the Department of Human Services' failure to issue a decision within 75-days does not terminate the Department's subject matter jurisdiction; because the statutory time requirement does not control subject matter jurisdiction, appellant waived the issue by failing to raise it in its specification of errors and before the district court. St. Alexius Med. Ctr. v. N.D. Dep't of Human Servs., 2018 ND 36, 906 N.W.2d 343, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute applies to cases where the Department of Human Resources is seeking recoupment for payments previously made after an audit determined the payment was an overpayment, but it also applies to other cases where a provider's claim has been denied before any payment is made; if the 75-day time period is mandatory, providers may be deprived of review of the Department's prior decision denying payment in cases that do not involve recoupment, which could lead to harsh or unfair consequences, and therefore the statutory time requirement for the Department to issue its final decision is directory. Sanford HealthCare Access., LLC v. N.D. Dep't of Human Servs., 2018 ND 35, 906 N.W.2d 336, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the statutory time requirement is directory, appellant was required to establish actual prejudice, and the district court was required to apply the balancing test to determine whether the department's failure to comply with the time requirement invalidated its final order; in requiring the department to prove good cause for exceeding the time requirement, the district court did not apply the correct test, which was error.

       The department shall notify each resident, and the nursing home in which the resident resides, of the payment classification established under subsection 3. The notice must inform the resident of the classification that was assigned, the opportunity to review the documentation supporting the classification, the opportunity to obtain clarification from the department, and the opportunity to appeal the classification. The notice of resident classification must be sent by first-class mail. The individual resident notices may be sent to the resident’s nursing home for distribution to the resident in which event the nursing home is responsible for the distribution of the notice to the resident and to the resident’s representative, if any. This notice must be distributed to the resident and sent first-class mail or hand-delivered to the resident’s representative within three working days after the nursing home’s receipt of the notice from the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c50-24.4s50-24.4-01.2ol15">
       The resident or the nursing home may appeal the assigned payment classification to the department. The appeal must be submitted in writing to the department within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of resident classification. For appeals submitted by or on behalf of the resident, the time period for submission of the request begins on the date the classification notice is delivered to the resident, or mailed or delivered to the resident’s representative, whichever is latest. The appeal must be accompanied by the name of the resident, the name and address of the nursing home in which the resident resides, the reasons for the appeal, the requested classification changes, and documentation supporting the requested classification. The documentation accompanying the appeal is limited to documentation intended to establish that the needs of the resident, at the time of the assessment resulting in the disputed classification, justify a change of classification.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c50-24.4s50-24.4-01.2ol16">
       Upon written request, the nursing home shall give the resident or the resident’s representative a copy of the assessment form and the other documentation that was given to the department to support the assessment findings. The nursing home shall also provide access to and a copy of other information from the resident’s record that has been requested by or on behalf of the resident to support a resident’s appeal. A copy of any requested material must be provided within three working days of receipt of a written request for the information. Upon request, the nursing home shall assist the resident in preparing an appeal.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c50-24.4s50-24.4-01.2ol17">
       In addition to the information required in subsection 5, an appeal by a nursing home must be accompanied by the following information: the date the resident payment classification notices were received by the nursing home; the date the classification notices were distributed to the resident or the resident’s representative; and a copy of a notice of appeal sent to the resident or to the resident’s representative. This notice must tell the resident or the resident’s representative that the resident’s classification is being appealed, the reason for the appeal, that the resident’s rate will change if the appeal is approved by the department and the extent of the change, that copies of the nursing home’s appeal and supporting documentation are available for review, and that the resident also has the right to appeal. If the nursing home fails to provide this information with the appeal, the appeal must be denied, and the nursing home may not make further appeals concerning that specific resident payment classification until such time as the resident’s payment classification is re-established by the department.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c50-24.4s50-24.4-01.2ol18">
       The appeal determination of the department must be made by individuals not involved in reviewing the assessment that established the disputed classification. The appeal determination must be based upon the initial assessment and upon the information provided to the department under subsection 5. If the department determines that it is necessary for the appeal determination, it may conduct onsite reviews. Within fifteen working days of receiving the appeal, the department shall affirm or modify the original resident classification. The original classification must be modified if the department determines that the assessment resulting in the classification did not accurately reflect the needs of the resident at the time of the assessment. The resident and the nursing home must be notified within five working days after the decision is made.
      </li>
      <li id="t50c50-24.4s50-24.4-01.2ol19">
       The appeal determination under subsection 8 is the final administrative decision of the agency. That decision is subject to appeal to the district court, and for that purpose, the decision must be treated as a decision on a petition for rehearing made pursuant to section 28-32-40. Appeal to the district court must be taken in the manner required by section 28-32-42.

        Under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-05(1), reasonable force used to safeguard or promote the child’s welfare, including punishment and discipline, may not provide the basis for a finding that a child was an abused child under N.D.C.C. § 50-25.1-02(3); the father failed to clearly demonstrate that the child abuse statutes were unconstitutionally overbroad.

        A reasonable person could not find probable cause that defendants abused their children where there was no evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude any of the children ever suffered serious physical harm or traumatic abuse as a result of the parents’ spankings. Raboin v. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs., 552 N.W.2d 329, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no finding of serious physical harm resulting in negative changes in children’s health or of traumatic emotional abuse on the part of daycare owners, where there was no evidence of bruising, marks, or other physical manifestations of abuse, although the evidence showed the daycare owners struck children with their hands, called the children names and told them they were too big to cry, argued in front of the children, and limited children’s use of toilet paper. Walton v. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs., 552 N.W.2d 336, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasoning mind reasonably could determine the Department of Human Services finding that the father willfully inflicted an impairment of physical condition, including physical pain, upon the child was proven by the weight of the evidence from the entire record as there was evidence that the father struck the child approximately 24 times over a two-hour period with a wooden backscratcher, and although administered through a pair of pants and a diaper, the force of the spankings caused two large purple bruises the size of fifty-cent pieces on the child’s buttocks; there was evidence, including admissions from the father, that the child cried each time he was spanked and that the spankings were causing pain to the child.

       <p>
        Reasoning mind reasonably could determine the Department of Human Services’
   finding that the force the father used was not reasonable force was proven by the weight of the evidence from the entire record; his use of force was therefore not justified under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-05(1) and did not preclude a finding that the child was an abused child under N.D.C.C. § 50-25.1-02(3).

       All persons mandated or permitted to report cases of known or suspected child abuse or neglect immediately shall cause oral or written reports to be made to the department or authorized agent. Oral reports must be followed by written reports within forty-eight hours if so requested by the department or authorized agent. A requested written report must include information specifically sought by the department or authorized agent if the reporter possesses or has reasonable access to that information.

       The chief administrator of an entity employing more than twenty-five individuals who are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect under this chapter may designate an agent within the entity to file reports of suspected child abuse or neglect on behalf of the staff members and volunteers of the entity. Under no circumstances may a designated agent to whom such report has been made impose conditions, including prior approval or prior notification, upon a staff member or volunteer reporting suspected child abuse or neglect under this chapter or exercise any control, restraint, or modification, or make any changes to the information provided by the staff member or volunteer. A report filed by the designated agent must include the first and last name, title, and contact information for every staff member or volunteer of the entity who is believed to have direct knowledge of the facts surrounding the report. A single report from the designated agent under this subsection is adequate to meet the reporting requirement on behalf of staff members and volunteers of the entity listed with the required information.

However, this section does not preclude the staff member or volunteer from also reporting the suspected child abuse and neglect directly to the department or authorized agent. A staff member or volunteer reporting suspected child abuse or neglect under this subsection who has knowledge the designated agent has failed to report on behalf of the staff member or volunteer immediately shall make a report directly to the department or authorized agent.

      <p>
       The statutory abrogation of the doctor-patient privilege by this section is not applicable where a petition for termination of parental rights alleges deprivation pursuant to section 27-20-44. Dasovick v. A.B (In re R.D.S.), 259 N.W.2d 636, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 1977).

      <p>
       N.D.C.C. § 50-25.1-10 abrogates the privilege in N.D. R. Evid. 503 in cases involving reports of alleged child abuse or neglect even when the termination petition alleges N.D.C.C. ch. 27-20 as a basis for the action. Berger v. F.O. (In the Interest of R.O.), 2001 ND 137, 631 N.W.2d 159, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 2001).

      <p>
       To the extent that Interest of R.D.S., 259 N.W.2d 636 (1977), attempts to distinguish allegations of deprivation from allegations of neglect for purposes of abrogating privileged communications, the North Dakota Supreme Court holds that the distinction is one without a difference.
