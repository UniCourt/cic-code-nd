Whenever a drug is recognized in both the United States pharmacopoeia and the homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States it is subject to the requirements of the United States pharmacopoeia unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homeopathic drug, in which case it is subject to the provisions of the homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States and not to those of the United States pharmacopoeia.

If the prescription is created electronically by the prescriber, the required legend must appear on the practitioner’s screen. The practitioner must take a specific overt action to include the “brand medically necessary” language with the electronic transmission. The pharmacist shall note the instructions on the file copy of the prescription, or maintain the digital record as transmitted if it is an electronic prescription. A reminder legend must be placed on all prescription forms or appear on the computer screen of the electronic prescribing system. The legend must state “In order to require that a brand name product be dispensed, the practitioner must handwrite the words ‘brand medically necessary’.”. The legend printed on the prescription form or appearing on the prescriber’s computer screen must be in at least six-point uppercase print or font. The pharmacist may not substitute a generic name drug product unless its price to the purchaser is less than the price of the prescribed drug product. In addition, a pharmacist may not substitute drug products in the following dosage forms: enteric coated tablets, controlled release products, injectable suspensions other than antibiotics, suppositories containing active ingredients for which systemic absorption is necessary for therapeutic activity, and different delivery systems for aerosol and nebulizer drugs. In the event that any drug listed above is, subsequent to January 1, 1982, determined to be therapeutically equivalent, then the previously mentioned substitution ban is automatically removed for that drug. The pharmacist shall inform the person receiving the drug when a prescription for a brand name drug product does not require that the prescribed drug be dispensed and of the person’s right to refuse a generic name drug product selected by the pharmacist. The pharmacy file copy of every prescription must include the brand name, if any, or the name of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor of the generic name drug dispensed. A pharmacist who selects and dispenses a therapeutically equivalent generic name drug product shall assume no greater liability for selecting the dispensed drug product than would be incurred in filling a prescription for a drug product prescribed by its generic name. The practitioner is not liable for the substitution made by a pharmacist.

       North Dakota legislation was preempted because it related to ERISA plans by regulating the conduct of pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) administering or managing pharmacy benefits; North Dakota provided no argument as to which provisions might be saved by the savings clause, and North Dakota has waived this issue.

        This chapter is not unconstitutional on grounds that it makes an unreasonable classification by placing marijuana in the same schedule as opium, heroin, and LSD, or violates equal protection or due process, or grants a special privilege or immunity to users of tobacco and alcohol which it denies users of marijuana.

       <p>
        Controlled substance charges against defendant under N.D.C.C. ch. 19-03.1 were properly dismissed because the North Dakota Board of Pharmacy did not substantially comply with the notice requirement under former N.D.C.C. § 28-32-03(5) and did not take sufficient measures to make the emergency interim final rule in N.D. Admin. Code ch. 61-13-01 known to the public at large.
   State v. Nickel, 2011 ND 200, 806 N.W.2d 155, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in entering an order dismissing with prejudice felony charges of possession with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance because the district court abused its discretion by determining manufacturing required evidence of producing controlled substances for a third party as the transformation of raw marijuana to hash oil was more than preparation or compounding for individual use, thereby permitting a finding of manufacturing under the acts proscribed by this statute; and the State met the burden of proving probable cause with respect to the possession with intent to deliver charge as the language used by the district court indicated a misapplication of the legal standard for a preliminary hearing.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to establish substance as marijuana where a state chemist, after conducting several tests to determine botanical characteristics of substance, testified that tests established substance to be marijuana; fact that state chemist had not tested for Tetrahydrocannabinols level, or potency or harmful effects of substance was irrelevant. State v. Weisz, 356 N.W.2d 462, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 399</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definitions of “manufacture” and “production” should be read and construed together. Manufacturing embraces production, and production embraces manufacturing and planting, cultivation, growing or harvesting. Reading these two definitions together, it becomes apparent that the legislature intended to prohibit the growing of marijuana. State v. Padgett, 393 N.W.2d 754, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 413</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The presence of marijuana seeds in a garbage bag, which also contained bank deposit slips bearing defendant’s name, would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe there was probably more marijuana inside his home, and the fact that the seeds were not capable of germination, or might have been derived from a package of birdseed, could be significant to trial, but was not crucial to a finding of probable cause. State v. Johnson, 531 N.W.2d 275, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecuting attorney’s statement in support of an appeal of the order granting defendant’s motion to suppress did not satisfy the requirements of
   N.D.C.C. § 29-28-07(5), because it did not explain the need for the suppressed evidence to proceed with the charge of unlawful possession of a controlled substance—marijuana as defined by former N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-01(17). The trial court did not suppress evidence found in plain view of a metal cleaning rod on a bedside table with burned marijuana residue, and defendant told the officers all drugs found in the bedroom belonged to her.
   State v. Peterson, 2011 ND 109, 799 N.W.2d 67, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant’s convictions for possession of marijuana and delivery of marijuana, where marijuana and purchase money were found in a bag containing clothes, the bag was found in an apartment, and defendant had access to the apartment. A jury could draw a reasonable inference that the bag belonged to defendant.
   State v. Montano, 2012 ND 59, 813 N.W.2d 612, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 2012).

        Although there may be some scientific basis to the argument that cocaine is not pharmacologically a narcotic drug, legislative classification of cocaine as a narcotic and schedule II drug for control and penalty purposes is constitutional. State v. Kainz, 321 N.W.2d 478, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 299</cite> (N.D. 1982); State v. Lind, 322 N.W.2d 826, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 366</cite> (N.D. 1982).

        Defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence of drugs was supported by the evidence because, applying the definition of “drug” in former N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-01(13), the statutory language regulating driving under the influence of drugs included over-the-counter medications should they impair an individual’s ability to drive safely.

        Denial of post-conviction relief was proper, because an administrative rule delineated JWH-018 1-Pentyl-3 (1-naphthoyl) indole (JWH-018) as a prohibited controlled substance when petitioner committed the alleged acts, the administrative rule had force and effect of law upon becoming effective, and subsequent codification of JWH-018 as a prohibited controlled substance did not invalidate the effect of the final administrative rule.

        Denial of post-conviction relief was proper, because an administrative rule delineated JWH-018 1-Pentyl-3 (1-naphthoyl) indole (JWH-018) as a prohibited controlled substance when petitioner committed the alleged acts, the administrative rule had force and effect of law upon becoming effective, and subsequent codification of JWH-018 as a prohibited controlled substance did not invalidate the effect of the final administrative rule.

        Classifying marijuana as a schedule I drug does not constitute an arbitrary nor irrational classification in violation of Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection and due process. State v. Ennis, 334 N.W.2d 827, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 423</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 992, 104 S. Ct. 484, 78 L. Ed. 2d 681, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 2474 (U.S. 1983).

        In a case involving two defendants who were convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to admit defendants' medical marijuana prescriptions from the State of Washington as a lawful defense under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act.

        Although there may be some scientific basis to the argument that cocaine is not pharmacologically a narcotic drug, legislative classification of cocaine as a narcotic drug and schedule II drug for control and penalty purposes is constitutional.

        Finding that an amendment to N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-23(5) did not apply at the time of sentencing was error because as ameliorating penal legislation, it applied retroactively, and because his right to appeal had not been exhausted before the statute’s effective date, appellant had not been finally convicted. State v. Cook, 2018 ND 100, 910 N.W.2d 179, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        Where the defendant's criminal purpose was clearly demonstrated; he had gone as far as he could in implementing that purpose; and, as a result, his dangerousness was plainly manifested, he could not escape prosecution because he clumsily used the wrong brand of inhaler in attempting to manufacture a methamphetamine isomer. State v. Erban, 429 N.W.2d 408, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1988)
       </p>
       <p>
        If the substance intended to be manufactured was not controlled, it would have had a clear impact on the verdict and conviction would be a serious injustice; one cannot be convicted of attempt to manufacture a controlled substance if the intended substance is not controlled, therefore the issue whether the intended substance is controlled can be reviewed although not raised in trial court. State v. Erban, 429 N.W.2d 408, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of criminal attempt to manufacture methamphetamine because (1) an agent with a narcotics task force testified that defendant possessed two prepared precursors of methamphetamine - cold pills and anhydrous ammonia; (2) those two of the six required chemical components of methamphetamine were the most difficult elements of methamphetamine to obtain, because each was regulated by state law; (3) although he still needed the over-the-counter items to complete the manufacturing process, the agent testified that defendant possessed enough of each of those two ingredients to manufacture methamphetamine; and (4) methamphetamine residue was found on a coffee filter found in defendant’s vehicle.

        Despite the State’s failure to allege in the information the prior offenses upon which it was relying to satisfy (1)(a)(3) of this section, defendant’s conviction was not reversed because the irregularity did not affect a substantial right where defendant had actual knowledge that the State intended to use prior Minnesota convictions to seek the mandatory minimum sentence when he received certified copies of the record relating to his prior convictions during discovery. State v. Mora, 2000 ND 179, 617 N.W.2d 478, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 2000).

       <p>
        Where the jury instructions, as a whole, adequately advised the jury of the law, and there would have been no confusion as to the person to whom the controlled substance was delivered, any error in the jury instructions was harmless. State v. Raywalt, 444 N.W.2d 688, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant, who claimed her intoxication negated the culpability requirement of “willfully,” objected to the court giving any intoxication instruction, the defendant did not propose additional or more detailed instructions, and could not predicate error on the court’s failure to more fully instruct. State v. Barnes, 551 N.W.2d 279, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no relevant evidence upon which a jury could find defendant was so intoxicated as to negate the culpability element of the crime, and a defendant is entitled to an instruction based on a legal defense only if there is evidence to support it. State v. Barnes, 551 N.W.2d 279, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Trial court properly instructed the jury as to the essential elements of the offense of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver; because the Michlitsch affirmative defense jury instruction no longer applies to this section it could not have been ineffective assistance of counsel for defendant’s attorney not to have requested the instruction. State v. Bell, 2002 ND 130, 649 N.W.2d 243, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        In a case involving two defendants who were convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to admit defendants' medical marijuana prescriptions from the State of Washington as a lawful defense under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act. State v. Kuruc, 2014 ND 95, 846 N.W.2d 314, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 2014)

        Although the penalty for possession of less than one-half ounce, or 14.175 grams, of marijuana had been reduced to an infraction offense, because an infraction was a criminal offense, the officer detected an odor of raw marijuana emanating from the interior of the vehicle during the traffic stop, and the officer was trained in identifying the odor of marijuana in its raw and burnt form, there was probable cause to believe criminal activity was afoot, and to deny defendant’s motion to suppress. State v. Bolme, 2020 ND 255, 952 N.W.2d 75, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 258</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       <p>
        In both offenses of simple possession of a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, the state is not required to prove the accused had knowledge of the presence of the drug or knowledge of the identity of the drug. State v. Morris, 331 N.W.2d 48, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 243</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>

        Possession of a controlled substance may be actual or constructive, exclusive or joint, and may be shown entirely by circumstantial evidence; constructive possession requires proof that accused had the power and capability to exercise dominion and control over the controlled substance, and can be inferred from the totality of circumstances associated with a particular case.

        There was corroborating evidence to support the testimony of an accomplice in a drug case where police found clothes apparently belonging to defendant at a residence where an alleged assault occurred and drugs were found; moreover, the damage to the residence and the blood evidence found further supported the victim’s story that a violent incident involving defendant had occurred. The evidence placing defendant at the scene was sufficient to connect him with the drugs found under the doctrine of constructive possession; therefore, he was properly convicted of possession of methamphetamine with intent to manufacture, possession of drug paraphernalia for use with methamphetamine, and possession of methamphetamine.

        Sentence of ten years, with four years suspended and five years of supervised probation, for defendant’s conviction of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance was affirmed because defendant’s sentence was within the range of sentences for a Class A Felony, and defendant failed to show that the district court substantially relied upon an impermissible factor in sentencing; the trial court determined defendant was engaged in an ongoing enterprise of selling drugs and this was a reasonable inference based upon the evidence in the record and was a factor the trial court could consider during sentencing, and the trial court also considered at least seven other factors in sentencing defendant, all of which were listed in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.12.1.html#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04" target="_blank">12.1-32-04</a></cite>.

        Defendant’s conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver was not subject to enhancement under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-23" target="_self">19-03.1-23</a></cite>.1(1)(a) as this statute provided an offense enhancement only for the manufacture and distribution of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school. The inclusion of manufacture and distribution in this provision implied that possession with intent to deliver was excluded. Furthermore, possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver could not have “involved” distribution of a controlled substance by the defendant, because the defendant had not yet distributed it; instead, only circumstances that indicated an intent to deliver the controlled substance existed.

       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction and sentence under N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-23(1)(a) was reversed as the trial court should not have required his prior cocaine-related conviction to be admitted at trial because, under N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-23(1)(a)(1), one prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver enhances a defendant’s sentence, but it does not enhance the offense from a class A felony to a more serious class and a prior conviction that enhances a sentence, but not the seriousness of the offense, is generally not regarded as an element of the offense; thus, Apprendi did not require the prior conviction be proved “beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury”. Furthermore, it was ineffective assistance for defense counsel to succumb to the trial court’s misunderstanding of Apprendi and to stipulate to sending the prior conviction to the jury; admission of that evidence constituted prejudicial and reversible error.

       <p>
        Defendant’s sentence was properly enhanced to a 20-year mandatory minimum under N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-23(1) because although defendant was convicted of three prior offenses all on the same date, defendant was convicted of those offenses before the criminal conduct before the court occurred; the convictions did not have to all be sequential.

That is not to say, however, a court would not consider an “equivalent” offense as contemplated under this section because the court must still find “extenuating or mitigating circumstances” to justify any suspension of a sentence; a district court's analysis could still include consideration of a defendant's “equivalent” convictions in any other state or federal jurisdiction.

        In a case in which defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, the district court's denial of defendant's motion to strike his 20-year mandatory minimum sentence did not amount to obvious error.

        Defendant’s two prior convictions for delivery of marijuana clearly qualified as prior violations of N.D.C.C. ch. 19-03.1, and under the plain meaning of this section defendant was subject to the mandatory minimum 20-year sentence of imprisonment.

        A spouse does not forfeit all rights to the marital home, including the “common authority” to consent to a search there, when driven out by domestic violence; spouse still possessed “common authority” over farmstead, and validly consented to warrantless search that discovered marijuana. State v. Huffman, 542 N.W.2d 718, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an officer told defendant that he would accompany him to the back of the apartment, defendant’s failure to object did not amount to a consent to search, and the consent given after defendant was in handcuffs was not valid because the arrest was based on improperly obtained evidence. Therefore, his conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver was reversed. State v. Mitzel, 2004 ND 157, 685 N.W.2d 120, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 286</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        Officers’ testimony about feared destruction of evidence, upon which they based their right to enter a home without a warrant, was nothing more than speculation and did not demonstrate exigent circumstances that would overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries.

      <p>
       On appeal from conviction of selling marijuana, contention that transaction did not constitute a “sale” was without merit since the word, as used in chapter on narcotics violations, was broader in scope than definition usually given to it; consequently, transfer of marijuana and money between defendant and another constituted a “sale” within the chapter.

        Defendant’s conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver was not subject to enhancement under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-23" target="_self">19-03.1-23</a></cite>.1(1)(a) as this statute provided an offense enhancement only for the manufacture and distribution of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school. The inclusion of manufacture and distribution in this provision implied that possession with intent to deliver was excluded. Furthermore, possession of a controlled substance with the intent to deliver could not have “involved” distribution of a controlled substance by the defendant, because the defendant had not yet distributed it; instead, only circumstances that indicated an intent to deliver the controlled substance existed.

       Since the property owner involved in a currency forfeiture case did not raise an issue in the trial court about the applicability of presumptions in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-23" target="_self">19-03.1-23</a></cite>.3 regarding forfeiture, the property owner could not raise the issue for the first time on appeal. Even so, the trial court’s findings supporting forfeiture were not clearly erroneous and, thus, the forfeiture had to be upheld.

      An individual is immune from criminal prosecution under sections <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-22" target="_self">19-03.1-22</a></cite>.1, <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t19c19-03.1s19-03.1-22" target="_self">19-03.1-22</a></cite>.3, 19-03.1-22.5, subsection 7 of section 19-03.1-23, subsection 3 of section 19-03.2-03, and section 19-03.4-03 if in good faith that individual seeks medical assistance for another individual in need of emergency medical assistance due to a drug overdose. To receive immunity under this section, the individual receiving immunity must have remained on the scene until assistance arrived, cooperated with the medical treatment of the reported drug overdosed individual, and the overdosed individual must have been in a condition a layperson would reasonably believe to be a drug overdose requiring immediate medical assistance. Neither the individual who experiences a drug-related overdose and is in need of emergency medical assistance nor the cooperating individual seeking medical assistance may be charged or prosecuted for the criminal offenses listed in this section or for the sharing of controlled substances among those present. Immunity from prosecution under this section does not apply unless the evidence for the charge or prosecution was obtained as a result of the drug-related overdose and the need for emergency medical assistance. Good faith does not include seeking medical assistance during the course of the execution of an arrest warrant or search warrant or during a lawful search.

        Conviction for illegal possession of narcotic drugs was reversed, where evidence used in conviction was acquired through use of search warrant based on defective information charging burglary; the evidence was inadmissible because it was acquired during unlawful search in violation of the United States Constitution and Art. I, § 18 of the state constitution of 1889 (see now
   N.D. Const., art. I, § 8).

        Trial court’s determination that all of the issues the petitioner raised in his application for postconviction relief had already been raised in his previous appeal was error, because the petitioner’s claims of ineffective assistance of his trial and appellate counsel had never been addressed, and the merit of the petitioner’s claim, that had counsel raised the issue of lack of probable cause to support a nighttime search there was a reasonable probability the evidence against him would have been suppressed, was never considered.

        Mere allegations that drugs are present cannot automatically result in the issuance of a no-knock warrant. State v. Herrick, 1997 ND 155, 567 N.W.2d 336, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence obtained in drug search made under an invalid no-knock warrant was admissible under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule where sheriff’s deputy acted on information that defendant was selling drugs from the apartment and had a weapon, evidence of drugs was found in defendant’s garbage, and legal precedent at the time of the search permitted the per-se issuance of no-knock drug search warrants. State v. Hughes, 1999 ND 24, 589 N.W.2d 912, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 846, 120 S. Ct. 119, 145 L. Ed. 2d 101, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 5434 (U.S. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that defendant may have had a firearm was insufficient by itself to provide probable cause for a no-knock entry, but only the no-knock aspect of the search warrant was invalid, not the search warrant as a whole; and as the officer functionally excised its invalid portion by knocking and announcing his entry, suppression of evidence seized in the search was not required. State v. Roth, 2004 ND 23, 674 N.W.2d 495, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        The police officer’s reasonable belief that the defendant would destroy drug evidence if officers knocked before entering was insufficient to support issuance of a no-knock warrant without particularized information about the type of drugs at issue and their disposability; the information was particular enough, however, to defeat the conclusion that the warrant was issued on a per se basis. State v. Utvick, 2004 ND 36, 675 N.W.2d 387, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 2004).

         Probable Cause.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Probable cause is required for issuance of a no-knock warrant under this section. State v. Herrick, 1997 ND 155, 567 N.W.2d 336, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Searches conducted pursuant to a no-knock warrant issued on a per se basis where the presence of drugs was suspected, prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in State v. Herrick, 1997 ND 155, 567 N.W.2d 336 (1997) (“Herrick I”), are subject to the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. State v. Herrick, 1999 ND 1, 588 N.W.2d 846, 76 N.D. L. Rev. 123 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        No probable cause existed to issue a no-knock drug search warrant where police officer failed to allege that she believed drugs might be quickly disposed of, and the mere mention of a handgun in the defendant’s apartment was insufficient to establish probable cause that knocking and announcing would endanger police officers or others. State v. Hughes, 1999 ND 24, 589 N.W.2d 912, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 846, 120 S. Ct. 119, 145 L. Ed. 2d 101, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 5434 (U.S. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Extensive evidence of drug activity and gun possession contained in 26-page affidavit supporting warrant request was sufficient to establish probable cause for issuance of a no-knock drug search warrant. State v. Johnson, 1999 ND 33, 590 N.W.2d 192, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable cause is not established for a no-knock search warrant where the reviewing court is given information indicating nothing more than probable cause that an easily disposable drug is located in a suspect’s residence. State v. Van Beek, 1999 ND 53, 591 N.W.2d 112, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an officer-affiant vouched for a confidential informant’s reliability and veracity, the informant had provided reliable information about drug traffickers in the past, and supplied detailed information about defendant’s manufacture of methamphetamine, the fact that the information was old was not fatal, since it indicated ongoing criminal activity involving defendant and supported a finding of probable cause for issuance of a search warrant. State v. Roth, 2004 ND 23, 674 N.W.2d 495, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2004).

         A district judge within a district judge’s jurisdiction, and upon proper oath or affirmation showing probable cause, may issue warrants for the purpose of conducting administrative inspections authorized by this chapter or rules hereunder and seizures of property appropriate to the inspections.

The inventory must be made in the presence of the person executing the warrant and of the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, if present, or in the presence of at least one credible person other than the person executing the warrant.

        Offender was entitled to summary judgment against the State because the State did not support the State’s position with competent admissible evidence showing there was probable cause to believe the currency in question was forfeitable property, so the State did not make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to the State’s case and on which the State bore the burden of proof at a hearing.

       Because district court erred in its due process analysis of whether a claimant’s due process rights had been violated by a delay in the forfeiture of items seized as evidence for his criminal trial and because findings of fact were inadequate to provide an understanding of the basis used to reach its decision that the State had probable cause to bring the forfeiture action, case was remanded for a new hearing at which the court, after reviewing all the evidence, must then specifically find facts as to whether there was probable cause for the forfeiture action and whether, by a preponderance of the evidence, the cash at issue was proceeds of a criminal offense.

       Given the extensive evidence at the property owner’s residence that the property owner was involved in the manufacture and possession of marijuana, as well as the sale of that marijuana, the State showed that probable cause existed for it to forfeit the $44,140 in currency that it found during the execution of a search warrant there, as required by

      When property described in subsection 1 of section 19-03.1-36 is to be forfeited, other than property described in subsection 6 of section 19-03.1-36, and in the absence of a written consent to forfeiture, forfeiture proceedings must be commenced by the filing of a summons and complaint for forfeiture of the property in the district court of the county in which the property was seized, is being held, or is located. In the case of real property, the summons and complaint must be filed in the county in which the real property, or some part of the real property, is located. The proceedings must be brought in the name of the state. The complaint must describe the property, state its location, state its present custodian, state the name of each owner if known, state the name of each party with a legal interest in the property if known or of legal record, allege the essential elements of the violation that is claimed to exist, and must conclude with a prayer to enforce the forfeiture. Notice of the forfeiture proceedings must be given to each known owner and known person with a legal interest in the property to be forfeited by serving a copy of the summons and complaint in accordance with the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. The procedure governing the proceedings, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, is the same as that prescribed for civil proceedings.

       <p>
        State laboratory report certified by Director of State Department of Health and prepared by chemist, is hearsay as defined by N.D.R.Ev. 801(c), because it contains statements made by a nontestifying declarant which were offered as proof of the truth of the matter asserted, more particularly, that the substance taken from defendant was illegal. However subsection 4 of this section makes a certified copy of a state laboratory analytical report, for purposes of prosecutions under N.D.C.C. ch. 19-03.1, prima facie evidence of the results of the report’s findings, and constitutes an express statutory exception to the hearsay rule. State v. Fischer, 459 N.W.2d 818, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Defendants’
   right to confrontation was not violated by the admission of a state crime laboratory report on the ground that the report was a testimonial statement under the holding of Crawford—that the admission of out-of-court testimonial statements in criminal cases is precluded, unless, when the witness is unavailable to testify, the accused has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant—because under N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-37(5), defendants could have subpoenaed the laboratory report’s author but failed to do so and there was no evidence that the forensic scientist was unavailable.

      A court shall impose as a condition of release or bail that an individual who has been arrested upon a felony violation of this chapter or chapter 19-03.4 not use a controlled substance without a valid prescription from a licensed medical practitioner and that the individual submit to a medical examination or other reasonable random testing for the purpose of determining the person’s use of a controlled substance. The court shall order the frequency of the random testing and the location at which random testing must occur. The court shall provide notice to the selected provider of the required examination or testing. The provider shall notify the court if the individual fails to appear for the examination or testing. The testing must be at the individual’s own cost. Submission of an individual to a medical examination or other reasonable random testing as a condition for release is not required if the court makes a specific finding on the record that:

        Although a trooper might not have been certain that defendant’s syringes were for drug use, when combined with the butane lighters, they were enough to warrant a belief that they might be drug paraphernalia and evidence of drug activity; based on the presence of butane lighters and syringes that the trooper saw on the front passenger’s seat, both known by the trooper to be used for drug production and use, and defendant’s statements, a reasonable person in the trooper’s position would have concluded that there was probable cause to search defendant’s vehicle.

        Subsection (2) of this section deals with relevance of prior drug convictions rather than their admissibility; therefore, in determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia, the trial court must employ the balancing test of N.D.R.Ev. 403 to determine whether the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. State v. Raywalt, 436 N.W.2d 234, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        N.D.C.C. § 19-03.4-02 is not inconsistent with the rules of evidence. Rather, in applying N.D.C.C. § 19-03.4-02, district courts must apply N.D.R.Ev. 403 and 404.

       <p>
        District court erred in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss a charge for unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia as a class C felony second offense as he did not have a prior conviction for enhancement purposes because a deferred imposition of sentence for a prior charge for unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia resulted in a dismissal of that charge; and the State could not use the prior dismissed deferred imposition of sentence to enhance the charge against defendant.

        A defendant who was found with a recipe for manufacturing methamphetamine in his jacket pocket, who had a recent conviction for delivery of methamphetamine, and who admitted to arresting officers that he and two others intended to set up a drug lab to manufacture methamphetamine, was properly convicted of possession of drug paraphernalia. State v. Raywalt, 436 N.W.2d 234, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support convictions for possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana with intent to deliver where police were informed that defendant, who was wanted in connection with another drug offense, was staying at a motel, defendant was found in the hallway, defendant’s wife was found inside of the room where drugs, cash, and paraphernalia were found during a search warrant’s execution, and the amount of drugs and the way they were packaged were inconsistent with personal use.
   State v. Myers, 2006 ND 242, 724 N.W.2d 168, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was corroborating evidence to support the testimony of an accomplice in a drug case where police found clothes apparently belonging to defendant at a residence where an alleged assault occurred and drugs were found; moreover, the damage to the residence and the blood evidence found further supported the victim’s story that a violent incident involving defendant had occurred. The evidence placing defendant at the scene was sufficient to connect him with the drugs found under the doctrine of constructive possession; therefore, he was properly convicted of possession of methamphetamine with intent to manufacture, possession of drug paraphernalia for use with methamphetamine, and possession of methamphetamine.

        Evidence, including officers finding the drug paraphernalia in a woman’s purse inside defendant’s house in a bedroom that she shared with her boyfriend, the purse being inside a dresser drawer that contained women’s undergarments, and defendant stating that the pipe would be the only thing that officers would find when they found a glass pipe in the purse, was sufficient to convict defendant of possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t19c19-03.4s19-03.4-03" target="_self">19-03.4-03</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Circumstantial evidence that pen barrels used for cocaine, which tested positive for the drug, were found in defendant’s night stand and in a common area in the house where defendant lived provided sufficient evidence to convict defendant of possession of a controlled substance, N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-23(7), and possession of drug paraphernalia, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t19c19-03.4s19-03.4-03" target="_self">19-03.4-03</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        District court, in a bench trial, properly found defendant guilty of possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia because law enforcement relied on an Ohio search warrant in good faith by checking its validity numerous times, circumstantial evidence provided proof of defendant’s intent to use paraphernalia where he hindered law enforcement’s efforts to pat down his leg, and when the object was found, first said the object in his sock was a knife, and then admitted it was a methamphetamine pipe, the pipe tested positive for methamphetamine, defendant was a known drug user.

         Suppression of Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Prosecuting attorney’s statement in support of an appeal of the order granting defendant’s motion to suppress did not satisfy the requirements of N.D.C.C. § 29-28-07(5), because it did not explain the need for the suppressed evidence. The State could proceed with the charge of possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of N.D.C.C. § 19-03.4-03 using the non-suppressed evidence, because the trial court did not suppress evidence found in plain view of a metal cleaning rod on a bedside table with burned marijuana residue, and defendant told the officers all drugs and drug paraphernalia found in the bedroom belonged to her.

       A finding of overpayment or underpayment may be based only on the actual overpayment or underpayment and not on a projection based on the number of patients served having a similar diagnosis or on the number of similar orders or refills for similar drugs. A calculation of an overpayment may not include dispensing fees, unless a prescription was not dispensed or the prescriber denied authorization. In the case of an error that has no financial harm to the patient or plan, the pharmacy benefits manager may not assess any chargeback. The entity conducting the audit may not use extrapolation in calculating the recoupment or penalties for audits. Any recoupment may not be deducted against future remittances and must be invoiced to the pharmacy for payment. An entity performing an audit may not receive payment based on a percentage of the amount recovered. Interest may not accrue during the audit period, which begins with the notice of audit and ends with the final audit report.

      The department may require manufacturers, importers, jobbers, or other retailers to furnish suitable samples to the department for inspection and chemical analysis. If any beverage does not meet all requirements of law, the department shall refuse to license the beverage and shall prevent sale of the beverage. The license fee must be paid annually during the month of December or before placing the beverage on the market. The license expires December thirty-first next following its issuance. If the manufacturer or jobber secures a license for a product, subsequent sellers, including retailers and dispensers, need not again secure a license for the same product, and no dispenser may be required to secure a license for a product prepared for the dispenser’s own use from a product already licensed. The department may adopt rules establishing the amount and the procedures for the collection of annual license fees. License fees collected pursuant to this section must be deposited in the department’s operating fund in the state treasury and any expenditure from the fund is subject to appropriation by the legislative assembly.

The department shall publish notice of any such hearing at least ten days prior thereto. Whenever the department has reason to believe that such shortage no longer exists, the department shall hold a public hearing, after at least ten days’ notice has been given, at which any interested person may present evidence, and the department shall make findings based upon the evidence so presented.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The department shall issue and enforce a written or printed “stop-sale use or removal” order to the owner or custodian of any hazardous substance when the department finds that the product is being offered or exposed for sale in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, and the order must direct that the product must be held at a designated place until the provisions of this chapter have been complied with and the product is released in writing by the department. However, the owner or custodian of such product has the right to appeal from such order to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county where the product is found, praying for a judgment as to the justification of the order, and for the discharge of the product from the order prohibiting the sale in accordance with the findings of the court. The provisions of this section may not be construed as limiting the right of the enforcement officer to proceed as authorized by other provisions of this chapter. The department shall release the hazardous substance held under any “stop-sale use or removal” order when the requirements of this chapter have been complied with and upon payment of all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such order. When the department issues and enforces a “stop-sale use or removal” order against any hazardous substance declared in violation of this chapter, in possession of any dealer or distributor, such dealer or distributor may return to the person from whom such hazardous substance was purchased all unbroken retail containers affected by such order and such person shall reimburse the dealer or distributor for the full purchase price, including all delivery costs. Any hazardous substance found not to be in compliance with this chapter is subject to seizure on complaint of the department to a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which the product is located. In the event the court finds that the hazardous substance is in violation of the provisions of this chapter and orders the condemnation of the product, it must be disposed of in any manner consistent with the character of the hazardous substance and the laws of the state. In no instance may the disposition of the hazardous substance be ordered by the court without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for the release of the product or for permission to process or relabel the product to bring it into compliance with this chapter.
