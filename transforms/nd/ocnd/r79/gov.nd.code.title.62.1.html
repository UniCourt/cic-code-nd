        The word “includes” in the definition of “dangerous weapon” is not a word of limitation but of enlargement and the term “dangerous weapon” includes weapons other than those specifically named in subsection 1 of this section. State v. Vermilya, 423 N.W.2d 153, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant’s convictions for being a felon in possession of firearms under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01 because there was testimony that the weapons seized from a search of defendant’s home were capable of firing and appeared to be in working order. Thus, they met the definition of a firearm under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-01-01(3).
   State v. Buchholz, 2006 ND 227, 723 N.W.2d 534, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 2006).

        A straight razor, unsuitable for shaving and altered in such a fashion as to enhance its effectiveness as a weapon, is a dangerous weapon that may not be carried concealed without a license or exemption.

        Subsection 1 of this section does not violate the right to keep and bear arms in N.D. Const., Art. I, § 1. State v. Ricehill, 415 N.W.2d 481, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 436</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s argument this section is unconstitutionally vague because it does not define what felonies and misdemeanors are violent and intimidating was immaterial to his position because he was charged with possessing a firearm within five years of having been released from probation for conviction of a felony under former subsection (2), and not conviction of a crime involving violence or intimidation. State v. Eldred, 1997 ND 112, 564 N.W.2d 283, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        As applied to appellant’s conduct, N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01(1)(c) was not vague as a reasonable person would have known that he was in constructive possession of firearms kept in his house, and appellant had been committed to a hospital by a court. Hill v. D.D. (In the Interest of D.D.), 2018 ND 201, 916 N.W.2d 765, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 203</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        The phrase “and that crime was committed while using or possessing a firearm or dangerous weapon” in former subsection (2) (see now (1)(b)) applies only to class A misdemeanors, and not felonies. State v. Eldred, 1997 ND 112, 564 N.W.2d 283, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defense of “mistake of law” does not apply to conviction under former subsection (2) (see now (1)(b)) because this section is a strict-liability statute, that does not have a culpability requirement. State v. Eldred, 1997 ND 112, 564 N.W.2d 283, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly prohibited from arguing a mistake of law defense under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-09 because his offense of possession of a firearm by a felon under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01(2) (see now (1)(b)) was a strict liability offense. Defendant’s prior sentence for issuing a check without sufficient funds was not illegal because the district court only addressed the conditions of probation under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-07 and did not address whether defendant could possess or own a firearm after probation. N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01 explicitly prohibited defendant from possessing firearms after he had been convicted of a felony reduced to a misdemeanor under N.D.C.C.§ 12.1-32-02(9) and defendant was presumed to know the law and could not claim that the prohibition did not apply to him.
   State v. Buchholz, 2006 ND 227, 723 N.W.2d 534, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>
        Where defendant was sentenced to 60 days, his felony conviction for issuing a check without sufficient funds was reduced to a misdemeanor conviction under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-02(9); accordingly, defendant was convicted of a felony and probable cause to believe defendant was a felon in possession of a firearm existed under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01(2) (see now (1)(b)), and the district court’s order discharging defendant from the charge of felon in possession of a firearm was reversed.

        It is reasonable to believe the legislature intended the prohibition in this section to be applicable to all felonies, not just those felonies committed with violence or intimidation, or those committed using or while in possession of a firearm or dangerous weapon. State v. Eldred, 1997 ND 112, 564 N.W.2d 283, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        The Constitution’s protection of the right to keep and bear arms is not absolute; although it prevents the negation of the right to keep and bear arms, that right nevertheless remains subject to reasonable regulation under the state’s police power. State v. Ricehill, 415 N.W.2d 481, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 436</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant’s convictions for being a felon in possession of firearms under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01 because there was testimony that the weapons seized from a search of defendant’s home were capable of firing and appeared to be in working order. Thus, they met the definition of a firearm under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-01-01(3).

       An individual prohibited from possessing a firearm due to a conviction of a felony under subdivision b of subsection 1 of section 62.1-02-01 may petition the district court for restoration of the individual’s firearm rights. If the felony offense was committed in this state, the petition must be filed with the district court in the county where the offense occurred. If the offense was a felony of another state or the federal government, the petition must be filed in the venue where the rights of the individual were revoked. A copy of the petition must be served on the state’s attorney’s office in the county where the petition is filed in accordance with Rule 5 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. The state’s attorney’s office has twenty days to file a written response to the petition with the district court.

        This section is not so vague that a person of ordinary intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning, nor so vague and standardless that it leaves the judges and jurors free to decide what is or is not prohibited by the statute in each particular case, and therefore, it satisfies the requirements of the due process.

       <p>
        The general definition of the term “explosives” as contained in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04(8) should be applied to ascertain the meaning of the term “explosives” in this section. State v. Johnson, 417 N.W.2d 365, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 448</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        Materials in defendant’s possession which consisted of an empty bottle of potassium nitrate, residue, aluminum metal powder, sulfur powder, black gunpowder, calcium sulfate, potassium perchlorate and calcium sulfate were included within the term “explosive” as used in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t62.1c62.1-02s62.1-02-11" target="_self">62.1-02-11</a></cite>.

        In defendant’s trial for possession of explosives in violation of this section, the trial court’s refusal to give defendant’s requested jury instructions was not error where the court did instruct the jury as to the essential elements of the offense and were adequate enough to properly apprise the jury as to the applicable law.

    Definition of concealed.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A firearm or dangerous weapon is concealed if it is carried in such a manner as to not be discernible by the ordinary observation of a passerby. There is no requirement that there be absolute invisibility of the firearm or dangerous weapon, merely that it not be ordinarily discernible. A firearm or dangerous weapon is considered concealed if it is not secured, and is worn under clothing or carried in a bundle that is held or carried by the individual, or transported in a vehicle under the individual’s control or direction and available to the individual, including beneath the seat or in a glove compartment. A firearm or dangerous weapon is not considered concealed if it is:

       When a chief law enforcement officer’s certification is required by federal law or regulation for the transfer or making of a firearm, the chief law enforcement officer, within thirty days of receipt of a request for certification, shall provide the certification if the applicant is not prohibited by law from receiving or possessing the firearm or is not the subject of a proceeding that could result in the applicant being prohibited by law from receiving or possessing the firearm. If the chief law enforcement officer is unable to make a certification as required by this section, the officer shall provide the applicant with a written notification of the denial and the reason for this determination.

      <li id="t62.1c62.1-05s62.1-05-03ol13">
       In making the certification required by subsection 2, a chief law enforcement officer or designee may require the applicant to provide only the information as is required by federal or state law to identify the applicant and conduct a criminal background check, including a check of the national instant criminal background check system, or to determine the disposition of an arrest or proceeding relevant to the applicant’s eligibility to lawfully possess or receive a firearm. A chief law enforcement officer may not require access to or consent for an inspection of any private premises as a condition of making a certification under this section.

       Chief law enforcement officers and their employees who act in good faith are immune from liability arising from any act or omission in making a certification as required by this section.

      <li id="t62.1c62.1-05s62.1-05-03ol15">
       An applicant whose request for certification is denied may appeal the chief law enforcement officer’s decision to the district court for the county in which the applicant resides in accordance with the procedures provided in section 28-34-01. If the court finds that the applicant is not prohibited by law from receiving or possessing the firearm, or is not the subject of a proceeding that could result in the prohibition, or that there is insufficient evidence to support the chief law enforcement officer’s determination that the officer cannot truthfully make the certification, the court shall order the chief law enforcement officer to issue the certification and award court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to the applicant.
