      <p>
       Project, which was completed for the purpose of repairing and maintaining a county’s roads, was not for the construction of a public improvement as defined by N.D.C.C. § 48-01.2-01, and therefore the statutory bond requirement for public improvements under N.D.C.C. § 48-01.2-10 did not apply. The district court did not err in granting summary judgment and dismissing plaintiff’s negligence claims against the county. Woodrock, Inc. v.

The bond must be for an amount equal at least to the price stated in the contract.

    Claim for public improvement — Suit on contractor’s bond.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person that has furnished labor or material for any public improvement for which a bond is furnished and has not been paid in full within ninety days after completion of the contribution of labor or materials may sue on the bond for the amount unpaid at the time of institution of suit. However, a person having a direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor, but no contractual relationship with the contractor furnishing the bond, does not have a claim for relief upon the bond unless that person has given written notice to the contractor, within ninety days from the date on which the person completed the contribution, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed and the name of the person for which the contribution was performed. The notice must be served by registered mail in an envelope addressed to the contractor at any place the contractor maintains an office, conducts business, or has a residence.
     </p>
     <p>
      A governing body shall provide a certified copy of the bond and the contract for which the bond was given to any individual who submits an affidavit that either the individual has supplied labor or materials for the improvement and that payment has not been made or that the individual is being sued on the bond. The individual requesting the copy shall pay the actual cost of the preparation of the certified copy of the bond and the contract. The certified copy of the bond is prima facie evidence of the contents, execution, and delivery of the original.

        The test used under the Miller Act, 40 USCS § 270b(a), after which this section is modeled, to determine when a subcontractor’s contribution is complete, thus triggering the commencement of the ninety-day notice period, is whether the last material or labor furnished is done as part of the original contract or merely to correct defects or to make repairs.

      At least once in each calendar month during the continuance of work upon any public improvement, the governing body shall receive and consider any partial payment estimate prepared by the architect or engineer. Upon review and approval, the governing body shall pay an estimate in an amount equal to the estimated value of the labor and material furnished plus the material adequately stored. A partial payment estimate must include retentions or retainage as follows: ten percent of each estimate until the project is fifty percent completed with no further retainage on estimates during the continuance of the contract unless unsatisfactory progress or performance is documented. The governing body may, upon completion of ninety-five percent of the contract, pay to the contractor up to ninety-five percent of the amount retained from previous estimates. The remaining amount retained must be paid to the contractor in the amounts and at the times approved by the architect or engineer. The governing body shall make final payment of all moneys due to the contractor following completion of all work, acceptance of the project by the governing body, and the provision of necessary releases. If an architect or engineer is not employed by the governing body for administration of the contract, the contractor, at the end of each calendar month during the continuance of work, may furnish a payment estimate to the governing body. After considering and approving an estimate, the governing body shall draw a warrant upon the proper fund and promptly transmit the warrant to the contractor. The governing body may invest or deposit any retained amount in a financial association or institution so that the contractor’s money retained is earning interest or dividends for the benefit of the contractor. Any amount invested or deposited must remain in the name of the governing body until final payment of all money due to the contractor is to be made.

      If a governing body fails or neglects to consider any estimate properly submitted, pay any estimate approved, or make final payment upon completion and acceptance of a public improvement, for a period of more than thirty days from the date of approval of the estimate or the completion and acceptance date, the governing body shall pay interest on the estimate or final payment from the date of approval. The interest rate must be the rate per annum of two percentage points below the Bank of North Dakota prime interest rate as set thirty days from the date of the estimate or completion date until the issuance of a proper warrant for the payment. The governing body shall compute and add the interest to the face of the estimate or final payment and the interest must be charged to the fund upon which payment for the contract is to be made. No payment for, or on account of, any contract made under this chapter may be made except upon estimate of the architect, engineer, or contractor as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t48c48-01.2s48-01.2-13" target="_self">48-01.2-13</a></cite>.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a state agency or institution may not significantly change or expand a public improvement beyond what has been approved by the legislative assembly unless the legislative assembly approves the change or expansion of the project or any additional expenditure for the project. During the time the legislative assembly is not in session, and unless otherwise restricted by previous legislative action or other law, the budget section may approve a change or expansion or any additional expenditure for the project. However, the budget section may not approve a change, expansion, or additional expenditure for the project during the six months preceding the convening of a regular session or during the three months following the close of a regular session except for changes in project scope and related additional expenditures resulting from an unforeseen emergency event. Any request considered by the budget section must comply with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.54.html#t54c54-35s54-35-02" target="_blank">54-35-02</a></cite>.9. For the purposes of this section, a significant change or expansion includes the construction of an addition to a building, including skywalks or other type of enclosed walkway, or any other substantial increase in the area of the building, but does not include the construction of building entrances and stairwells.

     <p>
      When it is deemed proper to set up charges for depreciation to ascertain a basis for insurance or for other purposes, the annual charge for depreciation shall be such an amount that it, with interest thereon added thereto annually at the highest rate of interest paid regularly on twelve-month deposits in the Bank of North Dakota, will aggregate at the end of the period estimated to be the natural life of the building or other structure, the original cost of the building or structure. Such addition annually of the depreciation charge and interest shall be credited to a fund to be entitled “reserve for depreciation”. The depreciation credit shall be charged against undivided profits and the interest credited to depreciation shall be charged to interest paid. Any depreciation charges made in excess of the amount herein provided shall be restored on the books and in the audits or reports of examination thereof to the fund against which such depreciation was previously charged in relation to the several institutions affected. Amounts credited, or investments in real estate and structures thereon, shall be restricted to the fund representing such assets, to the end that such real estate shall continue to be carried on the books at its original cost or actual value, whichever is lower as of the date of purchase or erection.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The governmental unit shall provide public notice of the meeting at which it proposes to award a guaranteed energy savings contract, the names of the parties to the proposed contract, and the purpose of the contract. After reviewing the report under section 48-05-10, a governmental unit may enter a guaranteed energy savings contract with a qualified provider if the governmental unit finds that the amount the governmental unit would spend on the energy conservation measures recommended in the report is not likely to exceed the amount to be saved in energy and operation costs over a period not exceeding fifteen years from the date of installation if the recommendations in the report are followed. The contract must include a written guarantee of the qualified provider that the energy and operating cost-savings will meet or exceed the costs of the project, including costs of the system, a list of subcontractor pricing, the financing costs for the project, and any provider fees. The written guarantee must be for a period equal to the financing period, which may provide payments over a period not exceeding fifteen years. If the governmental unit can document that savings meet or exceed the payment for a period of not less than three years, the governmental unit may request a waiver of the guaranteed portion of the contract for the remainder of the financing term. A guarantee waiver request must be approved by a committee administered by the division of community services. If the contract involves facility alteration or real property improvement, a qualified provider to whom the contract is awarded shall give a sufficient bond to the governmental unit for the faithful performance of the contract.
