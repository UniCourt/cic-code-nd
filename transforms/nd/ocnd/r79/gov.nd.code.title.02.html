     </h3>
     <p>
      After June 30, 1967, any airport authority, county, city, township, or other political subdivision which operates an airport, is hereby authorized to carry liability insurance for its own protection and the protection of any employee from claim for loss or damage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of or by reason of its operation and maintenance of airport facilities in connection therewith or landing fields; provided, that any airport authority or political subdivision, and its agents, servants, and employees have full government immunity for any claims in excess of the limits afforded by such insurance policies or full governmental immunity in the event no insurance is carried. The existence of insurance coverage may not be conveyed to the jury in the event of suits thereon, either directly or indirectly. If a dispute exists concerning the amount or nature of the insurance coverage, the dispute must be tried separately before the main trial determining the claims and damages of the claimant. This statute confers no right for a claimant to sue the insurer directly.

     <p>
      Flight in aircraft over the lands and waters of this state is lawful, unless at such a low altitude as to interfere with the then existing use to which the land or water, or the space over the land or water is put by the owner, or unless so conducted as to be imminently dangerous to persons or property lawfully on the land or water beneath. The landing of an aircraft on the lands or waters of another, without the owner’s consent, is unlawful except in the case of a forced landing. For damages caused by a forced landing, however, the owner or lessee of the aircraft or the airman is liable, as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t02c2-03s2-03-05" target="_self">2-03-05</a></cite>.

    Damage to persons and property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The owner and the pilot, or either of them, of every aircraft which is operated over the lands or waters of this state are liable for injuries to persons or property on the land or water beneath caused by the ascent, descent, or flight of the aircraft, or the dropping or falling of any object therefrom, in accordance with the rules of law applicable to torts in this state, unless the injury is caused in whole or in part by the negligence of the person injured, or of the owner or bailee of the property injured. If the aircraft is leased at the time of the injury to person or property, both owner and lessee are liable and they may be sued jointly, or either or both of them may be sued separately. An airman who is not the owner or lessee is liable only for the consequences of that person’s own negligence. The injured person, or owner, or bailee of the injured property, has a lien on the aircraft causing the injury to the extent of the damage caused by the aircraft or objects falling from it.
     </p>
     <p>
      As used in this section, “owner” includes a person having full title to aircraft and operating it through servants, and also includes a bona fide lessee or bailee of such aircraft, whether gratuitously or for hire; but “owner”, as used in this section, does not include a bona fide bailor or lessor of such aircraft, whether gratuitously or for hire, or a mortgagee, conditional seller, trustee for creditors of such aircraft or other person having a security title only, nor is the owner of such aircraft liable when the pilot thereof is in possession thereof as a result of theft or felonious conversion.
     </p>
     <p>
      The person in whose name an aircraft is registered with the United States department of transportation or the aeronautics commission of this state is prima facie the owner of such aircraft within the meaning of this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      No person transported by the owner or operator of any aircraft as a guest without payment for such transportation has claim for relief for damages against the owner or operator for injury, death, or loss in case of accident, unless the accident was caused by the gross negligence, intoxication, or willful and wanton misconduct of the owner or operator of the aircraft, and unless the gross negligence, intoxication, or willful and wanton misconduct of the owner or operator of the aircraft contributed to the injury, death, or loss. No person so transported has claim for relief if that person has willfully or by want of ordinary care brought about that person’s own injury. For purposes of this section, the word “guest” means any person other than an employee of the owner or registrant of any aircraft, or of a person responsible for its operation with the owner’s or registrant’s express or implied consent, being in or upon, entering or leaving the same, except any passenger for hire and except any passenger while the aircraft is being used in the business of demonstrating or testing. The sharing of expense does not constitute a carriage for hire within the meaning of this section.

      It is hereby found that an airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking off, and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the public investment therein.

       Prior to the initial zoning of any airport hazard area under this chapter, the political subdivision or joint airport zoning board which is to adopt the regulations shall appoint a commission, to be known as the airport zoning commission, to recommend the boundaries of the various zones to be established and the regulations to be adopted therefor. The commission shall make a preliminary report and hold public hearings thereon before submitting its final report, and the legislative body of the political subdivision or the joint airport zoning board shall not hold its public hearings or take other action until it has received the final report of such commission. If a city planning commission or zoning commission already exists, it may be appointed as the airport zoning commission.

       Reasonableness. All airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter must be reasonable and none may impose any requirement or restriction which is not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. In determining what regulations it may adopt, each political subdivision and joint airport zoning board shall consider, among other things, the character of the flying operations expected to be conducted at the airport, the nature of the terrain within the airport hazard area, the character of the neighborhood, and the uses to which the property to be zoned is put and adaptable.

       Permits. Any airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter may require that a permit be obtained before any new structure or use may be constructed or established and before any existing use or structure may be substantially changed or substantially altered or repaired. In any event, however, all such regulations must provide that before any nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the administrative agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations, authorizing such replacement, change, or repair. No permit may be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming structure or tree or nonconforming use to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when applicable regulation was adopted or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as provided herein, all applications for permits must be granted.
      </li>
      <li id="t02c2-04s2-04-07ol12">
       Variances. Any person desiring to erect any structure, or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or otherwise use that person’s property in violation of airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from the zoning regulations in question. Such variances must be allowed where a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of the regulations and this chapter; provided, that any variance may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the board of adjustment may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

       Hazard marking and lighting. In granting any permit or variance under this section, the administrative agency or board of adjustment may, if it deems such action advisable to effectuate the purposes of this chapter and reasonable in the circumstances, so condition such permit or variance as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to permit the political subdivision, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.

      All airport zoning regulations adopted under this chapter must provide for the administration and enforcement of such regulations by an administrative agency which may be an agency created by such regulations or any official, board, or other existing agency of the political subdivision adopting the regulations or of one of the political subdivisions which participated in the creation of the joint airport zoning board adopting the regulations, if satisfactory to that political subdivision, but in no case may such administrative agency be or include any member of the board of adjustment. The duties of any administrative agency designated pursuant to this chapter include that of hearing and deciding all permits under subsection 1 of section 2-04-07, but such agency shall not have or exercise any of the powers herein delegated to the board of adjustment.

       Upon presentation of such petition the court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to the board of adjustment to review such a decision of the board.

       The board of adjustment is not required to return the original papers acted upon by it, but it is sufficient to return certified or sworn copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called for by the writ.

       The court has exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or set aside the decision brought up for review, in whole or in part, and if need be, to order further proceedings by the board of adjustment. The findings of fact of the board, if supported by substantial evidence, must be accepted by the court as conclusive, and no objection to a decision of the board may be considered by the court unless such objection has been urged before the board, or, if it was not so urged, unless there were reasonable grounds for failure to do so.

      An airport authority may request annually from the governing bodies of the municipalities within the authority, an amount of tax to be levied by each municipality, and the municipalities may levy the amount requested, under the law authorizing cities and other political subdivisions of this state to levy taxes for airport purposes. With its levy request under this section, an airport authority may certify its current and anticipated revenues and resources, any anticipated revenue shortfall for bonded debt payment, and the amount necessary from its property tax levy authority for its annual principal and interest payment for bonded debt incurred under this chapter. If the authority finds the certified amount is necessary for the annual bonded debt payment, the municipality shall levy for the airport authority not less than the certified amount. In the year for which the levy is sought, an airport authority that is not a city or county governing body and which is seeking approval of a property tax levy of a city or county governing body under this chapter shall file with the auditor of each participating city or county, at a time and in a format prescribed by the auditors, a financial report for the preceding calendar year showing the ending balances of each fund held by the airport authority during that year. The levy made may not exceed the maximum levy permitted by the laws of this state for airport purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The municipality shall collect the taxes levied for an airport authority in the same manner as other taxes are levied and collected. The proceeds of the taxes must be deposited in a special account in which other revenues of the authority are deposited, and may be expended by the authority as allowed under this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before the issuance of bonds under section 2-06-10, the airport authority or the municipality may by resolution provide its commitment under section 2-06-10 that the total amount of taxes then authorized by law, or such portion as may be specified by the resolution, will be certified, levied, and deposited annually until the bonds and interest are fully paid.

    Aircraft dealer’s license — Fees — Dealer’s place of business.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No person, partnership, association, corporation, or limited liability company may engage in the business of buying, selling, leasing, or exchanging aircraft, or advertise or hold out to the public as being in the business of buying, selling, leasing, or exchanging of aircraft without first being licensed as provided in this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aeronautics commission shall prescribe and furnish license and renewal license application forms. A nonrefundable fee of one hundred fifty dollars must accompany each application for each dealer location. A dealer’s license expires on December thirty-first of each year, and application for renewal must be made before the expiration of the current dealer’s license. For each annual one hundred fifty dollar license fee or renewal, the dealer must be issued one dealer’s registration for one demonstrator aircraft. Additional dealer’s demonstrator aircraft registrations must be issued to a licensed dealer upon the payment of ten dollars for each additional demonstrator aircraft, provided such demonstrator aircraft are not used for commercial purposes to produce rental or air taxi revenue, or used for aerial spraying while awaiting sale or trade. All new or used demonstrator aircraft which are for resale but are used by a dealer to produce commercial revenue, or air taxi or rental revenue or for aerial spraying must be registered with the commission and the annual registration fees paid in accordance with the laws of this state. Fees from license applications of aircraft dealers must be deposited with the state treasurer and credited to the aeronautics commission special fund. Fees received for additional aircraft registrations for demonstrator aircraft must be deposited with the state treasurer, who shall deposit such funds in the aeronautics commission special fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      An applicant for a license or renewal of a license shall submit to the aeronautics commission an inventory of aircraft held by the applicant along with a separate demonstration flight log of time accumulated for those demonstration flights and aircraft tachometer readings for each aircraft on the date of initial application and on November thirtieth before the yearly renewal time. Information on inventory must be provided to the commission on an approved report form. If an aircraft is held in inventory for more than twelve months and is flown more than fifty hours of flight time in any given twelve-month period of time, the commission shall determine if the aircraft is a demonstration aircraft. When the hours flown exceed fifty hours in the twelve-month period, the aircraft is presumed not to be a demonstration aircraft and the aircraft excise tax must be remitted to the aeronautics commission under chapter 57-40.5 unless upon satisfactory proof the aeronautics commission determines the aircraft is used exclusively for demonstration purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aeronautics commission shall issue dealer’s licenses only to dealers who maintain a permanent place of business on an airport open for public use, whether publicly or privately owned in the state of North Dakota, with runway length, aprons, and safe aircraft approaches adequate for fixed wing aircraft or helicopters of the type sold by such a dealer. An established central place on an airport means that such dealer has an enclosed office, building, or structure owned or leased with adequate facilities and equipment for the maintenance, service, and repair of aircraft. The dealer shall maintain business records in the dealer’s place of business. The dealer’s place of business must be adequate to conduct an aircraft dealer’s business where selling, trading, and bartering of aircraft may be conducted and may not be a residence or temporary quarters or so-called permanent quarters occupied pursuant to temporary arrangements. An applicant for an aircraft dealer’s license cannot qualify with only a privately owned aircraft hangar as a place of business, which is usually used for storage of aircraft on an airport open for public use. An aircraft dealer to qualify for a dealer’s license must maintain an aircraft or helicopter service and repair shop on an airport open for public use with a minimum of five thousand dollars in tools, equipment, aircraft parts, and supplies, as determined by a representative of the director of the aeronautics commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aeronautics commission shall issue a license only after inspection and approval of the aircraft dealer’s facilities.

     </p>
     <p>
      An ultralight vehicle dealer shall maintain a permanent place of business in North Dakota which may be off or on an airport; provided, if the place of the business is off an airport, such dealer shall maintain a cleared area of sufficient size and length to safely demonstrate ultralight vehicles without undue approach hazards or hazards to other persons or property. The dealer shall maintain business records in the dealer’s place of business. An ultralight dealer to qualify for a dealer’s license shall maintain at least one flyable ultralight vehicle for demonstration purposes and shall maintain a minimum of five hundred dollars in tools, equipment, parts, or supplies to provide service for ultralight vehicles. The aeronautics commission has the option of inspection of each ultralight dealer prior to issuing a dealer’s license or a renewal.
