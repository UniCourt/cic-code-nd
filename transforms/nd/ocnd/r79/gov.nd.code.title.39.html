        Reading N.D.C.C. §§ 39-01-01(73) and 39-10-38(1) and the definition of highway at § 39-01-01(29) together, no person may turn a vehicle or move right or left upon that portion of a publicly maintained way improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel without giving an appropriate signal; section 39-10-38(1) requires drivers to signal prior to exiting alleys when such alleys qualify as roadways under § 39-01-01(73). State v. Hirschkorn, 2016 ND 117, 881 N.W.2d 244, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        Under a concerted, harmonious interpretation, N.D.C.C. § 39-10-45 supplements rather than supplants N.D.C.C. § 39-10-38(1); Read together, §§ 39-10-38(1) and 39-10-45 require drivers to stop at specific distances before exiting alleys in addition to, but not exclusive of, requiring drivers on roadways to signal when appropriate.

        There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol because a district court was not obligated to believe testimony that a dirt bike was inoperable or that drinking occurred while the bike was being pushed. It was not necessary to decide if defendant was a “driver” based on his ability to direct the movement of the bike by steering and controlling the brakes because there was other evidence of defendant's driving prior to being located by an officer; the officer responded to a complaint about dirt bikes being driven in a recreational area, the officer heard the dirt bikes near the bottom of a dam area, and he saw headlights in the trees.

        Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of an insurer in a declaratory judgment action to determine the applicability of an exception to a motor vehicle exclusion in a farmer’s policy for vehicles primarily used as farm implements.

       Suspension of a driver’s license in 1990 was a conviction under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8) and N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) because a transportation department was an authorized administrative tribunal under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8), and the definition of conviction under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) was used instead of the definition of conviction in
   N.D.C.C. § 39-06-30 since N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) was the more specific statute; therefore, a lifetime suspension of a commercial license was proper for two driving under the influence convictions. Bienek v. DOT, 2007 ND 117, 736 N.W.2d 492, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2007). (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-30).
      </p>
      <p>
       Definition of “conviction” in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) is a special provision applicable to commercial driver’s licenses that conflicts with the definition of “conviction” in N.D.C.C. § 39-06-30, a general provision applicable to motor vehicle operator’s licenses; under statutory construction principles, the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) prevails over the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-06s39-06-30" target="_self">39-06-30</a></cite>. Therefore, the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) must be used when interpreting N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8). (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-30) Bienek v. DOT, 2007 ND 117, 736 N.W.2d 492, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       While defendant’s appeal of DUI and DUS convictions was pending, defendant was convicted, again, of DUI and DUS; trial court could properly use DUI and DUS that were pending on appeal for enhancement purposes because the first DUI and DUS were “convictions,” as defined by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-06s39-06-30" target="_self">39-06-30</a></cite>.

      </p>

       Where defendant did not show up for trial on a driving under the influence (DUI) charge and the municipal court granted the city prosecutor’s motion to forfeit his bond, defendant prevented the occurrence of the jurisdictional predicate (a municipal court trial and a determination by the municipal judge) giving rise to his right to secure a jury trial upon appeal (decided prior to 1987 amendments to N.D.C.C. § 40-18-15 and enactment of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-18s40-18-15" target="_blank">40-18-15</a></cite>.1). (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-30) City of Minot v. Mattern, 449 N.W.2d 560, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       Meaning of “Conviction” in Section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-06s39-06-27" target="_self">39-06-27</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proper interpretation of “conviction” for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 39-06-27 is a final order or judgment of conviction by the supreme court of a sister state or any lower court of that state having jurisdiction, provided that no appeal is pending and the time for filing a notice of appeal has elapsed. That construction preserves the legislative intent regarding license suspensions or revocations resulting from convictions in sister states and gives meaning to both N.D.C.C. § 39-06-27 and this section. Holen v. Hjelle, 396 N.W.2d 290, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 437</cite> (N.D. 1986) (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-30).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the literal definition of conviction in this section is applied to N.D.C.C. § 39-06-27, that section and other provisions relating to license suspensions or revocations for out-of-state convictions would be rendered meaningless, creating an absurd and ludicrous result. Holen v. Hjelle, 396 N.W.2d 290, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 437</cite> (N.D. 1986) (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-30).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly considered a criminal conviction which was pending appeal during the sentencing hearing, and defendant’s reliance on N.D.C.C. § 39-06-30 which deals with the timing of reports of convictions to the appropriate licensing authority for purposes of license suspensions and revocations was misplaced as it did not define a conviction for purposes of sentencing a defendant under Title 12.1 of the N.D.C.C. State v. Ellis, 2001 ND 84, 625 N.W.2d 544, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 2001) (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-30).

       An unsigned document asserted to be a notice of conviction in another state, which did not bear any indication of a judgment having been rendered, a suspension, or a certification, did not constitute notice of a conviction for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 39-06-27 and this section providing for suspension of driving privileges. Langer v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 409 N.W.2d 635, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 367</cite> (N.D. 1987) (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-30).

        Purpose of Amendments.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative history reflects that amendments to this section were made to require reports of convictions to be made to the licensing authority after a decision by the North Dakota supreme court or the running of the time for appeal rather than after a “final” order or judgment of conviction by a trial court. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that, by defining conviction as it did, the legislative assembly intended to eliminate the use of convictions in sister states for North Dakota license suspensions or revocations. Rather, the purpose of the amendments was to deal with the timing of reports of convictions by North Dakota courts to the licensing authority. Holen v. Hjelle, 396 N.W.2d 290, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 437</cite> (N.D. 1986) (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-30).

        Suspension and Revocation Distinguished.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A suspension is effective for a specified period while a revocation continues until such time as a new application has been submitted and new license issued; where a defendant took no action regarding reinstatement of his driving privilege following the revocation of his license, he was properly prosecuted under N.D.C.C. § 39-06-42, establishing the criminal penalty for driving while under suspension or revocation. State v. Brude, 222 N.W.2d 296, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The distinction between suspension and revocation under these sections is that a suspension is effective for a specified period, while a revocation continues until such time as a new application has been submitted and a license issued. City of Wahpeton v. Desjarlais, 458 N.W.2d 330, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1990) (decided under former N.D.C.C. 39-06-23).

       39-01-01.1.
    Declaration of legislative intent.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly in adopting title 39 recognized that the development of a modern and integrated highway system which is so essential to safe and efficient highway transportation represents a large investment of public funds. To ensure maximum public benefits from such investment, authority has been vested in appropriate agencies of government for the establishment, construction, maintenance, and operation of needed road facilities, within the limits of funds made available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Additionally, the legislative assembly recognizes that other functions of government, established pursuant to title 39 to govern the ownership and use of motor vehicles, also are supported by public funds and render important public services which contribute to the safe and efficient use of roads and streets. The responsibilities of state government include such functions as vehicle registration and titling, driver licensing, financial responsibility, police traffic supervision, accident investigation and reporting, and use of accident records, traffic operations, and similar functions conducted under motor vehicle laws affecting motor vehicles and their use.
     </p>
     <p>
      In fulfilling these responsibilities, the legislative assembly recognizes the necessity that individual prerogatives be considered secondary to the general welfare and so it is expected that the officials will adopt such reasonable policies, procedures, rules, and regulations as may be necessary, within the authority granted by law, and in so doing shall make appropriate use of recommended standards developed by recognized official groups to ensure a desirable level of uniformity throughout the state and with other states. Such uniformity is especially important in the use and application of uniform signs, signals, and markings.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is expected, further, that the officials will cooperate with each other where such cooperation is essential, and not otherwise prescribed by law. Moreover, there is also need for more effective coordination of activities among all branches and levels of government in carrying out their respective traffic safety responsibilities, including the governor’s office, the state legislative assembly and city councils, the administrative, enforcement, and judicial officials of the state and its political subdivisions. In all matters of mutual concern, and where appropriate, cooperation is also encouraged among state officials, officials of other states and the federal government, and other responsible groups, both public and private.
     </p>
     <p>
      Highway transportation is a dynamic force in our society and is influenced by new developments and changing public needs. To keep abreast of foreseeable adjustments, it is expected that the officials will engage in such research and planning as may be necessary and as may be provided for in this title. Such efforts should be conducted in cooperation with all interested public and private groups, and directed towards the development of realistic traffic accident prevention programs to guide legislative decisions and enlist public support in meeting immediate and potential needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      In keeping with the policies herein enunciated, it is the intent of the legislative assembly to equip each function with the necessary authority to maintain an adequate level of performance in all functions concerned with the ownership and use of motor vehicles, as they are established in title 39, consistent with the expanding needs of highway transportation, in order to protect the public safety, promote the general welfare, and advance the economy of the state.

        Erroneous Driver’s License Suspension.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Driver had no cause of action arising from an erroneous license suspension; clerks of court had no authority under N.D.C.C. tit. 39 to suspend licenses, quasi-judicial immunity protected the Director of the North Dakota Department of Transportation pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 32-12.2-02(3)(d), and no private right of action existed against the State under N.D. Const. art. I., § 9 for acts not described in N.D.C.C. § 32-12.2-02(1). Kouba v. State, 2004 ND 186, 687 N.W.2d 466, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 321</cite> (N.D. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Driver’s license was not suspended according to law because, when the driver did not timely request an administrative hearing, it was error for a hearing officer to conclude the Department of Transportation had no jurisdiction, as the issue was whether that jurisdiction was properly invoked, which it was not, so the license could only be administratively revoked, and it was error to conduct a hearing.

       <p>
        Where plaintiff, a North Dakota resident, was injured while unloading a truck belonging to a foreign corporation and the injuries were not the proximate result of any defective condition of the truck, and where such truck had arrived at its destination and was parked at the curb at the time of the injury, the injury did not grow “out of the use or operation” of the truck within the meaning of this section and therefore service of process upon the highway commissioner was not sufficient service upon the defendant.

The director shall waive the requirement for a written or electronic statement from a qualified physician, physician assistant, chiropractor, or an advanced practice registered nurse if the applicant has previously submitted an application containing a certification from a qualified physician, physician assistant, chiropractor, or an advanced practice registered nurse that the applicant’s impairment is not reversible. The application must include the information required by the director. The physician’s, physician assistant’s, chiropractor’s, or advanced practice registered nurse’s statement must describe how the impairment limits the applicant’s mobility and daily life functions of the applicant. The certificate is valid for a period, not to exceed three years, as determined by the director. A physician, physician assistant, chiropractor, or an advanced practice registered nurse who provides a false statement that an individual is mobility impaired for the purpose of that individual obtaining a certificate under this subsection is guilty of an infraction for which a minimum fine of one hundred dollars must be imposed. A certificate issued under this subsection must be nine and one-half inches [24.13 centimeters] in height and three inches [7.62 centimeters] in width and must bear, in white on blue, the internationally accepted symbol of access for the mobility impaired. The certificate must bear the expiration date and registration number assigned by the director. The director shall adopt rules governing the issuance of the certificate. A temporary certificate, valid for an initial period not to exceed three months, may be issued by the director for a fee of three dollars upon application supported by a physician’s, physician assistant’s, chiropractor’s, or an advanced practice registered nurse’s statement. The director may issue a maximum of one additional temporary certificate for a fee of three dollars. The temporary certificate may be extended an additional period, not to exceed three months, upon application supported by a physician’s, physician assistant’s, chiropractor’s, or an advanced practice registered nurse’s statement that the extension is warranted. Temporary certificates must be the same size as other certificates issued under this section and must be white on red. The director may issue a maximum of one additional certificate, if the applicant does not have number plates issued under section 39-04-10.2 or under subdivision j of subsection 2 of section 39-04-18, to a mobility-impaired individual to whom a certificate has been issued under this subsection.

However, any municipality may prohibit, by ordinance, parking on any highway for the purpose of creating a fire lane or to provide for the accommodation of heavy traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours.

       The director may issue a special identifying certificate to any mobility-impaired applicant upon submission by the applicant of a completed application and a written or electronic statement issued by a qualified physician, physician assistant, chiropractor, or an advanced practice registered nurse to the director that the applicant is a mobility-impaired person within the criteria of subsection 2. The director shall waive the requirement for a written or electronic statement from a qualified physician, physician assistant, chiropractor, or an advanced practice registered nurse if the applicant has previously submitted an application containing a certification from a qualified physician, physician assistant, chiropractor, or an advanced practice registered nurse that the applicant’s impairment is not reversible. The application must include the information required by the director. The physician’s, physician assistant’s, chiropractor’s, or advanced practice registered nurse’s statement must describe how the impairment limits the applicant’s mobility and daily life functions of the applicant. The certificate is valid for a period, not to exceed three years, as determined by the director. A physician, physician assistant, chiropractor, or an advanced practice registered nurse who provides a false statement that an individual is mobility impaired for the purpose of that individual obtaining a certificate under this subsection is guilty of an infraction for which a minimum fine of one hundred dollars must be imposed. A certificate issued under this subsection must be nine and one-half inches [24.13 centimeters] in height and three inches [7.62 centimeters] in width and must bear, in white on blue, the internationally accepted symbol of access for the mobility impaired. The certificate must bear the expiration date and registration number assigned by the director. The director shall adopt rules governing the issuance of the certificate. A temporary certificate, valid for an initial period not to exceed three months, may be issued by the director for a fee of three dollars upon application supported by a physician’s, physician assistant’s, chiropractor’s, or an advanced practice registered nurse’s statement. The director may issue a maximum of one additional temporary certificate for a fee of three dollars. The temporary certificate may be extended an additional period, not to exceed three months, upon application supported by a physician’s, physician assistant’s, chiropractor’s, or an advanced practice registered nurse’s statement that the extension is warranted. Temporary certificates must be the same size as other certificates issued under this section and must be white on red. The director may issue a maximum of one additional certificate, if the applicant does not have number plates issued under section 39-04-10.2 or under subdivision j of subsection 2 of section 39-04-18, to a mobility-impaired individual to whom a certificate has been issued under this subsection. The additional certificates may only be used by or on behalf of the mobility-impaired individual.

       Except as provided in this subsection, two dollars of each fee for issuance of a certificate and one dollar of each fee for issuance of an additional certificate under this section must be deposited in the state highway department fund for purposes of defraying the cost of issuing the certificate. The rest of the fee, and the five dollar fee received for the issuance of an additional certificate under subsection 4, must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to the state rehabilitation council fund. The fees deposited in the fund are hereby appropriated on a continuing basis to the department of health and human services for use by the state rehabilitation council to accomplish the council’s statutory duties provided under section 50-06.1-16. If a certificate is lost, mutilated, or destroyed, the individual to whom the certificate was issued is entitled to a replacement. The individual shall furnish proof satisfactory to the director that the certificate has been lost, mutilated, or destroyed, and shall pay a replacement fee of three dollars.

       An applicant may appeal a decision denying issuance of the certificate to the director. Written notice of the appeal must be received within ten business days following receipt by the applicant of notice of denial. The applicant has sixty days to provide additional supportive material to the director for purposes of deciding the appeal. The director shall affirm or reverse the decision to deny issuance of the certificate within thirty days after receipt of the supportive material. Written notice of the decision must be given to the applicant.

    Hearing on alleged violations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person having information that a licensed dealer has violated any provisions of this title may file with the director an affidavit specifically setting forth such violation. Upon receipt of such affidavit, the director shall investigate the violation alleged in the affidavit. If, after investigation, the director determines that the dealer’s license will be revoked or suspended, a notice of intent to revoke or suspend the license must be mailed to the dealer by certified mail. The notice must provide the dealer with an opportunity for a hearing prior to the effective date of the license revocation or suspension. A record of such hearings must be made by stenographic notes or use of an electronic recording device.
     </p>
     <p>
      If after such hearing the director finds the violation charged in the affidavit has been proved by the evidence, an order must be served on the licensee revoking or suspending the dealer’s license for a period of time to be determined by the director. Such action may be appealed to the district court by following the appeal procedure set forth in chapter 28-32, except that the order revoking or suspending the license is ineffective while the appeal is pending.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director has the power to appoint an administrative hearing officer to conduct the hearing, administer oaths, and subpoena and examine witnesses. The administrative hearing officer shall submit the findings to the director for consideration and final decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any witness called by the prosecution, except a peace officer while on duty, shall receive the same fees and mileage as a witness in a civil case in district court.

    Permits for vending machines at rest areas. [Effective through August 31, 2022]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A vending machine that allows access to a tobacco product may not be placed or remain upon a rest area, and any other vending machine may not be placed or remain upon a rest area under the supervision of the director without a permit from the director. The director shall charge a fee for the issuance of a vending machine permit. The amount of the permit fee must relate to the department’s actual cost of administration, annual review, and enforcement of the permit process, but may not exceed twenty-five dollars annually. The permit process may not be affected by the content of a publication. The director shall require permittees to comply with appropriate indemnification, insurance, and other risk management provisions of the permit. Vending machines must be secured in a manner that prevents tipping and moving, deters theft, and leaves state property undamaged. Plexiglass, safety glass, or other shatter-resistant materials must be employed in windows or displays. All vending machines must be sufficiently enclosed to prevent the distributed product from inadvertently being removed or blown from the machine or weathered by the elements. Stolen or damaged vending machines do not result in liability to the department and must be repaired, restored, or replaced within thirty calendar days. All cashboxes and accesses to cashboxes must be metal and securely locked in place. All vending machines must be placed in a well-lighted area visible from the rest area roadway. All vending machines must be placed on a route allowing parallel access by motorized or standard wheelchairs, with at least sixty-six inches [1676.400 millimeters] of clear width. A vending machine may not have a component or function used by the public which requires more than five pounds [2.268 kilograms] of force to be applied. The height of controls, doors, or access points necessary for use by the public may not exceed sixty inches [1524 millimeters]. The director may determine the maximum number of vending machine placements at a given rest area. Priority must be given to vending machines placed pursuant to the Randolph Sheppard Act [Pub. L. 74-732; 49 Stat. 1559; 20 U.S.C. 107], as administered by the vocational rehabilitation division of the department of human services under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.50.html#t50c50-06.1s50-06.1-13" target="_blank">50-06.1-13</a></cite>. When, after allowing for the placement of vending machines pursuant to the Randolph Sheppard Act [Pub. L. 74-732; 49 Stat. 1559; 20 U.S.C. 107], the director determines that the number of permit applications for a particular rest area would exceed the remaining available space or would prevent compliance with this section or other law, the director shall grant permits by means of a lottery, with permits allocated pro rata according to the number of applications for each type. The permittee is solely responsible to ensure that any trash, wrapping, boxes, or debris, generated when stocking or servicing vending machines is not left on or at the rest area. The permittee is solely responsible for all installation, maintenance, replacement, inspection, access area cleaning, and stocking of vending machines. Vandalism and graffiti on vending machines must be repaired or removed within fourteen days of written notice by the director. The permittee must inspect and stock vending machines as needed, but at least monthly, to provide adequate service to the public. Vending machines removed for repair or for other reasons must be restored or replaced by the permittee within thirty days. Vending machines in violation of this section or any other applicable law may be removed by the director fourteen days after notice of violation is provided and without liability to the director. Vending machines judged by the director to pose a risk to safety may be removed immediately without liability to the director and without prior notice to the permittee. The director shall retain any removed vending machines for thirty days to allow retrieval by the permittee, after compensation to the director for removal costs. The director may dispose of or sell machines not retrieved within thirty days of removal, but removal costs must be satisfied only to the extent of proceeds received by the director. The director has a cause of action to recover any deficiency, attorney’s fees, and litigation expenses. The director, upon the determination that a rest area must be closed for a period of greater than thirty days, may order the permittee, at the permittee’s expense, to remove all vending machines in a manner that does not damage state property, or remove all product and money and place upon the vending machine a prominent notice that all product and money have been removed. Should the director determine that removal of vending machines is necessary to conduct repairs, construction, surveys, or other duties of the department, the permittee, at the permittee’s expense, shall remove all vending machines in a manner that does not damage state property, upon fourteen days’ notice. The current address and telephone number where customer service or business is conducted by the permittee must be legibly and prominently posted upon the vending machine. The director shall cancel the permit should the permittee remove vending machines, except as provided in this section. The cost of any removal must be borne by the permittee. The permittee, at the permittee’s own expense, must restore the site the machine formerly occupied to the satisfaction of the director. For purposes of this section, “vending machine” means any device that allows access to a newspaper, magazine, beverage, concession, or other item for public consumption or use. For purposes of this section, “permittee” means any person or organization, including any corporation, partnership, firm, or any other legal entity capable of owning property and transacting business, which has applied for a permit under this chapter. For purposes of this section, “notice” consists of a written communication and must be deemed to have occurred within seventy-two hours of mailing, if mailed within North Dakota, or one hundred twenty hours of mailing, if mailed outside North Dakota. “Notice” to a vendor of the condition of a vending machine also occurs if a period of time greater than the required inspection interval for the vending machines has passed.

    Permits for vending machines at rest areas. [Effective September 1, 2022]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A vending machine that allows access to a tobacco product may not be placed or remain upon a rest area, and any other vending machine may not be placed or remain upon a rest area under the supervision of the director without a permit from the director. The director shall charge a fee for the issuance of a vending machine permit. The amount of the permit fee must relate to the department’s actual cost of administration, annual review, and enforcement of the permit process, but may not exceed twenty-five dollars annually. The permit process may not be affected by the content of a publication. The director shall require permittees to comply with appropriate indemnification, insurance, and other risk management provisions of the permit. Vending machines must be secured in a manner that prevents tipping and moving, deters theft, and leaves state property undamaged. Plexiglass, safety glass, or other shatter-resistant materials must be employed in windows or displays. All vending machines must be sufficiently enclosed to prevent the distributed product from inadvertently being removed or blown from the machine or weathered by the elements. Stolen or damaged vending machines do not result in liability to the department and must be repaired, restored, or replaced within thirty calendar days. All cashboxes and accesses to cashboxes must be metal and securely locked in place. All vending machines must be placed in a well-lighted area visible from the rest area roadway. All vending machines must be placed on a route allowing parallel access by motorized or standard wheelchairs, with at least sixty-six inches [1676.400 millimeters] of clear width. A vending machine may not have a component or function used by the public which requires more than five pounds [2.268 kilograms] of force to be applied. The height of controls, doors, or access points necessary for use by the public may not exceed sixty inches [1524 millimeters]. The director may determine the maximum number of vending machine placements at a given rest area. Priority must be given to vending machines placed pursuant to the Randolph Sheppard Act [Pub. L. 74-732; 49 Stat. 1559; 20 U.S.C. 107], as administered by the vocational rehabilitation division of the department of health and human services under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.50.html#t50c50-06.1s50-06.1-13" target="_blank">50-06.1-13</a></cite>. When, after allowing for the placement of vending machines pursuant to the Randolph Sheppard Act [Pub. L. 74-732; 49 Stat. 1559; 20 U.S.C. 107], the director determines that the number of permit applications for a particular rest area would exceed the remaining available space or would prevent compliance with this section or other law, the director shall grant permits by means of a lottery, with permits allocated pro rata according to the number of applications for each type. The permittee is solely responsible to ensure that any trash, wrapping, boxes, or debris, generated when stocking or servicing vending machines is not left on or at the rest area. The permittee is solely responsible for all installation, maintenance, replacement, inspection, access area cleaning, and stocking of vending machines. Vandalism and graffiti on vending machines must be repaired or removed within fourteen days of written notice by the director. The permittee must inspect and stock vending machines as needed, but at least monthly, to provide adequate service to the public. Vending machines removed for repair or for other reasons must be restored or replaced by the permittee within thirty days. Vending machines in violation of this section or any other applicable law may be removed by the director fourteen days after notice of violation is provided and without liability to the director. Vending machines judged by the director to pose a risk to safety may be removed immediately without liability to the director and without prior notice to the permittee. The director shall retain any removed vending machines for thirty days to allow retrieval by the permittee, after compensation to the director for removal costs. The director may dispose of or sell machines not retrieved within thirty days of removal, but removal costs must be satisfied only to the extent of proceeds received by the director. The director has a cause of action to recover any deficiency, attorney’s fees, and litigation expenses. The director, upon the determination that a rest area must be closed for a period of greater than thirty days, may order the permittee, at the permittee’s expense, to remove all vending machines in a manner that does not damage state property, or remove all product and money and place upon the vending machine a prominent notice that all product and money have been removed. Should the director determine that removal of vending machines is necessary to conduct repairs, construction, surveys, or other duties of the department, the permittee, at the permittee’s expense, shall remove all vending machines in a manner that does not damage state property, upon fourteen days’ notice. The current address and telephone number where customer service or business is conducted by the permittee must be legibly and prominently posted upon the vending machine. The director shall cancel the permit should the permittee remove vending machines, except as provided in this section. The cost of any removal must be borne by the permittee. The permittee, at the permittee’s own expense, must restore the site the machine formerly occupied to the satisfaction of the director. For purposes of this section, “vending machine” means any device that allows access to a newspaper, magazine, beverage, concession, or other item for public consumption or use. For purposes of this section, “permittee” means any person or organization, including any corporation, partnership, firm, or any other legal entity capable of owning property and transacting business, which has applied for a permit under this chapter. For purposes of this section, “notice” consists of a written communication and must be deemed to have occurred within seventy-two hours of mailing, if mailed within North Dakota, or one hundred twenty hours of mailing, if mailed outside North Dakota. “Notice” to a vendor of the condition of a vending machine also occurs if a period of time greater than the required inspection interval for the vending machines has passed.

     <p>
      The superintendent, the assistant superintendent, and the patrolmen constitute the highway patrol. The highway patrol shall enforce the provisions of the laws of this state relating to the protection and use of highways and shall patrol the highways and cooperate with sheriffs and police in enforcing the laws regulating the operation of vehicles and the use of highways. All patrolmen and the assistant superintendent must be appointed by the superintendent. Each patrolman appointed is deemed a probationary employee for an initial period of six months, during which the patrolman must be placed under probationary training and service and is subject to an extension of an additional period of six months or dismissal at the will of the superintendent or the superintendent’s designee. At the end of the probationary period, a probationary employee must either be taken off probationary status or dismissed. A nonprobationary employee employed in a regular, classified position is subject to removal for cause by the superintendent or the superintendent’s designee, but the employee may appeal a dismissal under chapter 54-44.3 provided the removal of the assistant superintendent from the assistant superintendent position does not entitle that person to appeal the removal unless that person also is dismissed from the patrol.

        Reasonable Suspicion.

      </p>
      <p>
       When a patrol officer testified that he clocked a driver traveling at 36 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour zone, the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop the driver. It was not necessary to provide evidence that the radar was working properly or that the officer was certified to operate the radar device. Although N.D.C.C. § 39-03-15 requires the results of a radar speed check be accepted as prima facie evidence of the speed of the motor vehicle, the officer’s testimony was not offered for purposes of establishing a conviction for a speeding violation but was instead offered to establish that a reasonable person in the officer’s position would be justified by some objective manifestation to suspect potential unlawful activity.

    Military service under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act — Member retirement credit.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A member re-employed under the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994, as amended [Pub. L. 103-353Pub. L. 103-353; 108 Stat. 3150; 38 U.S.C. 4301-4333], is entitled to receive retirement credit for the period of qualified military service. The required contribution for the credit, including payment for retiree health benefits, must be made in the same manner and by the same party as would have been made had the employee been continuously employed. If the salary the member would have received during the period of service is not reasonably certain, the member’s average rate of compensation during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the member’s period of service or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding that period, times the number of months of credit being purchased must be used. Employees must be allowed up to three times the period of military service or five years, whichever is less, to make any required payments. This provision applies to all qualifying periods of military service since October 1, 1994. Effective for years after December 31, 2008, compensation for purposes of Internal Revenue Code section 415 [26 U.S.C. 415], as amended, includes military differential wage payments, as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 3401(h) [26 U.S.C. 3401(h)], as amended. Any payments made by the member to receive qualifying credit inconsistent with this provision must be refunded. Employees shall make application to the employer for credit and provide a DD Form 214 to verify service. After December 31, 2006, if a participating member dies while performing qualified military service, as defined in section 414(u)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 414(u)(5)], as amended, the deceased member’s beneficiaries are entitled to any death benefits, other than credit for years of service for purposes of benefits, which would have been provided under the plan if the participating member had resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of death. The period of that member’s qualified military service is treated as vesting service under the plan.

    Retirement benefit.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Each contributor whose employment with the highway patrol has been terminated may apply to the board for retirement benefits according to this section and rules adopted by the board consistent with this chapter. The following procedures apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c39-03.1s39-03.1-11ol11">
       A contributor is entitled to credit for permanent employment or its equivalent from the date eligibility is attained until normal or postponed retirement date, as described in subsection 3.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-03.1s39-03.1-11ol12">
       Retirement benefits are based on the contributor’s final average salary. Final average salary is the average of the highest salary received by the contributor for any thirty-six months employed during the last one hundred twenty months of employment. For contributors who terminate employment on or after August 1, 2010, final average salary is the average of the highest salary received by the contributor for any thirty-six months employed during the last one hundred eighty months of employment. For contributors who terminate employment between July 31, 2005, and August 1, 2010, final average salary is the average of the highest salary received by the member for any thirty-six months employed during the period for which the board has appropriate and accurate salary records on its electronic database, but that period may not be more than the last one hundred eighty months of employment. For members who terminate employment after December 31, 2019, final average salary is the higher of the final average salary calculated on December 31, 2019, or the average salary earned in the three highest periods of twelve consecutive months employed during the last one hundred eighty months of employment. Months without earnings are excluded for the purpose of computing an average. If the contributor has worked for less than thirty-six months at the postponed retirement date, the final average salary is the average salary for all months of employment.

Contributors who have delayed or inadvertently failed to apply for retirement benefits to commence on their normal retirement date may choose to receive either a lump sum payment equal to the amount of missed payments, or an actuarial increase to the form of benefit the member has selected, which increase must reflect the missed payments. The final average salary used for calculating deferred vested retirement benefits must be increased annually, from the later of the date of termination of employment or July 1, 1991, until the date the contributor begins to receive retirement benefits from the fund, at a rate as determined by the board not to exceed a rate that would be approximately equal to annual salary increases provided state employees pursuant to action by the legislative assembly.

If one or more of the primary beneficiaries has predeceased the contributor, the board shall pay the predeceased beneficiary’s share to the remaining primary beneficiaries. If there are no remaining primary beneficiaries, the board shall pay the contributor’s account balance to the contingent beneficiaries in the same manner.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly in recognition of the value of good employer-employee relationships and the need to recruit and retain qualified highway patrolmen in this state, hereby declares its intent that the state should provide the comparable contribution for retirement of highway patrolmen’s retirement system members as it provides for other state employees. It is the further intent of the legislative assembly that because of the increase in state contributions to the North Dakota highway patrolmen’s retirement system, the members of such system shall not obligate the state to additional payments for federal social security benefits for such members.

     <p>
      A member is entitled to credit in the retirement system for each month of unused sick leave, as certified by the employer, if the member or the member’s employer pays an amount equal to the member’s final average salary, times the number of months of sick leave converted, times the employer and employee contribution, plus the required contribution for the retiree health benefits program. Hours of sick leave equal to a fraction of a month are deemed to be a full month for purposes of conversion to service credit. A member may convert all of the member’s certified sick leave or a part of that person’s certified sick leave.

     <p>
      A resident factory representative of any motor vehicle manufacturer may procure from the director a manufacturer’s plate, which must be designed by the director, for a fee of one hundred fifty dollars, which fee is for a twelve-month period. If such plate is procured at other than the beginning of the registration period, such fees must be prorated on a monthly basis. The procurement of such manufacturer’s plate by a factory representative is in lieu of the payment of any other registration fees, sales tax, or use tax on the motor vehicle used by the factory representative in the course of employment for the period for which the manufacturer’s plate is current and valid. The manufacturer’s plate may not be used by any person other than the representative to whom it was issued, nor may such plate be used on any vehicle other than that vehicle used by the factory representative in the course of employment. Upon the sale of the vehicle for which such manufacturer’s plate was issued, the plate must be retained by the factory representative and used upon replacement vehicles subsequently acquired from the manufacturer for use in the course of employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the foregoing provisions, a manufacturer of motor vehicles is entitled to use a manufacturer plate on its demonstration vehicles. Such plate must be issued in the name of the manufacturer and must be used solely for demonstration purposes only by the registrant or its designated employees.

The motor vehicle is eligible for collector’s registration if it is owned and operated solely as a collector’s item and if the owner owns another motor vehicle the owner uses for general transportation. A motor vehicle qualifies as a collector’s item under this section only if it is operated on public streets and highways for the purpose of driving the vehicle to and from active entry and participation in parades, car shows, car rallies, other public gatherings held for the purpose of displaying or selling the vehicle, and to and from service or storage facilities. An applicant for registration of a vehicle as a collector’s motor vehicle shall file an affidavit with the director that states the owner’s name and address, the make, year, and the manufacturer’s identification number of the motor vehicle, and a statement that the motor vehicle is owned and operated solely as a collector’s item and not for general transportation purposes. If the director is satisfied that the affidavit is true and correct, the director shall register the motor vehicle as a collector’s motor vehicle on the payment of a registration fee of sixty dollars. The registration is valid as long as the collector’s motor vehicle is owned by the person who applied for the registration under this section. The director shall design and issue distinctive number plates for collector’s motor vehicles registered under this section. In lieu of the distinctive number plates, the owner of the motor vehicle, at the discretion of the director, may display on the motor vehicle number plates from the year in which the motor vehicle was manufactured. The number plates from the year of manufacture may not be used in lieu of distinctive number plates when it would create a duplication of a number in the recordkeeping system of the department. Number plates from the year of manufacture must be legible and must be restored to the satisfaction of the department. A person violating this section or a department rule regarding this section forfeits the right to the registration provided in this section and any registration fees that have been paid.

      Unless otherwise provided by law, an individual may not operate a vehicle on a public highway of this state unless the vehicle has a distinctive number assigned to the vehicle by the department, and two number plates, bearing the distinctive number conspicuously displayed, horizontally and in an upright position, one on the front and one on the rear of the vehicle, each securely fastened, except number plates assigned to a house trailer must be attached to the rear of the house trailer. Number plates assigned to a motorcycle or trailer must be attached to the rear of the motorcycle or trailer and may be displayed vertically. When only one number plate is furnished for an apportioned vehicle registered under the international registration plan as authorized in section 39-19-04, truck tractor, or semitrailer, the plate must be attached to the front of the apportioned vehicle or truck tractor and the rear of the semitrailer. The bottom of each number plate must be at a height of not less than twelve inches [30.48 centimeters] above the level surface upon which the vehicle stands. Each plate must be mounted in a visible manner that clearly displays the distinctive number assigned to the vehicle and the name of the state on the plate. As far as is reasonably possible, the plates must at all times be kept free and clear of mud, ice, or snow so as to be clearly visible and all number plates, markers, or evidence of registration or licensing except for the current year must be removed from the vehicle. All vehicle license plates issued by the department are the property of the department for the period for which the plates are valid. An annual registration tab or sticker for the current registration year must be displayed on each number plate, in the area designated by the department for the tab or sticker, in those years for which tabs or stickers are issued in lieu of number plates.

        Violation As Basis for Investigative Stop.

       District court incorrectly determined the stop of defendant’s vehicle violated her constitutional right against unreasonable seizure,
   U.S. Const. amend. IV and
   N.D. Const. art. I, § 8, as the deputy had an objectively reasonable basis to stop defendant for violating
   N.D.C.C. § 39-04-11 because her vehicle displayed expired registration tabs.

      </p>
      <p>
       Displaying an expired registration tag on a license plate in violation of N.D.C.C. § 39-04-11 was sufficient to justify a police officer’s stop of the vehicle because even a minor traffic violation could provide the requisite basis for an investigative stop.

         Reasonable Suspicion to Stop.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant’s vehicle, because the officer’s knowledge of the prior driver’s license suspension one month earlier was not too stale to support a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity, and the officer observed defendant operating a vehicle with no license plates and no viewable registration sticker.
   State v. Skarsgard, 2007 ND 160, 739 N.W.2d 786, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a DUI case, denial of defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained during a traffic stop was proper because the vehicle, without license plates and only with an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper in the rear window, provided a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify stopping the vehicle; the officer did not recognize the sheet of paper as an authentic temporary registration certificate, from the state or another state, and thus he had reasonable grounds to stop the driver and check if the driver had a valid temporary registration certificate in his possession in accordance with state law.
   City of Grand Forks v. Mitchell, 2008 ND 5, 743 N.W.2d 800, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 39-04-17 did not insulate all vehicles displaying a certificate from reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a stop; an officer may constitutionally stop a vehicle despite the vehicle’s display of a temporary registration certificate, so long as the officer could point to specific, articulable facts sufficient to create an objective basis for reasonable suspicion.

        North Dakota Department of Transportation had authority under N.D.C.C. § 39-22-04 to suspend the car dealer’s motor vehicle dealer’s license for willfully violating N.D.C.C. § 39-04-17, it had the authority to consider past suspensions, and the finding that the dealer willfully violated N.D.C.C. § 39-04-17 was supported by the evidence.

       <p>
        Officer did not have a reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify stop of defendant’s vehicle, and, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment and N.D. Const. art. I, § 8, the trial court improperly denied defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the search of the vehicle where there was no evidence of erratic driving or speeding, and the temporary registration sticker displayed on the vehicle pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 39-04-17 did not appear to be unusual. The officer had stopped the vehicle because, in his experience, many people drove on the sticker beyond the 30 days that was allotted; however, the officer’s belief that many people violated the 30-day temporary registration law was an over-generalization that did not give rise to reasonable suspicion that defendant’s automobile was not lawfully registered.
   State v. Johnson, 2006 ND 248, 724 N.W.2d 129, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly refused to suppress evidence obtained during searches of defendant and his vehicle where an officer personally observed a possible vehicle registration violation in that the temporary registration certificate displayed on the vehicle had no visible printing on it, which was indicative of a temporary certificate that was more than 30 days old in violation of N.D.C.C. § 39-04-17; because defendant then fled when officers commanded him to stop, the subsequent searches of defendant and the vehicle were incident to his arrest for fleeing a peace officer.

        Court properly granted summary judgment in favor of an insurer in a declaratory judgment action to determine the applicability of an exception to a motor vehicle exclusion in a farmer’s policy for vehicles primarily used as farm implements.
   The farmer’s semi-truck did not fit within the exception to the policy exclusion because the semi-truck was not both designed for and primarily used as a farm implement, the primary purpose of the design of the truck was to transport cargo for long distances, and, under the plain language of the policy, the farmer’s use of the truck made it subject to motor vehicle registration requirements.

If the number plate has become lost, stolen, or mutilated, the transferor may apply for duplicate plates. The department may establish procedures that permit the transferor to assign the credit to the transferee if the transferor is the spouse, a sibling, or a lineal ancestor or descendant of the transferee.

The certificate must be printed on the reverse side of each vehicle registration card and must be available to the transferee from licensed vehicle dealers, law enforcement agencies, and motor vehicle branch offices. The vehicle may be operated for five days from date of purchase without a plate or certificate of ownership if dated evidence of ownership is carried in the vehicle.

       Where error made in distribution of moneys to counties resulted in some counties receiving too large a share and others too small a share but where state retained no part of the moneys, no action against state arose in favor of county which received less than it was entitled to. Stark County v. State, 160 N.W.2d 101, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1968).

      <p>
       Where some counties through a mistake received excess distribution of fees while others received too small a portion, those counties which received less than they were entitled to could proceed to recover moneys due them from counties which had received excess under theory of unjust enrichment. Richland County v. State, 180 N.W.2d 649, 1970 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1970).

       Any owner of a motor vehicle licensed in this state, if such vehicle is permanently and involuntarily destroyed, may during the same year or following year claim a refund in an amount equal to the unused portion of the fee paid, less five dollars, upon the vehicle so destroyed, computed pro rata by the month, one-twelfth of the annual fee paid for each month of the year remaining after the month in which such vehicle was so destroyed, provided the number plates, registration card, and certificate of title are returned to the department. If the number plates or registration card assigned to the vehicle are destroyed, a refund may be obtained upon furnishing information of such fact satisfactory to the department. Upon receiving the certificate of title, the department shall issue a salvage certificate of title.

       If a vehicle is withdrawn from a proportionally registered fleet during the period for which it is registered, the registrant of the fleet shall notify the department. The department may require surrender of cab cards and other identification devices with respect to the vehicle. If a vehicle is permanently withdrawn from a proportionally registered fleet because it has been destroyed, sold, or otherwise completely removed from the service of the fleet operator, the unused portion of the fees paid with respect to the vehicle must be applied against liability of the fleet operator for subsequent additions to the fleet during the registration year or for additional fees upon audit. If at the end of the registration year there remains an unused portion of fees paid with respect to the permanently withdrawn vehicles, the unused fees must be applied against registration fees for the registration year immediately following the year during which the vehicles were permanently withdrawn. The used portion of fees of a vehicle permanently withdrawn from a fleet is a sum equal to the amount paid with respect to the vehicle when it was first proportionally registered in the registration year, reduced by one-twelfth of the total annual proportional registration fee applicable to the vehicle for each calendar month of the registration year including the month the notice of withdrawal is received by the department, except that no unused portion of fees of less than five dollars may be considered or applied. If an unused portion of fees cannot be applied against registration fees for the registration year immediately following, an application for refund of the unused portion may be made to the department, which shall adopt rules as may be required for payment of the refund.

       Section 39-04-55 was created by section 1 of chapter 295, 1973 S.L. and section 2 of the same chapter 295 repealed section 39-05-12, which contained the provisions which comprised new section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-04s39-04-55" target="_self">39-04-55</a></cite>. The effect of the repeal and enactment was to remove the law from the chapter on title registration and to place it in the chapter on motor vehicle registration. Section 39-05-12 was amended by section 17 of chapter 301, 1973 S.L. and, since the identical provisions which were in section 39-05-12 were transferred to section 39-04-55, the amendment in chapter 301 has been harmonized with the latter section in order to give effect to both actions of the Legislative Assembly pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.01.html#t01c1-02s1-02-09" target="_blank">1-02-09</a></cite>.1.

       Moneys in the public transportation fund must be disbursed under guidelines issued by the director. The funds must be used by transportation providers to establish and maintain public transportation, especially for the elderly and handicapped, and may be used to contract to provide public transportation, as matching funds to procure money from other sources for public transportation and for other expenditures authorized by the director. Moneys in the public transportation fund are appropriated to the department of transportation on a continuing basis for distributions authorized under this section.

      <li id="t39c39-04.2s39-04.2-04ol12">
       Each county shall receive a base amount of four-tenths of one percent of the appropriation for the program plus one dollar and fifty cents per capita of population in the county, based upon the latest regular or special official federal census. Each year the director shall increase or decrease the one dollar and fifty cents per capita amount in order to distribute all funds appropriated for the biennium. If there are multiple transportation providers in one county, then the base amount must be divided equally among the providers and the additional per capita amount must be based upon the percentage of elderly and handicapped ridership provided by each transportation provider within the county. Funds not expended by a county during a contract period, or previous contract periods, may be redistributed under guidelines established by the director. In addition, unexpended funds may also be used by the director for transit coordination purposes.

As first lien holder the seller may retain possession of the certificate. This provision supports the proposition that possession of the certificate alone is sufficient to perfect a security interest under North Dakota law. In re Halvorson, 102 B.R. 736, 1989 Bankr.

       Department of transportation failed to cite any persuasive support for its assertion that documents were “regularly kept records of the director” merely because they had been placed in a driver’s file; other documents statutorily recognized as “regularly kept records” are required to bear far greater indicia of authentication and reliability.

       The director may suspend or revoke the operator’s license of any resident of this state or the privilege of a nonresident to operate a motor vehicle in this state upon receiving notice of the conviction of that individual in a tribal court or in another state of an offense, which if committed in this state would be grounds for the suspension or revocation of an operator’s license of an operator. The director may act on a report of a conviction in tribal court received from any tribal law enforcement agency. This section may not be construed as authorizing the assessment of points against a resident’s driving record in accordance with chapter 39-06.1, except upon conviction of a resident driver for a criminal offense in a tribal court or in another state which is equivalent to one of those offenses defined in section 39-06.1-05. A suspension or revocation may not be imposed for convictions for driving under suspension or revocation on an Indian reservation or in another state if a valid operator’s license from this state was in effect at the time of the violation. For purposes of this section, originals, photostatic copies, and electronic transmissions of the records of the driver’s licensing or other authority of the other jurisdiction are sufficient evidence even if not certified copies.

The suspension continues until the resident furnishes evidence satisfactory to the director of the resident’s compliance with the laws of the Indian reservation or the other state relating to the deposit of security or payment of a judgment arising out of a motor vehicle accident, to the extent that compliance would be required if the accident had occurred in this state.

        Although the loss of a license for one year is a serious sanction, that sanction is regulatory, rather than punitive, and does not support the characterization of the proceeding as criminal. Holen v. Hjelle, 396 N.W.2d 290, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 437</cite> (N.D. 1986).

Ct. 1586 (1971) before a driver’s license can be revoked by the state, is satisfied where the licensee has been convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor; such conviction adjudicates the issue of guilt and determines the issue of revocation.

        The holding in Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 29 L. Ed. 2d 90, 91 S. Ct. 1586 (1971) made the question of liability as the result of an automobile accident an important factor in the state’s determination to deprive a person of his driver’s license and vehicle registration. The supreme court of the United States found the Georgia Safety Responsibility Act was developed around a liability-related concept and, therefore, the state may not consistently, with due process, eliminate consideration of the factor of liability in its hearing before suspension.

Actual notice of the opportunity for a hearing under this section must be deemed to have occurred seventy-two hours after the notice is mailed by regular mail.

        Driver had rebutted the presumption that the Drivers License Division Director had authority to certify Department of Transportation records where, on the date of the certification, the Director was on administrative leave due to suspected workplace misconduct, thereby making it more probable than not that the Director’s authority had been suspended. Christianson v. Henke, 2020 ND 76, 941 N.W.2d 529, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        By establishing the Drivers License Division Director was on administrative leave when certification was made, the burden shifted to the Department to either prove the Director had certification authority or proffer evidence authenticating the records. Since the Department did neither, the hearing officer abused his discretion by admitting the file as its authenticity was not established. Because the Department relied on inadmissible evidence to suspend the driver’s driving privileges, its decision was not in accordance with the law. Christianson v. Henke, 2020 ND 76, 941 N.W.2d 529, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        District court properly affirmed the Department of Transportation’s revocation of a driver’s driving privileges because the hearing file was properly admitted as a self-authenticating copy of an official record, an interim division director’s authority to certify Department records was presumed since there was no oath requirement for record custodians, nor was there a requirement that copies of Department records be certified as correct by an employee acting in a director capacity.

     <p>
      An individual whose operator’s license has been revoked is not entitled to have the operator’s license renewed or restored unless the revocation was for a cause which has been removed, except that after the expiration of the revocation period the individual may make application for a new license, but the director may not then issue a new license unless the director is satisfied after investigation of the individual’s driving records, driving habits, and driving ability of the individual that it will be safe to grant an operator’s license to that individual. An individual whose operator’s license has been revoked must pay to the director a revocation reinstatement fee as listed in section 39-06-49, in addition to any license renewal fee, for issuance of a new license. If the individual submits payment of a reinstatement fee with a check, credit card, or debit card and the individual stops payment on the transaction, the director shall reimpose a suspension until the director receives proper payment. A reinstatement fee is not required if a revoked license is reinstated due to the findings of a hearing, re-examination of hearing, or court or judicial review as provided under chapter 39-06, 39-06.1, or 39-20.

         Collateral Attack on License Suspension.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        At trial on charge of driving while driver’s license suspended, defendant could not collaterally attack the validity of the suspension of his license where he had been notified of his right to a hearing on the suspension, he failed to make a written request for a hearing, he was notified that his license was suspended, and he surrendered his license to the proper authorities without contesting the validity of the suspension. State v. Mehlhoff, 318 N.W.2d 314, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The validity of a driver’s license suspension may not be collaterally attacked at a trial for driving under suspension (DUS); the proper time to challenge the validity of a driver’s license suspension is at a hearing on the suspension. Thus, where the defendant elected not to challenge the validity of the suspension of his license at a hearing on the suspension, he could not mount a collateral attack on the suspension in a DUS proceeding. State v. Larson, 419 N.W.2d 897, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        Although this section requires an official to “certify” admission of the violation to the licensing authority, it does not require a more formal notification than N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-03, which requires hearing officer to “notify” licensing authority of the violation, or N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-04, which requires the official to “report” the violation to the licensing authority; notation on the reverse side of traffic citation for speeding which contained “Stat. Fee”, indicating the amount of fee paid, “Jul 24 1979”, indicating the day the fee was paid or the citation processed, and the name of the judge, indicating the disposition occurred in his court, was sufficient to meet the requirements under this section for informing the licensing authority of a traffic violation admission or adjudication.

The fact that an individual has admitted a violation, or has, in any proceeding, been found to have committed a violation, may not be referred to in any way, nor be admissible as evidence in any court, civil, equity, or criminal, except in an action or proceeding involving that individual’s operator’s license.

If, after trial in the appellate court, the individual is again found to have committed the violation, there is no further appeal. Notice of appeal under this subsection must be given within thirty days after a finding of commission of a violation is entered by the official. Oral notice of appeal may be given to the official at the time that the official adjudges that a violation has been committed. Otherwise, notice of appeal must be in writing and filed with the official, and a copy of the notice must be served upon the prosecuting attorney.

      An application for a stay or temporary certificate under this subdivision must be accompanied by a certified copy of the appellant’s driving record, for the furnishing of which the director may charge a fee of three dollars. Any order granting a stay or a temporary certificate must be immediately forwarded by the clerk of court to the director, who immediately shall issue a temporary certificate in accordance with the order in the manner provided by law. A court may not make a determination on an application under this subdivision without notice to the appropriate prosecuting attorney. An individual who violates or exceeds the restrictions contained in any temporary restricted driving certificate issued under this subdivision is guilty of a traffic violation and must be assessed a fee of twenty dollars.

        This section does not authorize appeals to the supreme court from decisions of the district court or county court of increased jurisdiction on substantive or procedural matters involved in certain traffic violations.

        Court lacked jurisdiction to consider a driver’s appeal from a district court’s judgment finding him guilty of speeding in violation of a municipal ordinance, after a municipal court also found the driver guilty, because N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-03 provided for an appeal from the municipal court to the district court for trial anew, but prohibited any further appeal.

        Supreme Court of North Dakota lacked jurisdiction over a municipal court judgment denying petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief after he pled guilty to driving under suspension and driving without liability insurance, because the appeal was not authorized by statute. Under
   N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-03(5)(a), a person may not appeal a finding from a district judge or magistrate that the person committed the traffic violation; clearly, there was no appeal to the Supreme Court.

      If an individual fails to choose one of the methods of proceeding in section 39-06.1-02 or 39-06.1-03, the individual is deemed to have admitted to commission of the charged violation, and the official having jurisdiction shall report the admission to the director within ten days after the date set for the hearing. Failure to appear at the time designated, after signing a promise to appear, if signing is required by law, or failure to appear without paying the statutory fee or posting and forfeiting bond is a class B misdemeanor. Failure to appear without just cause at the hearing is deemed an admission of commission of the charged violation.

        Subdivision 3.1(a), imposing additional requirements for reinstatement of a driver’s license when suspension is for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, is clear and unambiguous and is not unconstitutionally vague. State v. Bettenhausen, 460 N.W.2d 394, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The number of points assigned to licensee’s driving record should be in accordance with the statute in effect at the time of commission of the offense rather than the statute in effect at the time of sentence. State v. Goodbird, 344 N.W.2d 483, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court does not have authority to assign points to licensee’s driving record upon conviction; court’s responsibility is to report the conviction to the highway commissioner who, upon receipt of the report of the conviction, has the duty to enter the proper number of points on the licensee’s driving record. State v. Goodbird, 344 N.W.2d 483, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 1984).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Individual who did not request an administrative hearing to challenge the validity of his evaluation, nor seek another evaluation, was in no position to challenge either the division’s reliance on the evaluation by his addiction counselor or the division’s reliance on his failure to file another evaluation by an addiction counselor that would satisfy the statutory requirement. State v. Bettenhausen, 460 N.W.2d 394, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        An affidavit of mailing stating that an order of suspension was mailed to a licensee on a certain date was sufficient to establish constructive delivery of the order forty-eight hours after the stated date without further proof that the licensee received the order.

        The unambiguous language of this statute authorizes a reduction of points only from a point total accumulated prior to the completion of driver training instruction; therefore, a driver could not use a defensive driving course taken after his conviction but before Department of Transportation added points to his record to reduce those points.

        Where it was undisputed that defendant had not paid the reinstatement fee, had not furnished an addiction treatment statement, and had not submitted proof of financial responsibility, the driver’s license division did not err in failing to reduce the number of points against defendant’s license to eleven after his license had been suspended for ninety-one days pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-12 or subsection 1 of this section.

       <p>
        Suspension of a driver’s license in 1990 was a conviction under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8) and N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) because a transportation department was an authorized administrative tribunal under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8), and the definition of conviction under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) was used instead of the definition of conviction in
   N.D.C.C. § 39-06-30 since N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) was the more specific statute; therefore, a lifetime suspension of a commercial license was proper for two driving under the influence convictions. Bienek v. DOT, 2007 ND 117, 736 N.W.2d 492, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Definition of “conviction” in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) is a special provision applicable to commercial driver’s licenses that conflicts with the definition of “conviction” in N.D.C.C. § 39-06-30, a general provision applicable to motor vehicle operator’s licenses; under statutory construction principles, the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) prevails over the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-06s39-06-30" target="_self">39-06-30</a></cite>. Therefore, the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) must be used when interpreting N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8).
   Bienek v. DOT, 2007 ND 117, 736 N.W.2d 492, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(7) was not void for vagueness due to differing definitions of “conviction” in N.D.C.C. §§ 39-06.2-02(8) and 39-06-30 (repealed) because it had been unambiguously held that a “conviction,” for suspension purposes, could arise from an administrative decision, and this judicial determination was considered when deciding if the public had notice of proscribed conduct. Hamre v. N.D. DOT, 2014 ND 23, 842 N.W.2d 865, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative suspension of a driver’s noncommercial driving privileges was a “conviction,” under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(7), for purposes of disqualifying the driver’s commercial driver’s license, because (1) N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8)’ s special provision defining “conviction” as administrative tribunal determinations had to be used when considering the driver’s first DUI conviction, and (2) the driver’s license’s administrative suspension was separate from criminal proceedings on the driver’s dismissed DUI charge. Hamre v. N.D. DOT, 2014 ND 23, 842 N.W.2d 865, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        District court erred in affirming a North Dakota Department of Transportation (DOT) decision disqualifying a driver's commercial driving privileges for 60 days because the statute at issue only referred to convictions for the calculation of the three-year time period in which the DOT could disqualify commercial driving privileges for serious traffic violations, there was no reference to the commission of a violation as a triggering event for calculating this time period.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Definition of “conviction” in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) is a special provision applicable to commercial driver’s licenses that conflicts with the definition of “conviction” in N.D.C.C. § 39-06-30, a general provision applicable to motor vehicle operator’s licenses; under statutory construction principles, the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) prevails over the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-06s39-06-30" target="_self">39-06-30</a></cite>. Therefore, the definition of “conviction” found in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) must be used when interpreting N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8).
   Bienek v. DOT, 2007 ND 117, 736 N.W.2d 492, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(7) was not void for vagueness due to differing definitions of “conviction” in N.D.C.C. §§ 39-06.2-02(8) and 39-06-30 (repealed) because it had been unambiguously held that a “conviction,” for suspension purposes, could arise from an administrative decision, and this judicial determination was considered when deciding if the public had notice of proscribed conduct. Hamre v. N.D. DOT, 2014 ND 23, 842 N.W.2d 865, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 2014).

       <p>
        Administrative suspension of a driver’s noncommercial driving privileges was a “conviction,” under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(7), for purposes of disqualifying the driver’s commercial driver’s license, because (1) N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8)’ s special provision defining “conviction” as administrative tribunal determinations had to be used when considering the driver’s first DUI conviction, and (2) the driver’s license’s administrative suspension was separate from criminal proceedings on the driver’s dismissed DUI charge.

        Department of transportation’s application of N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8) was not retroactive merely because defendant’s first DUI conviction in 2000 occurred before the effective date of subsection; it was his second DUI offense that occurred after the effective date of subsection in 2003 that triggered the 99 year suspension of his commercial driver’s license.

        Fact that one driving under the influence (DUI) conviction was entered before the enactment of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act did not matter since the second DUI conviction triggered a lifetime suspension.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Suspension of a driver’s license in 1990 was a conviction under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8) and N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) because a transportation department was an authorized administrative tribunal under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-10(8), and the definition of conviction under N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) was used instead of the definition of conviction in
   N.D.C.C. § 39-06-30 since N.D.C.C. § 39-06.2-02(8) was the more specific statute; therefore, a lifetime suspension of a commercial license was proper for two driving under the influence convictions.

      The time to be specified in the summons or notice provided for in section 39-07-07 must be within thirty-five days after the issuance of the summons or notice or earlier if so ordered by the magistrate of the city or county having jurisdiction over the offense or if the person halted demands an earlier hearing. If the person halted desires, the person may have the right, at a convenient hour, to an immediate hearing or to a hearing within twenty-four hours. The hearing must be before a magistrate of the city or county in which the offense was committed. If an immediate hearing is demanded, a district judge serving the county, with the consent of the respective prosecuting attorneys, may order the hearing to be held in any of the counties in which the district judge has jurisdiction, rather than in the county where the offense was allegedly committed. Upon the receipt from the person halted of a written promise to appear at the time and place mentioned in the summons or notice, the officer shall release the person from custody. Any person refusing to give a written promise to appear must be taken immediately by the halting officer before the nearest or most accessible magistrate, or to such other place or before such other person as may be provided by a statute or ordinance authorizing the giving of bail. Any person willfully violating the person’s written promise to appear is guilty of a class B misdemeanor, regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which the person originally was halted. The time limitations for a hearing as provided by this section do not preclude a recharging of the alleged violation if the person being charged receives a new summons or notice subject to the provisions of this section.

     <p>
      Every magistrate, as defined in section 29-01-14, shall keep a full record of every case brought before the magistrate in which a person is charged with a violation of chapter 12.1-16 resulting from the operation of a motor vehicle, or of any provision of chapters 39-05 through 39-13, 39-21, and 39-24, or with a violation of a municipal ordinance which is equivalent to any of the provisions of the foregoing statutes. Within ten days after a final order or judgment of conviction, for a violation not subject to disposition and reporting under chapter 39-06.1, by the North Dakota supreme court or any lower court having jurisdiction, provided that no appeal is pending and the time for filing a notice of appeal has elapsed, the magistrate then having jurisdiction shall forward a report of that fact to the licensing authority. If the reported violation caused another person’s serious bodily injury, as defined in section 12.1-01-04, the magistrate shall include that information in the report. Any conviction for which a report is received by the licensing authority may be deemed by the licensing authority to be final, and the licensing authority may take any action authorized by law to be taken based on the report. Subject to the filing of an appeal, a conviction includes those instances when:

The minimum penalty for violating this section is as provided in subsection 5.

The offender shall deliver the number plates to the court without delay at a time certain as ordered by the court following the conviction. The court shall deliver the number plates to the office and notify the department of the order. An offender who does not provide the number plates to the court at the appropriate time is subject to revocation of probation. The court may make an exception to this subsection, on an individual basis, to avoid undue hardship to an individual who is completely dependent on the motor vehicle for the necessities of life, including a family member of the convicted individual and a co-owner of the motor vehicle, or if the offender is participating in the twenty-four seven sobriety program.

           In addition, for a first offense when the convicted person has an alcohol concentration of at least sixteen one-hundredths of one percent by weight, the offense is an aggravated first offense and the sentence must include a fine of at least seven hundred fifty dollars and at least two days’ imprisonment.

         If the offense is subject to subdivision a or b, a municipal court or district court may not suspend a sentence, but may convert each day of a term of imprisonment to ten hours of community service for an offense subject to paragraph 2 of subdivision a. If the offense is subject to subdivision c, the district court may suspend a sentence, except for sixty days’ imprisonment, under subsection 3 of section 12.1-32-02 on the condition that the defendant first undergo and complete an evaluation for alcohol and substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation. If the offense is subject to subdivision d, the district court may suspend a sentence, except for one year’s imprisonment, under subsection 3 of section 12.1-32-02 on the condition that the defendant first undergo and complete an evaluation for alcohol and substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation. If the defendant is found to be in need of alcohol and substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation, the district court may order the defendant placed under the supervision and management of the department of corrections and rehabilitation and is subject to the conditions of probation under section 12.1-32-07. The district court may require the defendant to complete alcohol and substance abuse treatment and rehabilitation under the direction of the drug court program as a condition of probation in accordance with rules adopted by the supreme court. The district court may terminate probation under this section when the defendant completes the drug treatment program. If the district court finds that a defendant has failed to undergo an evaluation or complete treatment or has violated any condition of probation, the district court shall revoke the defendant’s probation and shall sentence the defendant in accordance with this subsection.

         If the penalty mandated by this section includes imprisonment or placement upon conviction of a violation of this section or equivalent ordinance, and if an addiction evaluation has indicated that the defendant needs treatment, the court may order the defendant to undergo treatment at an appropriate licensed addiction treatment program under subdivision g of subsection 1 of section 12.1-32-02 and the time spent by the defendant in the treatment must be credited as a portion of a sentence of imprisonment or placement under this section. A court may not order the department of corrections and rehabilitation to be responsible for the costs of treatment in a private treatment facility.

        <li id="t39c39-08s39-08-01ol15i">
         If the court sentences an individual to the legal and physical custody of the department of corrections and rehabilitation, the department may place the individual in an alcohol treatment program designated by the department. Upon the individual’s successful completion of the alcohol treatment program, the department shall release the individual from imprisonment to begin the court-ordered period of probation. If there is not any court-ordered period of probation, the court may order the individual to serve the remainder of the sentence of imprisonment on supervised probation and the terms and conditions must include participation in the twenty-four seven sobriety program and any terms and conditions of probation previously imposed by the court. Probation under this subsection may include placement in another facility or treatment program. If an individual is placed in another facility or treatment program after release from imprisonment, the remainder of the individual’s sentence of imprisonment must be considered time spent in custody. Individuals incarcerated under this section subsequent to a second probation revocation are not eligible for release from imprisonment upon the successful completion of treatment.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c39-08s39-08-01ol15j">
         If the individual has participated in the twenty-four seven sobriety program as a condition of pretrial release or for the purpose of receiving a temporary restricted operator’s license under section 39-06.1-11, the sentencing court may give credit for the time the individual has already served on the twenty-four seven sobriety program when determining the amount of time the individual must serve on the twenty-four seven sobriety program for the purposes of probation, if that individual has not violated the twenty-four seven sobriety program before sentencing.

      <li id="t39c39-08s39-08-01ol16">
       As used in subdivisions b and c of subsection 5, the term “imprisonment” includes house arrest. As a condition of house arrest, a defendant may not consume alcoholic beverages. The house arrest must include a program of electronic home detention and the defendant shall participate in the twenty-four seven sobriety program. The defendant shall defray all costs associated with the electronic home detention. For an offense under subdivision b or c of subsection 5, no more than ninety percent of the sentence may be house arrest.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-08s39-08-01ol17">
       As used in this title, participation in the twenty-four seven sobriety program under chapter 54-12 means compliance with sections 54-12-27 through 54-12-31, and requires sobriety breath testing twice per day seven days per week or electronic alcohol monitoring, urine testing, or drug patch testing. The offender is responsible for all twenty-four seven sobriety program fees and the court may not waive the fees. For purposes of this section, the twenty-four seven sobriety program is a condition of probation and a court may not order participation in the program as part of the sentence. If an individual ordered to participate in the twenty-four seven program is not a resident of this state, that individual shall enroll in a twenty-four seven program or an alcohol compliance program if available in that individual’s state of residence and shall file proof of such enrollment.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The fact any person charged with violating this section is or has been legally entitled to use alcohol or other drugs or substances is not a defense against any charge for violating this section. It is an affirmative defense that a drug was used only as directed or cautioned by a practitioner who legally prescribed or dispensed the drug to that person. If the individual violated subdivisions a, b, c, or d of this subsection and subdivision e of this subsection and the violations arose from the same incident, for purposes of suspension or revocation of an operator’s license, the violations are deemed a single violation and the court shall forward to the department of transportation only the conviction for driving under the influence or actual physical control.

       <p>
        This statute provided adequate notice of proscribed conduct to defendant who was found intoxicated but unconscious behind the wheel of his parked car, and therefore, this section was not constitutionally vague as applied to that defendant. State v. Schwalk, 430 N.W.2d 317, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>

        The application of the offense of being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle to private property is not an unnecessary and unprotected intrusion upon private property. Persons in their houses or curtilages are still protected from unlawful search and seizure and from arrest without probable cause. Wiederholt v. Director, N.D.

        District court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the State of North Dakota’s motion to amend the charge against defendant and rejected the plea agreement because the court followed the legislative directive when it determined that the offense would been defendant’s fourth driving under the influence of alcohol offense, not defendant’s third. Furthermore, the court explained why the State negotiated the plea agreement and why the court rejected the agreement. State v. Louser, 2021 ND 89, 959 N.W.2d 883, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        District court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss her charge of DUI-Refusal under a municipal code; in arguing that subsection (1)(f) required advice of criminal penalties for refusing a chemical breath test to drivers before they could be prosecuted, defendant essentially asked the supreme court to restore the statutory exclusionary rule that was removed, but the supreme court declined to require that which the Legislature expressly eliminated when it amended the statute.

        District court properly found defendant guilty of actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence in violation of a municipal code because the relevant portion of the code was the equivalent to a violation the Century Code, neither of which specified a culpability requirement, defendant failed to show there were no other legal alternatives to violating the law inasmuch as there was no evidence defendant was prevented from returning to the party, borrowing another attendee’s phone to call for a ride, asking an attendee for a ride, or asking to stay at the home where the party was hosted.

        To convict under subdivision (1)(b) of this section, the state must prove that the defendant, while driving a motor vehicle on a public way, lacked the clearness of intellect and control of himself that he would otherwise have. This can be established without evidence of intoxilyzer test results. State v. Whitney, 377 N.W.2d 132, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 437</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Although subdivisions (1)(a) and (b) of this section represented different crimes and the complaint originally filed against defendant referenced only driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, which falls under subdivision (1)(b) of this section, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the complaint to be amended to add a count for driving with a blood alcohol concentration of .10 or greater under subdivision (1)(a) of this section where the amendment was served on defendant in advance of trial, defendant had demanded discovery regarding the results of the field chemical test performed on her, and defendant was prepared to defend against both charges at the time of trial.

        Defense set forth in N.D.C.C. § 39-08-01(1) protects a person only insofar as that person has been prescribed a drug, and has taken that drug as instructed by a physician.

        Defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence of drugs was supported by the evidence because, had Tramadol been the only drug found in defendant’s system at the time defendant was arrested, the exception in N.D.C.C. § 39-08-01(1) would have been a defense under the circumstances of the arrest. Defendant, however, tested positive for five different drugs, and the jury could have rationally concluded that the presence and combination of the drugs had caused the impairment.

       </h5>
       <p>
        While it is not necessary for the state to call all persons who have handled the blood sample in order to introduce the test results, it is incumbent upon the state to show that the sample tested is the same one originally drawn from the defendant; because the state failed to prove that the blood sample tested was the same one drawn from the defendant, the trial court erred in admitting the blood-alcohol test result as evidence. State v. Reil, 409 N.W.2d 99, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 359</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Where the officer failed to seal the vial with one layer of tape and label the vial with the name of the subject and the arresting officer as required by the state toxicologist for blood sample collection and submission and no testimony was provided by the state to verify that the blood sample tested was the same blood collected from the defendant, the trial court erred in admitting the results of the blood-alcohol test. State v. Nygaard, 426 N.W.2d 547, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a police officer failed to seal and label the blood vial as required, and failed to offer testimony to establish a chain of custody, the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the results of the blood-alcohol test. State v. Wright, 426 N.W.2d 3, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>
        For purposes of driving under the influence and actual physical control cases, certification by the state toxicologist that the blood testing equipment in his laboratory is “in good working order,” is not required to establish the foundation of blood test results.

       <p>
        Trial court abused its discretion in impliedly suppressing the results of second blood test and dismissing the charge without giving the state the opportunity to establish chain of custody through means other than unavailable chemist’s testimony, which unavailability did not, in itself, justify suppression of the results of the second blood test; the law does not require that the defendant have the right to subpoena a chemist when that chemist’s analysis is not used to show the defendant’s blood-alcohol content. State v. Zink, 519 N.W.2d 581, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>
        The statutorily-required foundation for the trial court’s admission of defendant’s blood-test result under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07 was properly established. State v. Asbridge, 555 N.W.2d 571, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting intoxilyzer test results as there was no requirement in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07 or the North Dakota State Toxicologist’s approved method that a standard solution be used for only 50 tests; whether more than 50 tests were conducted with the solution used for defendant’s test affected the weight, not the admissibility, of the test results.

       <p>
        North Dakota State Toxicologist’s analytical report and the directive therein that a standard solution could be used for up to 50 intoxilyzer tests is not a part of the approved method and proof of that fact is not a prerequisite to showing fair administration of the intoxilyzer test or to admission of the test results.

        Evidence that defendant, charged with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, had been involved in an accident and that a blood sample taken 11/2 hours after the accident showed a blood alcohol content of .12% was insufficient evidence to convict him where there was no testimony that the defendant had consumed any alcoholic beverage before the accident and where it was scientifically possible for the defendant to have obtained a blood-alcohol concentration of .12% during the period of 11/2 hours between the accident and the blood test.

       <p>
        Where the only evidence presented at trial which revealed that the defendant’s blood-alcohol content was above 0.10% was the blood-alcohol test results, which were defective for failure to seal and label the vial, substantial prejudice resulted from the admission of the blood-alcohol test results, therefore the error was not harmless and the conviction was reversed.

        Where the arresting officer testified that he detected the odor of alcohol on defendant’s breath, observed that his pupils were dilated and his speech slurred, and believed that defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the proof available to the state was not insufficient as a matter of law to convict. State v. Whitney, 377 N.W.2d 132, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 437</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support a guilty verdict on a charge of driving under the influence under this section without the administration of an Intoxilyzer test where the state provided evidence that defendant driver of motor vehicle on a public highway lacked clearness of intellect and control, testimony of passenger and bartender revealed defendant’s heavy consumption of alcohol, and officer detected an odor of alcohol, slurring of speech and impairment of coordination. State v. Pollack, 462 N.W.2d 119, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 208</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony of law enforcement officers who observed defendant in an intoxicated state combined with the testimony of a passing motorist who saw defendant driving erratically and staggering after the accident was sufficient to support defendant’s DUI conviction. State v. Roberson, 586 N.W.2d 687, 1998 ND App 15, 1998 N.D. App. LEXIS 15 (N.D. Ct. App. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state did not have to provide evidence of the defendant’s blood alcohol level when evidence of his slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, lack of balance, and odor of alcohol about him was sufficient for a jury finding that defendant was driving a car under the influence of an intoxicating liquor in violation of this section. State v. Knowels, 2003 ND 180, 671 N.W.2d 816, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for driving under the influence of drugs was supported by the evidence because, applying the definition of “drug” in N.D.C.C. § 19-03.1-01(13)(b)(c), the statutory language regulating driving under the influence of drugs included over-the-counter medications should they impair an individual’s ability to drive safely.

       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol because a district court was not obligated to believe testimony that a dirt bike was inoperable or that drinking occurred while the bike was being pushed. It was not necessary to decide if defendant was a “driver” based on his ability to direct the movement of the bike by steering and controlling the brakes because there was other evidence of defendant's driving prior to being located by an officer; the officer responded to a complaint about dirt bikes being driven in a recreational area, the officer heard the dirt bikes near the bottom of a dam area, and he saw headlights in the trees.

        In a trial for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the results of a breathalyzer test were not rendered inadmissible by the administering officer’s use of a discontinued operational checklist, where the checklist was currently approved by the state toxicologist at the time of the arrest, and was not substantively different from the form which replaced it. City of Williston v. Miller, 404 N.W.2d 50, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 300</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        Where the defendant failed to offer any rebutting evidence to refute the prima facie showing that his breath test was fair and accurate, the trial court did not err in admitting the certified copies of his breath alcohol test results.

       <p>
        In a trial for driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of at least .10%, the admission into evidence of an on-site chemical screening test was harmless error, where in light of two blood-alcohol tests presented to the jury, the prejudicial effect of the screening test was negligible. State v. Schimmel, 409 N.W.2d 335, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that the state could not prove that the defendant drove a vehicle within two hours of the Intoxilyzer test, results of the Intoxilyzer test would nevertheless be admissible in a case involving a charge of driving under the influence.

        In prosecution for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, evidence regarding the fact that a chemical test for intoxication was refused to be taken by the defendant was not sufficient, standing alone and by itself, to establish the guilt of the defendant, but was a fact which, if proven, could be considered in the light of all other proven facts in deciding the question of guilt or innocence.

        Although an actual violation is not required for an officer to have reasonable and articulable suspicion to make an investigative stop, the trial court in its analysis required proof of a violation of the exhibition driving statute, and therefore did not apply the appropriate legal standard, in granting motion to suppress evidence supporting charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol. State v. Ova, 539 N.W.2d 857, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The evidence did not support the finding of a stop before the sheriff smelled the odor of alcohol and thus there was no seizure implicating Fourth Amendment protections; therefore, the district court wrongly suppressed the evidence, dismissing the actual physical control charge. State v. Glaesman, 545 N.W.2d 178, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Where officer testified that he observed defendant’s pickup twice cross the fog line, the court could have reasonably concluded that officer was a credible witness, and that even though he incorrectly estimated the speed of defendant’s pickup or the initial distance between the two vehicles, the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion for stopping defendant’s vehicle. State v. Burris, 545 N.W.2d 192, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Traffic violation by itself constituted a sufficient reason for officer to stop vehicle driven by defendant, who had exceeded the speed limit by traveling at 40 miles per hour in a 30 miles per hour zone. State v. Storbakken, 552 N.W.2d 78, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        An initial consensual encounter that does not constitute a seizure may justifiably escalate into a stop if an officer acquires a reasonable suspicion or probable cause. State v. Gahner, 554 N.W.2d 818, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 239</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a driving under the influence case, a motion to suppress evidence was properly denied since there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment or N.D. Const. art. I, § 8, where an officer had the requisite grounds to make a valid investigative stop of a vehicle because defendant had violated N.D.C.C. § 39-10-38(1) by failing to signal a turn.
   State v. Fasteen, 2007 ND 162, 740 N.W.2d 60, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 2007).

        Where an officer conducting a traffic stop reasonably suspected that defendant was driving while intoxicated, where the officer asked defendant to submit to field sobriety tests and defendant agreed, but where the officer transported defendant to the police station to perform the sobriety tests because it was cold outside, the transportation of defendant constituted a seizure and was a de facto arrest. Because the officer’s reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing was insufficient to support a valid arrest and because the officer lacked probable cause, the de facto arrest violated defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights, and the trial court properly granted defendant’s motion to suppress evidence.

       <p>
        In a trial under this section, the language of N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07(5) was improperly included in instructions to the jury because it has only to do with the judge’s preliminary function of admitting evidence; it has nothing to do with the jury’s function of weighing the evidence. By telling the jury that the test results were received in evidence when the test was fairly administered, this instruction shifted the burden of disputing the test results to the defendant and violated his right to due process. State v. Vogel, 467 N.W.2d 86, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in the jury instructions told the jury that it could weigh the reliability of the intoxilyzer testing method and the test result in determining defendant’s intoxication. The instruction given substantially impaired the truth-finding function of the jury by shifting the burden to defendant to disprove fair administration of the test. This impairment was not cured by other instructions. Therefore, the instruction was prejudicial, not harmless. State v. Vogel, 467 N.W.2d 86, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        The general instructions given by the trial court were adequate to explain the driving under the influence law, though no single instruction given by the trial court explained that a chemical test cannot be used as evidence to convict the defendant of driving with a blood alcohol content of at least .10 if it was given more than two hours after he last drove. State v. Steinmetz, 552 N.W.2d 358, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Where the verdict forms should have been amended to allow a conviction of either driving under the influence or actual physical control or an acquittal of both, and where the court failed to provide the correct verdict forms and correct instructions on deliberating when a lesser included offense is a possibility, the instruction affected the substantial rights of defendant and was not harmless error. State v. Huber, 555 N.W.2d 791, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Where evidence was sufficient to show defendant was in actual physical control of vehicle, trial court was not required to instruct jury that intoxicated person’s presence in vehicle as a passenger did not constitute an offense.

        During appellant’s trial for being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, in violation of N.D.C.C. § 39-08-01(1), the jury instruction on actual physical control was not confusing where it properly informed the jury that one question of fact for them to decide was whether appellant’s vehicle was operable.

        District court did not err in failing to give defendant's requested jury instructions because they were incomplete statements of the law where the first proposed jury instruction did not include a qualification that the limited right to consult with an attorney might not interfere with alcohol testing, and the second proposed jury instruction inaccurately asked the jury to find affirmative refusal in the form of communication between the driver and the law enforcement officer.

        Silent record was insufficient to overcome the presumption that defendant’s prior uncounseled DUI conviction was void for enhancement purposes, and the state, in seeking to imprison defendant as a second offender based on his earlier presumptively void uncounseled conviction, had the burden of overcoming this presumption, once defendant raised the issue in a pretrial proceeding by resisting the motion to amend, by showing by parol or other evidence that defendant waived his right to counsel.

        Officer has probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence of drugs if the officer observes some signs of physical or mental impairment, and has reason to believe that impairment is caused by drugs; therefore, a driver’s license was properly revoked where the evidence showed that the driver operated a vehicle at an excess speed, had red and squinty eyes, failed several field sobriety tests, and the officer detected the odor of marijuana coming from the driver’s vehicle.

       <p>
        Probable cause supported the warrantless arrest of the defendant under this section; the defendant had lost consciousness at a restaurant drive-up window behind the wheel of his running motor vehicle, walked unsteadily, failed field sobriety tests, and also had trouble answering the officer’s questions.

        Officer had probable cause to believe defendant was driving under the influence of drugs, as (1) defendant’s van was weaving in his lane and was crossing over the yellow line separating the driving lane and turning lane, (2) defendant was belligerent, physically aggressive, and repeatedly used profanity toward officers, (3) throughout a traffic stop defendant was shaking, pacing back and forth, and could not keep still, (4) defendant failed a light reactivity test, and (5) the officer did not notice an odor of alcohol emanating from defendant; thus, the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress evidence found during a search incident to defendant’s arrest.

        In a case involving a license suspension based on a driving under the influence (DUI) case, there was no violation of a licensee’s rights under the Fourth Amendment or N.D. Const. Art. I, § 8; regardless of whether an officer’s initial encounter with the licensee in his front yard constituted a seizure, the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the licensee to investigate a citizen’s complaint regarding erratic driving based partially on the specific description of the car and the fact that the citizen followed the car and waited until police arrived. Further, the officer had probable cause to arrest the licensee for DUI where the licensee failed sobriety tests, had bloodshot and glassy eyes, and admitted to drinking.

        When defendant was arrested for driving under the influence, he told the arresting officer that he was not refusing to submit to a blood draw but wanted his attorney present; after he was unable to contact his attorney, a nurse proceeded with the blood test. Defendant’s quiet statement that he did not agree to the blood draw, coupled with his silence when given an opportunity to clarify, failed to effectively withdraw his consent for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 39-20-04; when the district court denied his motion to suppress the blood test results, defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty to a charge of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs and/or with an alcohol concentration of eight one-hundredths of one percent or greater by weight, in violation of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-08s39-08-01" target="_self">39-08-01</a></cite>.

        The operating procedure on the back side of an Alco-Sensor device is merely an additional approved method that warrants consideration of Alco-Sensor test results. Thus, the operating procedure on the back side of the Alco-Sensor device was irrelevant in a case in which law enforcement officer’s testimony showed that in administering Alco-Sensor test, he followed the approved method prescribed by the state toxicologist. Nichols v. Backes, 461 N.W.2d 113, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Where officer’s testimony established that he performed Alco-Sensor test according to the method approved by the state toxicologist, the hearing officer did not err in considering the results of the Alco-Sensor test in determining whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant had been driving a vehicle in violation of this section.

        Since the state toxicologist directs the use of “aqueous solutions of…providone iodine” or any “nonalcoholic, nonvolatile skin disinfectant,” where technician who took blood test candidly acknowledged that she did not know if the providone iodine swab she used contained an aqueous solution of that chemical or if it contained alcohol, the defendant’s conviction would be reversed.

        This section requires a chemical test to be given within two hours of driving if the test is to be used to establish the “per se” offense of driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10% or more.

        Admissibility of chemical test results is governed by N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07, which does not condition admissibility of a chemical test result upon the test’s performance within two hours of an arrested person’s driving of a motor vehicle as prescribed in this section.

         “Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor”.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The expression “under the influence of intoxicating liquor” simply means having drunk enough to disturb the action of the physical or mental faculties so that they are no longer in their natural or normal condition; it is not the amount involved, but the effect, that determines whether the person is under the influence. State v. Hanson, 73 N.W.2d 135, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The expression “under the influence of intoxicating liquor” covers not only the well-known and easily recognized conditions of intoxication but also covers any abnormal mental or physical condition which is the result of indulging, to any extent, in the use of intoxicating liquor, which use tends to deprive the user of that clearness of intellect and control of himself which he would otherwise possess. State v. Glavkee, 138 N.W.2d 663, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person may be “under the influence of intoxicating liquor” within the meaning of this section, even though he is not intoxicated. State v. Glavkee, 138 N.W.2d 663, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a person is so affected by intoxicating liquor as not to possess that clearness of intellect and control of himself that he would otherwise have, he is “under the influence of intoxicating liquor”. State v. Salhus, 220 N.W.2d 852, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person is “under the influence of intoxicating liquor” if that individual has imbibed any liquid containing alcohol which intoxicates or impairs his ability to function adequately while operating a vehicle. Thornton v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 399 N.W.2d 861, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In subdivision (1)(a), the legislature defined one variation of the crime of actual physical control while under the influence, but this is not the exclusive definition of DUI; subdivision (1)(b) makes it a crime to drive or be in actual physical control of any vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and a defendant may be convicted of DUI if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was driving a vehicle upon a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor so as not to possess the clearness of intellect and control of himself that he would otherwise have. State v. Miller, 530 N.W.2d 652, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Canadian statute defined an equivalent offense, as the levels of impairment required under each were equivalent, the statutes proscribed essentially the same conduct, driving a vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicating substance, and the differences in potential penalties was not so great as to indicate that the statutes proscribed a qualitatively different offense. Christianson v. Dir., Dep't of Transp., 2020 ND 245, 951 N.W.2d 231, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support the district court's decision that exigent circumstances permitted the warrantless blood-alcohol test because the circumstances included evidence about the limited staffing at law enforcement agencies on the evening of the Thanksgiving holiday, the investigation of a fatal accident rather than a “routine” drunk driving stop, and the natural dissipation of alcohol in defendant's blood system within the relevant timeframe.

       <p>
        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident involving injury and aggravated reckless driving, defendant’s sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing as the district court substantially relied upon an impermissible factor in sentencing defendant to jail because the case did not implicate an offense involving domestic violence, sexual offender registration, or mandatory terms of incarceration; defendant was not charged with, nor did he plead guilty to, any offense involving a dangerous weapon; and the dangerous weapon exception to the presumptive probation statute did not apply in defendant’s case.

        Evidence that defendant was driving east in the westbound lane of travel at the time of the collision with the other vehicle, was swerving back and forth on the roadway while driving in front of the other vehicle, and swerved so as to force the other vehicle off the road when it attempted to pass him was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for reckless driving. State v. Hartleib, 335 N.W.2d 795, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 316</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict driver of tractor/trailer of aggravated reckless driving for colliding with partially disabled vehicle where testimony at trial revealed that the driver of the disabled vehicle was more than halfway onto the shoulder of the road, and an investigation revealed that the tractor/trailer left no skid marks, tending to show the driver took no evasive actions; in addition, the state offered the testimony of an accident reconstruction specialist who concluded that from the time the tractor/trailer crested the hill where he could see the vehicle, until the point of impact, took approximately 51 seconds. State v. Syring, 524 N.W.2d 97, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>
        Evidence defendant was the only occupant of the vehicle, skid marks on the road started before the stop sign and went across the road where the car went into a slough, that the vehicle came to rest approximately 150 yards from the road. a fence was demolished, speed was a factor in the crash, and defendant acknowledged that he drank approximately 10 to 12 beer was sufficient to convict defendant of reckless driving. State v. Vanberkom, 2018 ND 167, 913 N.W.2d 764, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        Sufficient evidence supported a juvenile’s reckless driving conviction because the evidence showed the juvenile (1) ran three stop signs, (2) refused to stop after an officer turned on the officer’s overhead lights, and (3) drove at approximately 65 miles per hour in a residential area. K.V. v. A.V., 2019 ND 255, 934 N.W.2d 879, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        District court did not commit a procedural error in its calculation of defendant’s United State’s Sentencing Guidelines range because neither defendant’s 2003 nor 2006 conviction for “reckless driving” under N.D.C.C. § 39-08-03 was countable under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4A1.2(c)(1) as they both resulted in a sentence below the threshold required by § 4A1.2(b)(2), and they were not similar to a countable offense.

        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident involving injury and aggravated reckless driving, defendant’s sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing as the district court substantially relied upon an impermissible factor in sentencing defendant to jail because the case did not implicate an offense involving domestic violence, sexual offender registration, or mandatory terms of incarceration; defendant was not charged with, nor did he plead guilty to, any offense involving a dangerous weapon; and the dangerous weapon exception to the presumptive probation statute did not apply in defendant’s case.

       <p>
        In a case involving leaving the scene of an accident involving death under N.D.C.C. § 39-08-04, a motion for an acquittal under N.D.R.Crim.P. 29 was properly denied because an argument that defendant was not aware he had hit someone did not apply the negligence culpability standard under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-02-02; based on the age of a truck and problems that it was having, defendant should have at least gotten out and checked after he felt a bump while backing out of a parking lot near a bar. A witnesses’
   testimony regarding the amount of time defendant spent around his truck made the jury’s conclusion that defendant acted negligently by leaving the scene even more reasonable because it seemed more likely he would have known a drunk man was in the vicinity and could have been the source of the bump, even if he did not think the man was behind the truck when he backed up.

        Acquittals for murder and negligent homicide were not inconsistent with a conviction for leaving the scene of an accident causing death because the jury could have found that defendant did not negligently cause death, but negligently left the scene when he failed to get out and see what a bump was when he left the parking lot across from a bar.

       A person may not drink or consume alcoholic beverages, as defined in section 5-01-01, in or on any motor vehicle when the vehicle is upon a public highway or in an area used principally for public parking. A person may not have in that person’s possession on that person’s person while in or on a private motor vehicle upon a public highway or in an area used principally for public parking, any bottle or receptacle containing alcoholic beverages which has been opened, or the seal broken, or the contents of which have been partially removed. It is unlawful for the owner of any private motor vehicle or the driver, if the owner be not then present in or on the motor vehicle, to keep or allow to be kept in a motor vehicle when such vehicle is upon the public highway or in an area used principally for public parking any bottle or receptacle containing such alcoholic beverages which has been opened, or the seal broken, or the contents of which have been partially removed except when such bottle or receptacle is kept in the trunk of the motor vehicle when such vehicle is equipped with a trunk, or kept in some other area of the vehicle not normally occupied by the driver or passengers, if the motor vehicle is not equipped with a trunk. A utility compartment or glove compartment must be deemed to be within the area occupied by the driver and passengers. This subsection does not prohibit the consumption or possession of alcoholic beverages in a house car if the consumption or possession occurs in the area of the house car used as sleeping or living quarters and that area is separated from the driving compartment by a solid partition, door, curtain, or some similar means of separation; however, consumption is not authorized while the house car is in motion. Any person violating this subsection must be assessed a fee of fifty dollars; however, the licensing authority may not record the violation against the person’s driving record unless the person was the driver of the motor vehicle at the time that the violation occurred.

This subsection does not authorize possession or consumption of an alcoholic beverage by the operator of any motor vehicle described in this subsection while upon a public highway or in an area used principally for public parking.

        Where officer observed defendant in a park standing beside his vehicle with what appeared to be a beer bottle on top of the vehicle and then after defendant had left the parking lot, found the open beer bottle partially full and still cold and fresh, and officer pursued defendant for violation of open container law, the officer had reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify investigative stop, even though he did not witness defendant holding the bottle in or on the car, as his belief that the violation occurred was reasonably inferable from what he observed at the park. State v. Smith, 452 N.W.2d 86, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Following an investigatory stop, defendant’s continued seizure was not unreasonable where the deputy testified that upon approaching the vehicle he saw a rifle on the backseat and an open beer can, which was a violation of the open container law, N.D.C.C. § 39-08-18, the deputy noticed the odor of alcohol emanating from the vehicle, and defendant had bloodshot eyes and appeared to be nervous. Those observations were sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot and to justify expanding the scope of the stop.

        More and more the rule that one must drive at such a speed as to be able to stop within the assured clear distance ahead is being recognized as the imperative duty of the driver. Bagan v.

        Where court found that plaintiff had violated N.D.C.C. § 39-09-01, and had been driving his vehicle in a manner which would not enable him to stop within the “assured clear distance ahead”, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiff’s negligence was as great as the negligence of railroad, and court erred in granting summary judgment to railroad.

       The minimal facts in the record did not support a conclusion that officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was impeding traffic in violation of this section where there was no evidence of the length of a no-passing zone, nor if there were one, five, or ten cars coming up behind defendant, if defendant was truly impeding traffic in violation of the statute, or if defendant’s relatively slow speed only momentarily delayed some drivers from traveling at higher speeds while they traveled through a short no-passing zone.

       Trial court properly overturned an order suspending appellee’s driving privileges for 91 days for driving under the influence of alcohol where the fact that appellee was driving 8-10 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone at 12:43 a.m. did not provide the requisite reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify stopping his vehicle. There was no evidence that appellee was violating
   N.D.C.C. § 39-09-09(1) because the arresting officer was unaware of any other vehicles that were impeded by appellee’s slow speed.

        Motorist in control of a motor vehicle located in a private open field off the highway was properly subject to arrest for actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

       District court did not err in refusing to give defendant’s requested jury instruction under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14(1) because he failed to raise the requirements for the initial traffic stop in an appropriate pretrial motion and thus, waived the issue; the failure to charge defendant with refusing to submit to an onsite screening test was irrelevant to the validity of the stop, which turned on whether the officer had an articulable and reasonable suspicion he was violating the law for failure to stop.

        A law enforcement officer has the statutory authority to pursue a person who flees from an arrest but in conducting that pursuit, the officer and his employer will be held accountable, and be subject to liability, for damages incurred as a result of the pursuit, if the officer’s conduct constitutes gross negligence.

        N.D.C.C. §§ 39-09-06 and 39-10-03 authorize law enforcement personnel to exceed the posted speed limit to pursue a suspected violator, so long as it can be done without danger to life or property; therefore, in a driving under the influence case, defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by a trooper’s act of speeding to catch up and follow defendant’s car. Moreover, the trooper was not required to have a reasonable and articulable suspicion at the time the vehicle was initially pursued.

        Where officer observed defendant commit a moving violation, by crossing the center line, and her observation gave her a valid basis to stop defendant’s vehicle, the validity of the stop was not vitiated merely because the officer subjectively stopped the vehicle for another reason, i.e., another officer told her to, which, in itself, may not have provided an adequate basis for the stop. Zimmerman v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp. Dir, 543 N.W.2d 479, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Once police officer observed defendant crossing the center line, officer had probable cause to believe defendant violated this section, had sufficient grounds for conducting an investigatory stop, and thus, evidence obtained from that stop was correctly admitted.

        Where a trooper observed defendant commit traffic violations by crossing the center and fog lines of a two-lane highway, there was a reasonable and articulable suspicion for initiating a traffic stop in a driving under the influence case. Moreover, the trooper’s onboard camera captured video images of such, corroborating the trooper’s testimony.

        Purpose of sounding horn before passing, or attempting to pass another vehicle upon highway, is to alert other driver that one intends to pass. Muhlhauser v. Archie Campbell Constr. Co., 160 N.W.2d 524, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 1968).

        When a motorist contacted a dispatcher on a cell phone and complained of a driver who sped up and slowed down when the motorist attempted to pass, and the dispatcher relayed this information to an officer, the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle. Based on the record, it was not entirely clear the information the calling motorist conveyed amounted to a traffic violation where there was no information to suggest the motorist made an audible signal that he intended to pass.

        Trial court properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained from a traffic stop because the evidence presented at the suppression hearing was sufficient to support the conclusion that the arresting officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant had violated the practicable lane statute, N.D.C.C. § 39-10-17(1), by crossing over the fog line.

        In a drug case, a traffic stop was legal because of a sergeant’s observation of defendant crossing over the solid white line on the road, in violation of the practicable lane statute; whether the stop was pretextual was irrelevant because the validity of an investigatory stop turned on whether there was a reasonable suspicion that a law had been broken.

        Where plaintiff taxicab driver allegedly sustained injuries when his taxi which he had stopped for traffic signal was struck in rear by car of defendant on slippery street, trial court did not err in determining that, under the evidence and applicable North Dakota law, issue of liability of defendant was for the jury and in denying plaintiff’s motion for a directed verdict.

     <p>
      Whenever any highway has been divided into two or more roadways by leaving an intervening space or by a physical barrier or clearly indicated dividing section so constructed as to impede vehicular traffic, every vehicle must be driven only upon the right-hand roadway, unless directed or permitted to use another roadway by official traffic-control devices or police officers. No vehicle may be driven over, across, or within any such dividing space, barrier, or section, except through an opening in such physical barrier or dividing section or space or at a crossover or intersection as established by public authority, unless such crossing is specifically prohibited and such prohibition is indicated by appropriate traffic-control devices.

       <p>
        The possession of the right of way by the driver of a vehicle does not absolve him of the necessity of exercising due care, but he has a right to assume that the driver of the less favored vehicle will obey the law. Zettle v. Lutovsky, 72 N.D. 331, 7 N.W.2d 180, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where negligence must be proved in an automobile case, it is not sufficient to have right of way or to rely upon presumption that everyone will obey rules of the road since, even if driver has right of way, he may not fully disregard other cars on highway and has duty to avoid collision with another automobile even if such automobile is violating rules of road. Thompson v. Nettum, 163 N.W.2d 91, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action involving a collision at an uncontrolled intersection, where there was no evidence showing any negligence on the part of the plaintiff and no evidence of circumstances from which he should have concluded that the defendant did not intend to yield the right of way, it was not error for the trial court to refuse to instruct pertaining to the duty of a driver having the directional right of way.

        Where the evidence showed that the plaintiff, a nine-year-old bicycle rider, was struck by defendant’s automobile in the middle of an intersection, it indicated that the bicycle had been in the intersection an appreciable length of time ahead of the automobile and this section was inapplicable. Kleinjan v. Knutson, 207 N.W.2d 247, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 1973).

        In an action arising out of a collision of a truck and an automobile at an unobstructed intersection of two gravel, nonarterial roads, where the automobile was on the right of the truck and the vehicles reached the intersection at approximately the same time, evidence sustained a finding that the truck driver, irrespective of the other driver’s lookout, could have yielded the right of way and was negligent in failing to do so.

        The right of way given by an ordinance to a vehicle approaching an intersection from the right is not absolute, and gives precedence only against a vehicle approaching from the left which, with due regard to other rules of the road, will not pass the intersection first. Pederson v. O'Rourke, 54 N.D. 428, 209 N.W. 798, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 1926).

        The driver of a favored vehicle may not continue to rely on the assumption that he will be given the right of way after circumstances develop from which a reasonable person would conclude that the driver of the approaching vehicle did not intend to yield the right of way. Zettle v. Lutovsky, 72 N.D. 331, 7 N.W.2d 180, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1942).

        Where defendant drove his auto at an excessive rate of speed, and his windshield was covered with frost except for a small area immediately in front of the defendant, and the record shows defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of careless driving from the accident in question, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of negligence on the part of such defendant even though defendant approached the intersection from the right. Heid v. Shafer, 140 N.W.2d 584, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiff, as he was about to enter the intersection, observed the defendant’s auto some two hundred to three hundred feet from the intersection, such plaintiff had a right to assume the defendant was not approaching at an excessive rate of speed and that he, the plaintiff, had plenty of time to cross the intersection, and he was not negligent in making such assumptions. Heid v. Shafer, 140 N.W.2d 584, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1966).

       One who drove at an unlawful rate of speed thereby forfeited the right of way he might otherwise have had, but the loss of his right of way did not mean that the driver became a trespasser on the highway, nor did it mean that the right of way so lost was conferred upon the driver of another car.

       District court did not err in refusing to give defendant’s requested jury instruction under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14(1) because he failed to raise the requirements for the initial traffic stop in an appropriate pretrial motion and thus, waived the issue; the failure to charge defendant with refusing to submit to an onsite screening test was irrelevant to the validity of the stop, which turned on whether the officer had an articulable and reasonable suspicion he was violating the law for failure to stop.

        Where question whether pedestrian struck by defendant’s automobile had crossed street at crosswalk or had jaywalked while returning from church was critical issue and where there were no witnesses to occurrence other than parties whose testimony was in conflict, evidence that pedestrian had been in habit of crossing street, in returning from church, at point east of crosswalk should have been admitted for consideration by jury as tending to corroborate evidence of motorist, and its exclusion from evidence was prejudicial error; where evidence of habit is offered on issue of negligence, it must be limited to conduct which constitutes person’s regular practice of meeting particular situation with specific conduct, thus showing that doing such act and conduct of person in meeting certain situation was practically automatic; it must not be too remote in time or place from the events under investigation.

       <p>
        Where question whether pedestrian struck by defendant’s automobile had crossed street at crosswalk or had jaywalked while returning from church was critical issue and where there were no witnesses to occurrence other than parties whose testimony was in conflict, evidence that pedestrian had been in habit of crossing street, in returning from church, at point east of crosswalk should have been admitted for consideration by jury as tending to corroborate evidence of motorist, and its exclusion from evidence was prejudicial error; where evidence of habit is offered on issue of negligence, it must be limited to conduct which constitutes person’s regular practice of meeting particular situation with specific conduct, thus showing that doing such act and conduct of person in meeting certain situation was practically automatic; it must not be too remote in time or place from the events under investigation.

        Officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant because, even if mistaken about turn signal usage, the officer could have reached an objectively reasonable conclusion that exiting a roundabout constituted a movement requiring a signal, thus providing the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify the stop.

        The trial court erroneously refused requested instruction on the duty of a driver to appropriately signal a sudden stop or decrease in speed. Although the trial court gave an instruction on brake lights which encompassed N.D.C.C. §§ 39-21-06(1) and 39-21-19(1), and, although the trial court instructed that ordinary care was required in operating a motor vehicle, it did not instruct on the duty to signal before a stop, as requested. While the violation of a statutory duty is not negligence per se, it is evidence of negligence. Gronneberg v. Hoffart, 466 N.W.2d 809, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>

        District court erred in suppressing evidence obtained from a traffic stop because defendant committed a traffic violation, giving a deputy reasonable suspicion to justify the traffic stop; the deputy observed defendant fail to signal when exiting an alley qualifying as a roadway, and the alley qualified as a roadway because it was a publicly maintained way improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, requiring defendant to signal prior to exiting the alley. State v. Hirschkorn, 2016 ND 117, 881 N.W.2d 244, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2016).

       <p>
        Defendant’s interpretation of N.D.C.C. § 39-10-38(1) to permit a vehicle to turn left or right on a roadway without giving an appropriate signal if the turn can be made safely without signaling was rejected as it would prohibit any right or left turn upon a roadway unless and until the turn could be made safely without giving an appropriate signal and therefore would lead to the absurd result of not authorizing any “signaled” turns;
   N.D.C.C. § 39-10-38(1) is construed to mean that no person may turn a vehicle or move right or left upon a roadway without giving an appropriate signal and unless and until such turn or movement can be made with reasonable safety. State v. Fasteen, 2007 ND 162, 740 N.W.2d 60, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading N.D.C.C. §§ 39-01-01(73) and 39-10-38(1) and the definition of highway at § 39-01-01(29) together, no person may turn a vehicle or move right or left upon that portion of a publicly maintained way improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel without giving an appropriate signal; section 39-10-38(1) requires drivers to signal prior to exiting alleys when such alleys qualify as roadways under § 39-01-01(73). State v. Hirschkorn, 2016 ND 117, 881 N.W.2d 244, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under a concerted, harmonious interpretation, N.D.C.C. § 39-10-45 supplements rather than supplants N.D.C.C. § 39-10-38(1); Read together, §§ 39-10-38(1) and 39-10-45 require drivers to stop at specific distances before exiting alleys in addition to, but not exclusive of, requiring drivers on roadways to signal when appropriate. State v. Hirschkorn, 2016 ND 117, 881 N.W.2d 244, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature's failure to exempt drivers from the requirement to signal while exiting alleys when it specifically exempted drivers exiting alleys from other requirements is an indication of its intent not to do so with the signaling requirement. State v. Hirschkorn, 2016 ND 117, 881 N.W.2d 244, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        The law recognizes the right of a driver to stop on a highway in an emergency, so a burning taillight on an automobile on a highway does not necessarily indicate a moving vehicle and, when such a signal comes into view, it is reasonable to expect a driver approaching from the rear to ascertain whether the car is moving or standing before driving into the zone of danger.

        Where evidence showed that driver of wrecker was negligent in failing to drive farther off the traveled portion of the highway before attempting to back up and turn around and that he was also negligent in failing to ascertain that the backward movement could be made with reasonable safety and without interfering with other traffic, the jury was justified in determining that the negligence of the defendants was a proximate cause of the death of plaintiff’s husband.

        Even if the City of Williston, North Dakota, had adopted N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-11 verbatim as its city ordinance or the State had stipulated to the substitution, double jeopardy did not attach, because the statute to which defendant had already pled guilty was criminalized flight by anything other than a motor vehicle, including on foot, under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-11, and N.D.C.C. § 39-10-71, governed flight by motor vehicle. Thus, a comparison of the two offenses revealed that they were two distinctly different crimes; therefore, double jeopardy could not attach and defendant’s conviction under N.D.C.C. § 39-10-71(1) was affirmed. State v. Stensaker, 2007 ND 6, 725 N.W.2d 883, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 2007).

        Evidence at the trial level relating to whether police officer’s signal to stop was perceptible to defendant was sufficient to justify the court’s guilty verdict. State v. Eversvik, 514 N.W.2d 370, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly convicted of simple assault on a peace officer, fleeing or attempting to elude a peace officer, and preventing arrest because he was given a visual signal to stop when a detective activated his emergency lights and, while the emergency lights were still on and without any indication the detective had released him, defendant drove away and when the detective another officer later encountered defendant at a storage unit, defendant shoved the detective into a storage unit door, closed his car door on the detective’s arm, and kicked the other officer in the chest and chin, causing both officers pain. State v. Hamre, 2019 ND 86, 924 N.W.2d 776, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported a juvenile’s fleeing or attempting to elude a peace officer conviction because the evidence showed the juvenile drove a vehicle which picked up speed after an officer attempted to stop the vehicle by turning on the officer’s squad car’s overhead lights. K.V. v. A.V., 2019 ND 255, 934 N.W.2d 879, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        This section, prohibiting fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, applies to the driver of a motor vehicle fleeing from a peace officer on foot, as the legislature added the phrase “in any manner” to…“who otherwise flees or attempts to elude.” State v. Pollack, 462 N.W.2d 119, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 208</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where officer initially used flashing lights on her police car to signal defendant to stop vehicle and when officer told defendant to get into police car, defendant told officer “I don’t have to take this shit” and then broke loose from officer’s grasp and ran away, there was sufficient evidence to find that defendant violated this section by fleeing on foot.

        Police officer had probable cause that defendant was fleeing or attempting to elude him under N.D.C.C. § 39-10-71, which is not a minor, nonjailable offense, and the officer’s warrantless, limited entry into defendant’s open garage while in hot pursuit of defendant was reasonable. The district court erred in granting defendant’s motion to suppress evidence for a violation of her rights under either the Fourth Amendment or N.D. Const. art. I, § 8. City of Bismarck v.

       <p>
        A proceeding by the highway commissioner under N.D.C.C. §§ 39-12-11 to 39-12-22 to recover charges for extraordinary use of highways, following impoundment of a vehicle carrying excess weight, is a proceeding in rem, which is purely statutory, and the statutory procedures must be followed by impounding officers and the court. Wentz v. One White Tractor, 110 N.W.2d 178, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1961).

         Process.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The impounding of a vehicle carrying excess weight under N.D.C.C. §§ 39-12-11 to 39-12-22 is the equivalent of process and gives the court jurisdiction of the res upon the filing of a complaint as provided in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-12s39-12-14" target="_self">39-12-14</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        The equivalent of process giving court jurisdiction over a vehicle is satisfied by holding that vehicle in legal custody. State ex rel. Hjelle v. 1973 Brockway Tractor, 299 N.W.2d 557, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 298</cite> (N.D. 1980).

         Release of Vehicle.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When a cash bond is furnished, the vehicle is released from impoundment but the jurisdiction of the court continues over both the cash and the vehicle (N.D.C.C. § 39-12-18) even though the vehicle has been released. Wentz v. One White Tractor, 110 N.W.2d 178, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        A vehicle carrying excess weight must remain impounded until a cash bond is furnished. Wentz v. One White Tractor, 110 N.W.2d 178, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vehicle must be held until trial to preserve the court’s jurisdiction over it, unless a cash bond is furnished, in which case the vehicle is released and the court’s jurisdiction continues over both the cash and the vehicle; cash deposit sufficiently satisfied the cash bond requirement and court’s jurisdiction continued over the vehicle and the cash after release of the impounded vehicle where the deposit was made as a condition for release.

     <p>
      Before the complaint is issued under section 39-12-14, the owner, or the owner’s driver or agent, may voluntarily pay the amount of the extraordinary road use fee, or may provide proof of surety coverage to ensure payment of the extraordinary road use fee, provided under section 39-12-17, plus any towing or storage costs. Any settlement, whether made by the owner, or the owner’s driver or agent, is presumed to be voluntary. A peace officer or a peace officer’s designee is authorized to receive the settlement payment on behalf of the authority having jurisdiction over the road on which the violation occurred. The extraordinary road use fees for a violation on an interstate or on a state highway must be deposited with the state treasurer to be credited to the state highway fund. Extraordinary road use fees for a violation that did not occur on an interstate or a state highway must be deposited in the general fund of the jurisdiction having authority over the road on which the violation occurred and must be used for the support of the road system of that jurisdiction.

The balance of the proceeds of any sale after the payment of costs and charges is appropriated on a continuing basis out of the funds collected to be paid to the person entitled to the proceeds as determined by the court or must be deposited with the clerk of court for payment to that person.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Inclusion in motor vehicle policy of restrictive limitation on class of potential beneficiaries through “household, or family, exclusion clause” was void as violative of public policy and financial responsibility laws of North Dakota. Hughes v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 236 N.W.2d 870, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for a motor vehicle liability policy purchased to avoid the sanctions in N.D.C.C. § 39-16-05, it must provide the named insured, and any other person using the insured motor vehicle with permission of the named insured, with minimum coverage for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the insured motor vehicle. Therefore, a “household or family exclusion” clause violated the financial responsibility laws and public policy because that clause excluded coverage for a class of beneficiaries suffering damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the insured motor vehicle. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LaRoque, 486 N.W.2d 235, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>
        The financial responsibility laws of North Dakota do not evidence a clear public policy that a motor vehicle liability policy cover the named insured for every automobile that the insured might drive. Instead, North Dakota financial responsibility laws demonstrate a legislative intent to allow insurance companies to insure fewer than all vehicles driven by an insured. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LaRoque, 486 N.W.2d 235, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        The basic purpose of this chapter and N.D.C.C. ch. 39-16.1, is to protect innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents from financial disaster. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LaRoque, 486 N.W.2d 235, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The license suspension sanctions imposed by this chapter were intended to guarantee financial responsibility for a first accident, in contrast to the requirements of N.D.C.C. ch. 39-16.1, which were designed to establish proof of financial responsibility for future accidents involving a motor vehicle owner or operator who has already had an accident, or who has been convicted of certain traffic offenses. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LaRoque, 486 N.W.2d 235, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Where the insured’s son was injured while driving his father’s truck, he filed suit against the insurance company seeking a payment of benefits under the underinsured motorist (UIM) provisions of a commercial auto insurance policy; the insurance company claimed that there was no coverage based on the insured’s alleged material misrepresentations made to obtain the insurance policy, fraud, concealment, and collusion. The district court erred by granting summary judgment for the insurance company; there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether N.D.C.C. § 39-16.1-11(6)(a) prohibited cancellation of the policy, because the son was an injured innocent third party and UIM coverage was mandatory under the financial responsibility laws as set forth in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-16s39-16-05" target="_self">39-16-05</a></cite>.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Inclusion in motor vehicle policy of restrictive limitation on class of potential beneficiaries through “household, or family, exclusion clause” was void as violative of public policy and financial responsibility laws of North Dakota. Hughes v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 236 N.W.2d 870, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for a motor vehicle liability policy purchased to avoid the sanctions in N.D.C.C. § 39-16-05, it must provide the named insured, and any other person using the insured motor vehicle with permission of the named insured, with minimum coverage for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the insured motor vehicle. Therefore, a “household or family exclusion” clause violated the financial responsibility laws and public policy because that clause excluded coverage for a class of beneficiaries suffering damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the insured motor vehicle. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LaRoque, 486 N.W.2d 235, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>
        The basic purpose of this chapter and N.D.C.C. ch. 39-16 was to protect innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents from financial disaster. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LaRoque, 486 N.W.2d 235, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The license suspension sanctions imposed by N.D.C.C. ch. 39-16, were intended to guarantee financial responsibility for a first accident, in contrast to the requirements of this chapter which were designed to establish proof of financial responsibility for future accidents involving a motor vehicle owner or operator who has already had an accident, or who has been convicted of certain traffic offenses. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LaRoque, 486 N.W.2d 235, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the basic purpose of North Dakota’s financial responsibility laws is to protect innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents from financial ruin, the statutory scheme accomplishes that objective by requiring the owner to purchase insurance coverage for the operation of a designated vehicle. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. LaRoque, 486 N.W.2d 235, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1992).

Such certificate must give the effective date of such motor vehicle liability policy, which date shall be the same as the effective date of the certificate, and must designate by explicit description or by appropriate reference all motor vehicles covered thereby, unless the policy is an operator’s policy.

It is unlawful for such person to operate any motor vehicle not covered by such certificate. In the event a person desires to be relieved of the foregoing restriction and to be permitted to operate any motor vehicle, the person may have such restriction removed upon filing a certificate showing that there has been issued to the person a motor vehicle liability policy insuring the person against liability arising out of the use of any motor vehicle.

         Must designate by explicit description or by appropriate reference all motor vehicles with respect to which coverage is thereby to be granted; and
        </li>
        <li id="t39c39-16.1s39-16.1-11ol12b">
         Must insure the person named therein and any other person, as insured, using such motor vehicle or motor vehicles with the express or implied permission of such named insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of such motor vehicles within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interest and costs, with respect to each such motor vehicle, as follows: twenty-five thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and subject to said limit for one person, fifty thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and twenty-five thousand dollars because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident.

      <li id="t39c39-16.1s39-16.1-11ol14">
       Such motor vehicle liability policy must state the name and address of the named insured, the coverage afforded by the policy, the premium charged therefor, the policy period and the limits of liability, and must contain an agreement or be endorsed that insurance is provided thereunder in accordance with the coverage defined in this chapter as respects bodily injury and death or property damage, or both, and is subject to all the provisions of this chapter.

       Such motor vehicle liability policy need not insure any liability under any workforce safety and insurance law nor any liability on account of bodily injury to or death of an employee of the insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured, or while engaged in the operation, maintenance, or repair of any such motor vehicle nor any liability for damage to property owned by, rented to, in charge of, or transported by the insured.

         The liability of the insurance carrier with respect to the insurance required by this chapter becomes absolute if injury or damage covered by the motor vehicle liability policy occurs; the policy may not be canceled or annulled as to the liability by any agreement between the insurance carrier and the insured after the occurrence of the injury or damage; and a statement made by the insured or on the insured’s behalf and a violation of the policy do not defeat or void the policy. This subdivision does not restrict the ability of an insurance carrier to void a motor vehicle liability policy for which an application was made after injury or damage occurred and does not obligate the insurance carrier to pay a claim on account of injury or damage that occurred before the application was made.

         The insurance carrier has the right to settle any claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount of that settlement is deductible from the limits of liability specified in subdivision b of subsection 2 for the accident out of which the claim arose.

         The policy, the written application of the policy, if any, and any rider or endorsement that does not conflict with the provisions of this chapter constitute the entire contract between the parties.

With respect to a policy which grants such excess or additional coverage, the term “motor vehicle policy” applies only to that part of the coverage which is required by this section.

        District court did not err in granting an insurer's motion for summary judgment and denying summary judgment to the insured, the driver, and the injured motorcyclist because, while the insured was liable for the driver's negligent acts, the policy was an owner's policy, the driver's car was not designated on the policy, and the driver's car was not a newly acquired car.

        Where an insured’s wife drove the insured’s vehicle without his permission and collided with a semi-trailer and where the wife told an investigating officer that she intentionally collided with the semi-trailer in a suicide attempt, the insurance company was entitled to summary judgment in its declaratory action seeking a determination that it was not required to afford coverage for the incident and the trial court erred in denying the insurance company’s summary judgment motion because coverage was afforded for the named insured and permissive drivers and the wife was neither. Further, the policy expressly excluded coverage for intentionally caused bodily injury or property damage; because the wife admitted that the collision was intentional and not accidental, no coverage was afforded under the policy terms.

        By requiring a designation of all covered vehicles, subsection (2) of this section contemplates the circumstance that there will be vehicles not designated and therefore not covered. An “operator’s policy” requires insurance for the named insured for damages arising out of the use of any motor vehicle, either unlimited, or limited by excluding certain classes or types of motor vehicles and may furnish limited coverage by excluding certain classes or types of vehicles.

        Where the insured’s son was injured while driving his father’s truck, he filed suit against the insurance company seeking a payment of benefits under the underinsured motorist (UIM) provisions of a commercial auto insurance policy; the insurance company claimed that there was no coverage based on the insured’s alleged material misrepresentations made to obtain the insurance policy, fraud, concealment, and collusion. The district court erred by granting summary judgment for the insurance company; there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether N.D.C.C. § 39-16.1-11(6)(a) prohibited cancellation of the policy, because the son was an injured innocent third party and UIM coverage was required by state law.

       Proof of financial responsibility may be evidenced by the bond of a surety company duly authorized to transact business within this state, or a bond with at least two individual sureties each owning real estate not exempt from execution of a value twice the amount of such bond, which real estate must be scheduled in the bond approved by a judge of a court of record, and recorded in the office of the recorder of each county in which such real estate is situated, which said bond must be conditioned for payment of the amounts specified in section 39-16.1-02. Such bond must be filed with the director and is not cancelable except after ten days’ written notice to the director. Such bond constitutes a lien in favor of the state upon the real estate so scheduled of any surety, which lien exists for the benefit of any holder of a final judgment against the person who has filed such bond, for damages, including damages for care and loss of services, because of bodily injury to or death of any person, or for damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, resulting from the ownership, maintenance, use, or operation of a motor vehicle after such bond is recorded.

      Before the issuance of a mobile home or manufactured home dealer’s license, the applicant for the license shall furnish a continuous surety bond executed by the applicant as principal and executed by a surety company licensed and qualified to do business within this state. The bond must be in the amount of fifty thousand dollars, and be conditioned upon the faithful compliance by the applicant as a dealer, if the license is issued to the dealer, that the dealer will comply with all the laws of this state pertaining to the business, and regulating or being applicable to the business of the dealer as a dealer in mobile homes or manufactured homes, and indemnifying any person dealing or transacting business with the dealer in connection with any mobile home or manufactured home from any loss or damage occasioned by the failure of the dealer to comply with the provisions of the laws of this state. This includes the furnishing of a proper and valid certificate of title to the vendee of a mobile home within fifteen days of the sale of a mobile home, and to the vendee of a travel trailer as defined by section 57-55-01 within fifteen days of the sale of a travel trailer. In addition, this includes furnishing to the vendee of a manufactured home within fifteen days of the sale of a manufactured home an affidavit of affixation that is obtained from the county recorder in the county where the real property is affixed, a letter of confirmation, and a bill of sale that includes a statement as to whether there are any liens or encumbrances on the manufactured home. The bond must be filed with the director before the issuance of the license provided for under this chapter. The aggregate liability of the surety to all persons for all losses or damages may not exceed the amount of the bond. Any third party sustaining injury within the terms of the bond may proceed against the principal and surety without making the state a party to any proceeding. The bond may be canceled by the surety, as to future liability, by giving written notice by certified mail, addressed to the principal at the address stated in the bond, and to the department. Thirty days after the mailing of the notice, the bond is null and void as to any liability thereafter arising. The surety remains liable, subject to the terms, conditions, and provisions of the bond, until the effective date of the cancellation.

     <p>
      The owner of a travel trailer, housetrailer, or mobile home, who sells or transfers the title to such vehicle shall endorse an assignment and warranty of title upon the certificate of title for such vehicle, along with a statement as to whether there are liens or encumbrances thereon. The owner shall deliver the certificate of title to the purchaser within fifteen days after such sale if title passes to the purchaser. If the legal title does not pass to the purchaser under the contract for sale of the vehicle, the legal title owner shall endorse thereon a statement that the owner holds the lien, the date thereof, and the name of the purchaser, and shall send the certificate of title to the department with an application of the purchaser for a new certificate of title showing the name of the legal owner, the registered owner, the date of the lien of the legal owner, which certificate of title when issued must be returned by the department to the legal title owner; who shall retain the same in the owner’s possession until the terms of the contract are complied with by the purchaser, and thereupon, after showing that the lien has been paid and satisfied the owner shall deliver the certificate of title properly assigned to the purchaser. The purchaser or transferee shall present the endorsed and assigned certificate to the department, within thirty days after the receipt thereof, accompanied by a transfer fee of five dollars, and shall make an application for and obtain a new certificate of title for such vehicle. A penalty of not more than ten dollars may be imposed by the director for failure to present the certificate of title to the department as required by this section. Except when transported by a drive-away transporter duly registered and licensed under the laws of this state, no person may haul a mobile home, housetrailer, or travel trailer unless the same is first registered with and titled by the department, a certificate of title has been issued, and it displays a number plate issued by and under such regulations as the director may prescribe. The annual fee for such licensing is twenty dollars for mobile homes and housetrailers and twenty dollars for travel trailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The registration required hereunder must be on a calendar-year basis.
     </p>
     <p>
      If such mobile home, housetrailer, or travel trailer enters the state carrying the current number plate of another state, no number plates may be required by the state of North Dakota for a period of thirty days.
     </p>
     <p>
      The annual license fee provided for in this section does not preclude the taxation of certain mobile homes pursuant to chapter 57-55.
     </p>
     <p>
      If such mobile home, housetrailer, or travel trailer remains stationary or parked within the state of North Dakota for a period of one year, no license may be required for that year, provided that nothing in this chapter permits the use of a dealer’s plate on such mobile home, housetrailer, or travel trailer after the same has been sold by the dealer to whom such plate was issued.

       Any individual who operates a motor vehicle on a highway or on public or private areas to which the public has a right of access for vehicular use in this state is deemed to have given consent, and shall consent, subject to the provisions of this chapter, to a chemical test, or tests, of the blood, breath, oral fluid, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, oral fluid, or urine. As used in this chapter, the word “drug” means any drug or substance or combination of drugs or substances which renders an individual incapable of safely driving, and the words “chemical test” or “chemical analysis” mean any test to determine the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, or urine, approved by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee under this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-01ol12">
       The test or tests must be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer only after placing the individual under arrest for violation of section 39-08-01 or an equivalent offense. For the purposes of this chapter, the taking into custody of a child under section 27-20.4-05 or an individual under twenty-one years of age satisfies the requirement of an arrest. The law enforcement officer shall determine which of the tests is to be used.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-01ol13">
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-01ol13a">
         The law enforcement officer shall inform the individual North Dakota law requires the individual to take a chemical test to determine whether the individual is under the influence of alcohol or drugs and refusal of the individual to submit to a test directed by the law enforcement officer may result in a revocation of the individual’s driving privileges for a minimum of one hundred eighty days and up to three years.
        </li>
        <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-01ol13b">
         If an individual refuses to submit to testing under this section, proof of the refusal is not admissible in any administrative proceeding under this chapter if the law enforcement officer fails to inform the individual as required under subdivision a.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-01ol14">
       When an individual under the age of eighteen years is taken into custody for violating section 39-08-01 or an equivalent ordinance, the law enforcement officer shall attempt to contact the individual’s parent or legal guardian to explain the cause for the custody. Neither the law enforcement officer’s efforts to contact, nor any consultation with, a parent or legal guardian may be permitted to interfere with the administration of chemical testing requirements under this chapter. The law enforcement officer shall mail a notice to the parent or legal guardian of the minor within ten days after the test results are received or within ten days after the minor is taken into custody if the minor refuses to submit to testing. The notice must contain a statement of the test performed and the results of that test; or if the minor refuses to submit to the testing, a statement notifying of that fact. The attempt to contact or the contacting or notification of a parent or legal guardian is not a precondition to the admissibility of chemical test results or the finding of a consent to, or refusal of, chemical testing by the individual in custody.

        Because the constitutionality of implied consent laws as an unconstitutional condition had not been briefed or argued by either party in any meaningful way, the supreme court did not address the issue. McCoy v. North Dakota DOT, 2014 ND 119, 848 N.W.2d 659, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        North Dakota's implied consent law as challenged, either on its face or as applied, does not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution applying either general Fourth Amendment principles or under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. Beylund v. Levi, 2015 ND 18, 859 N.W.2d 403, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 19</cite> (N.D. 2015), vacated, 579 U.S. 438, 136 S. Ct. 2160, 195 L. Ed. 2d 560, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 4058 (U.S. 2016).

        In a case involving the suspension of an operator's driving privileges, the implied consent law did not violate the unconstitutional conditions doctrine; the argument had already been considered and rejected in Beylund v. Levi, 2015 ND 18, 859 N.W.2d 403.Rounkles v. Levi, 2015 ND 128, 863 N.W.2d 910, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2015), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 136 S. Ct. 2539, 195 L.

        Because a driver pointed to no authority for his interpretation of the implied-consent law, the supreme court did not consider adequately briefed the issue that his license revocation violated the constitution and did not address the issue; unless the driver could show the North Dakota Constitution's search and seizure provision provided more protection than the Fourth Amendment of the federal constitution, his argument failed.

        The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to suppress the results of intoxilyzer test, where the first test record was defective and the test was aborted before defendant could provide breath samples, after the second test record was inserted defendant gave breath samples which were properly recorded, and both the defective and completed test records were retained and submitted.

        Trial court erred in overturning the revocation of petitioner’s driver’s license where the blood-alcohol test results were properly admitted in evidence; because petitioner consented to the blood-alcohol test, petitioner was not harmed by a deputy’s failure to repeat the implied consent advisory.

        Where a police officer read the implied consent advisory to defendant, where defendant was arrested after failing field sobriety tests and a preliminary breath test, and where defendant was then transferred to a hospital for a blood test to determine his blood-alcohol concentration level, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to suppress the results of the blood test and in rejecting defendant’s argument that the police officer was required to give him the mandatory implied consent advisory a second time before he submitted to the blood test. The evidence was admissible because the police officer complied with the procedures for implied consent under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01, defendant’s consent was implied under the statute, and defendant did not affirmatively withdraw his consent to a blood test.

        Administrative hearing officer properly concluded that appellant was tested according to N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01 where an officer read appellant the implied consent advisories, requested appellant to submit to an onsite alcohol screening test, appellant agreed to take the test, and that agreement was not coerced given his testimony that he took the test to avoid criminal punishment.

        In a case in which a motorist appealed from a district court judgment affirming a decision suspending his driving privileges for two years, the Supreme Court concluded the implied consent advisory was incomplete and thus inadmissible under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3)(b). Because the motorist did not challenge the constitutionality of the statutes as applied to him, and because the State was not permitted to omit part of the statutory advisory to avoid a potential as-applied challenge, the admissibility statute was applied as written. Schoon v. N.D. DOT, 2018 ND 210, 917 N.W.2d 199, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        Admissibility requirement in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3)(b) was not conditioned on an accurate advisory or a driver’s obtaining an understanding of the consequences of the choices available. Section 39-20-01(3)(b) simply conditions admissibility on whether the officer informed the driver of the contents of § 39-20-01(3)(a). Schoon v. N.D.

        Because an officer’s implied consent advisory did not substantively comply with the requirement in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3)(a) that the individual charged with driving under the influence must take a chemical test “directed by the law enforcement officer,” the result of defendant’s breath test was inadmissible under § 39-20-01(3)(b).

        Department of Transportation properly revoked a driver’s license because probable cause existed to arrest him without considering his onsite screening test where a police officer saw him cross the dividing line between the two lanes and miss the driving lane for an interstate exit, smelled alcohol on him, and the driver admitted to consuming alcohol, the implied consent law did not constitute an unconstitutional condition, and the driver had a reasonable opportunity to consult with an attorney.

        Findings of fact made by a Department of Transportation hearing officer that a driver was not incapable of refusal and that he refused to submit to a blood test were supported by a preponderance of the evidence because none of the law enforcement officers involved had any information that would lead them to believe that the driver had lost consciousness or was disoriented.

        District court did not err in affirming the decision of the Department of Transportation, which suspended a driver’s privileges, because the Department established an exception to the warrant requirement by establishing that the driver freely and voluntarily consented to a breath test after he officer read him the implied consent advisory; a driver’s decision to agree to take a test is not coerced simply because an administrative penalty has been attached to refusing the test.

        In deciding that defendant’s consent to take a chemical test was voluntary, the district court considered the totality of the circumstances and the district court’s determination was based on a correct application of the law. There was sufficient competent evidence to support the district court’s denial of defendant’s motion to suppress evidence and the decision did not go against the manifest weight of the evidence.

        At the time defendant agreed to take the Intoxilyzer 8000 test, nothing existed in the record to support a claim that defendant’s actual consent was involuntary or coerced.

        Phrase “any criminal penalties” in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3)(a) includes all criminal penalties, including penalties for refusal of blood, breath, or urine tests and it is not consistent to read “any criminal penalties” as implicitly referring only to criminal penalties for refusing blood tests; if the officer requests a blood test, there is no reason to warn about consequences for refusing tests that are not requested, and the Legislative Assembly logically excepted warrantless blood tests from the warnings about criminal penalties.

        Warrantless extraction of blood for purpose of a blood-alcohol test from defendant arrested for driving while intoxicated was properly taken as a search incident to arrest where delay to obtain a warrant would threaten destruction of evidence, defendant’s condition established a clear indication that a blood sample would produce evidence of intoxication, and blood sample was taken in a reasonable manner by a registered nurse in a hospital according to accepted medical standards.

         —Advisory Must Be Read After Placing Individual Under Arrest.

       <p>
        To the extent that “inform,” as used in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3)(b), means something more than the officer simply reading the implied-consent advisory, the Supreme Court holds that it must be conveyed in an objectively reasonable way calculated to be comprehensible to the driver. Ordinarily, reading the advisory will be sufficient. State v. Ayala, 2017 ND 126, 894 N.W.2d 865, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        District court properly suppressed the results of defendant’s chemical breath test after a city charged him with actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol because, while a police officer gave the warnings before he placed defendant under arrest, the statutory implied consent advisory must be read after placing an individual under arrest and before administering a chemical test to determine alcohol concentration or the presence of other drugs.

        In a driving under the influence of alcohol case, the district court did not err in finding that defendant was read a complete implied consent advisory under this statute and that she voluntarily consented to chemical testing because, although the trooper added expressions that were legally correct to an otherwise complete advisory, he did not omit any part of the advisory; and, although the district court did not specifically find whether the additional language read by the trooper materially misled or coerced defendant, after being informed of the additional words, the district court found defendant voluntarily consented to the breath test, implying she was not coerced or misled. State v. Dowdy, 2019 ND 50, 923 N.W.2d 109, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 34</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        It was clear from the facts that the officer was attempting to administer a chemical test under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-01" target="_self">39-20-01</a></cite>. Specifically, a warrant was obtained and served, the officer read a partial implied consent advisory, defendant consented, and the urine test was administered. Because the urine test was a test administered under § 39-20-01, the officer was required to inform defendant as required under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3)(a) for the test results to be admissible. Since the implied consent advisory given did not convey all substantive information required by statute, the test result was not admissible. City of Fargo v. Hofer, 2020 ND 252, 952 N.W.2d 58, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 264</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        District court erred in reversing the North Dakota Department of Transportation’s decision to suspend a driver’s license because a police officer’s recitation of the implied consent advisory, which excluded the word “punishable,” substantially with the statute so long as the word “crime” was communicated to the driver; in other words, a driver who was told that “refusal was a crime in the same manner as driving under the influence” was informed that “refusal was a crime.”Leclair v.

       <p>
        District court erred in denying defendant’s motion to suppress because the consent advisory statute required specific information be communicated by law enforcement when requesting an individual arrested for driving under the influence submit to chemical testing, the advisory given to defendant was modified to exclude the reference to urine included in the statute, and the omission of that language could not be rectified by any other language contained in the statute.

        Although the deputy did not inform defendant about the penalties for refusal of breath and urine tests and omitted the information in the second sentence of
   N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3)(a), the deputy’s implied consent advisory satisfied the statute and the blood test was properly admitted.

       <p>
        Case law requires a specific warning from
   N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3)(a) be used in implied consent advisories, but it does not require that the only words an officer may say are those written in the statute; nothing indicates an intent by the legislature to restrict an officer’s speech to only the specific words written in the statute, and instead, the statute provides only the mandatory language that must be included in the advisory.

        Additional information must not materially mislead or coerce the driver; if the additional language provided by the officer is accurate, its presence does not alter the sufficiency of a complete, accurate implied consent advisory under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01(3). Here, the officer did not act improperly by including accurate statutory information before the implied consent advisory, and the additional language read to defendant did not render his consent involuntary and evidence of the blood test was thus admissible. Korb v. N.D. DOT, 2018 ND 226, 918 N.W.2d 49, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 230</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        District court erred in granting defendant’s motion to suppress chemical test evidence and motion in limine because a deputy read defendant the implied consent advisory after his arrest and before administering the blood test, as statutorily required, the district court misapplied the law by finding that there was no need for the second implied consent advisory and that the second advisory was not accurate, and, although the district court considered the patrol car video evidence of the stop and stated it concluded from the totality of the circumstances that the consent was not voluntary, the court did not make any specific findings about the totality of the circumstances or otherwise indicate it properly considered them.

        Implied consent has already been given by the driver through the act of driving - the implied consent advisory is given to allow an opportunity to ratify or withdraw consent.

        Because a defendant did not clearly and unequivocally refuse to submit to a blood test following a citation for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor but had merely attempted to place conditions on where the blood test would occur, defendant had consented to the test, defendant’s consent was implied by N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01, and defendant’s motion to suppress was properly denied.

        Officer was not required to accept independent blood test as a cure for driver’s refusal to submit to an on-site chemical screening test where officer did not arrest driver, because the legislature clearly did not authorize a driver to cure a refusal of on-site screening if he was not arrested.

       <p>
        Driver could not obtain an independent test under this section to cure his refusal to submit to an on-site chemical screening test, alleging his extended and allegedly unreasonable detention was equivalent to an arrest, because, even if the detention was equivalent to an arrest, the officer did not inform the driver that he would be charged with an alcohol offense, and the officer did not direct a test under subsection (4).

        Although
   N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14(4) provides an individual's driving privileges must not be revoked for refusing to submit to a screening test if the individual provides a sufficient breath, blood, or urine sample for a chemical test requested under
   N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01 for the same incident, there is no corresponding language that the driver must be so informed for purposes of the administrative revocation proceeding.

        District court did not err in affirming the order suspending the driver's driving privileges for refusing a breath test because a reasoning mind could have concluded the driver failed to consent to the test, and thus, failed to cure his earlier refusal since he did not unconditionally consent to the breath test; a person seeking to cure a prior refusal had to do so clearly and could not complain of an officer's reasonable interpretation of a conditional statement of willingness to take a test.

        In prosecution for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, evidence regarding the fact that a chemical test for intoxication was refused to be taken by the defendant was not sufficient, standing alone and by itself, to establish the guilt of the defendant, but was a fact which, if proven, could be considered in the light of all other proven facts in deciding the question of guilt or innocence. State v. Murphy, 516 N.W.2d 285, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>
        Trial counsel’s failure to object or ask for a curative instruction when a law enforcement officer testified he asked the defendant to take a blood alcohol test before he was formally placed under arrest and the defendant refused was not an error rising to constitutional dimensions establishing ineffective assistance of counsel; the jury was not instructed that a refusal to submit to the blood alcohol test may be considered in deciding the question of guilt or innocence, and the failure to object may have been a matter of trial tactics.

        Where an officer does not inform a driver that he or she “is or will be charged with” driving under the influence or actual physical control as required by this section, there has been no legally effective request for testing and the driver’s failure to submit to testing is not a “refusal” for purposes of this chapter.

       <p>
        Where there was no valid request under this chapter until the officer afforded the driver his statutorily mandated right to consult an attorney, the driver’s subsequent failure to submit to testing was not a refusal which would support revocation of his license.

        District court did not err in reversing an administrative hearing officer’s decision revoking appellee’s driving privileges for a period of 180 days because appellee was read only a partial implied consent advisory that failed to inform him that refusing to take a chemical test could be treated as a crime and, thus, the request for testing was neither in compliance with this statute nor sufficient to result in a refusal to submit to testing. Accordingly, the administrative determination that appellee refused to take a chemical test was either not in compliance with the law or not supported by the administrative findings. Alvarado v. N.D.

        When a medically qualified person is available and the record shows no other evidence of a justifiable reason to refuse a blood test, the demand to be taken to a hospital as a condition for the draw constitutes a refusal under N.D.C.C. ch. 39-20.

       <p>
        Finding that petitioner refused a blood test after petitioner was arrested for driving while intoxicated was supported by a preponderance of the evidence where each time the officer read the implied consent to petitioner, the response was the same: petitioner swore at the officer and grumbled but would not submit. Hence, an order revoking petitioner’s driver’s license for three years was upheld.

        Driver’s license was properly revoked under the implied consent statute where a driver agreed to submit to a blood test only after the driver talked to a specific lawyer who was not home when the driver called from the hospital and left the lawyer a message; the driver refused to walk to the exam room for the test; and the driver then struggled with a deputy while leaving the hospital saying that the driver would submit but that the driver still wanted to speak to the lawyer first.

        Suspension of driving privileges was proper, because N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05(3) by its terms specifically excluded from consideration at the administrative hearing whether the driver was informed of the consequences of refusal, and a reasoning mind could reasonably conclude that despite the driver’s verbal acquiescence to the chemical testing, the context in which the words were stated, his subsequent threats, and his refusal to cooperate with officers belied any intent to take the test and amounted to a refusal to do so.

        When defendant was arrested for driving under the influence, the officer advised defendant of the implied consent law, including the possible loss of his driving privileges; therefore, the requirements of N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01 were met and defendant’s consent to the blood test was implied. Defendant stated that he was not refusing to submit to the test, but wanted his attorney present; defendant’s quiet statement to the nurse at the hospital that he did not agree to the blood draw, coupled with his silence when the officer gave him an opportunity to clarify, failed to effectively withdraw his consent.

        In an appeal from a judgment of conviction for driving while under the influence of alcohol, where defendant filed three pretrial motions but none raised an issue about the sequence of the implied consent advisory and an arrest, his argument, raised for the first time during trial, was essentially that the result of that blood test was illegally obtained because of an improper law enforcement practice; motions to exclude evidence on that ground must be made prior to trial.

        Although a police officer was informed from a first responder that defendant smelled of alcohol following a fatal car accident, the officer was unable to get close enough to defendant to personally observe him because defendant was receiving life-saving medical treatment at the scene of the accident. The district court’s ruling that exigent circumstances permitted a warrantless blood-alcohol test was supported by sufficient competent evidence in the record and was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. State v. Sauter, 2018 ND 75, 908 N.W.2d 697, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        District court properly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss the results of the chemical blood test he was given at the hospital for failure to provide a complete implied consent advisory because the circumstances of the case fell within the scope of the statute pertaining to the chemical testing of a driver involved in a crash resulting in serious bodily injury or death, and, while the omission of the part of the advisory that would have informed defendant that refusal to submit to a urine or breath test was a crime punishable in the same manner as driving under the influence was a substantive omission, the exclusionary rule did not apply.

        This section was designed to create an exception to our implied-consent law that prohibits chemical testing for blood alcohol content when an individual chooses to refuse, but it does not dispense with the requirement for arrest prior to obtaining a blood sample. State v. Hansen, 444 N.W.2d 330, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 142</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       <p>
        The intent of this section was to withdraw from a driver involved in an accident resulting in death or serious bodily injury the right to refuse the chemical test, but North Dakota has always required an arrest before the chemical test may be taken unless there is voluntary consent to the test without an arrest.

      Only an individual medically qualified to draw blood, acting at the request of a law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood. The director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee shall determine the qualifications or credentials for being medically qualified to draw blood, and shall issue a list of approved designations including medical doctor and registered nurse. This limitation does not apply to the taking of a breath or urine specimen. The director of the state crime laboratory, or the director’s designee, shall electronically post a copy of the certified list of approved designations, including medical doctor and registered nurse, with the state crime laboratory division of the attorney general at the attorney general website and shall make the certified records required by this section available for download in a printable format on the attorney general website. The individual tested may have an individual of the individual’s choosing, who is medically qualified to draw blood, administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer with all costs of an additional test or tests to be the sole responsibility of the individual charged. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by an individual does not preclude the admission of the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer. Upon the request of the individual who is tested, a copy of the operational checklist and test record of a breath sample test or analytical report of a blood or urine sample test taken at the direction of the law enforcement officer must be made available to that individual by the law enforcement agency that administered the test or tests.

        A motorist arrested for driving under the influence has a right to a chemical test in addition to the test taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer. State v. Messner, 481 N.W.2d 236, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 44</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-02, a law enforcement officer who effectuated a proper arrest and consent of the suspect to take a blood test within the officer’s territorial jurisdiction could, while outside the officer’s jurisdiction, request a qualified medical person to conduct the test; the driver’s blood test was conducted in accordance with the statutory requirements and his driving privileges were suspended in accordance with the law. Johnson v. N.D. DOT, 2004 ND 148, 683 N.W.2d 886, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 275</cite> (N.D. 2004).

       <p>
        Because N.D.C.C. § 39-20-02 enumerates the particular genus, chemical tests, prior to stating the general, any administered, the any must be confined to tests of the kind previously and particularly articulated: chemical tests.

        Under this section, a person arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to secure an additional test by a person of his own choosing if he requests one. The meaning of a “reasonable opportunity” to obtain an examination may vary depending on the circumstances. State v. Messner, 481 N.W.2d 236, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Officer did not interfere with or deny a driver’s right to an independent chemical test under the implied consent law, N.D.C.C. § 39-20-02, because the driver’s question about whether she would be taken to the hospital for a blood draw was not a clear request for an independent test but was simply a question as to where the test would take place.
   Lange v. N.D. DOT, 2010 ND 201, 790 N.W.2d 28, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 203</cite> (N.D. 2010).

       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 39-20-02 authorizes a person tested under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01 to obtain an independent test to rebut the officer’s chosen test. Law enforcement cannot administer a test under § 39-20-01 unless and until he has arrested the driver, and informed the driver that he is or will be charged with driving under the influence or being in actual physical control. An independent test cannot cure someone’s refusal to be tested unless that person has been in continuous police custody. To the extent that the Supreme Court of North Dakota may have previously implied a refusal can be cured with an independent test without also taking the chemical test requested by law enforcement, it holds now it cannot. However, in some cases, that reasonable opportunity for an independent test may arise before a test has been administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. City of West Fargo v. Williams, 2019 ND 161, 930 N.W.2d 102, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        Plain reading of N.D.C.C. § 39-20-02 requires that the right to an additional independent test only arises when the driver submits to the chemical test requested by law enforcement. City of West Fargo v. Williams, 2019 ND 161, 930 N.W.2d 102, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        District court erred in finding that defendant was denied a reasonable opportunity to cure his refusal to submit to a chemical test where he had not requested an additional test after his refusal of the chemical test, nor had he consented or submitted to any chemical testing requested by law enforcement after being arrested and informed of his charges. The only testing that took place (field sobriety and on-site breath screening test) occurred prior to arrest and information of charges. City of West Fargo v.

        Hearing officer’s conclusion that defendant was not prevented from having his own test was reasonable, where arresting officer gave defendant the opportunity to have his own test conducted at the hospital where the state’s test was conducted, although defendant had requested that his own test be conducted at another hospital nearby, but sheriff’s office had notice that the hospital chosen by defendant did not have qualified staff on duty and defendant failed to present evidence that he could have obtained a test at that hospital.

        State supreme court, reviewing the state transportation agency’s decision to suspend the motorist’s driving privileges under the Administrative Agencies Practice Act, N.D.C.C. § 28-32-01 et seq., was not authorized to grant the motorist relief under any ground set forth in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_blank">28-32-46</a></cite>. Although the motorist claimed that police, who had arrested the motorist for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, had the obligation to transport the motorist to the independent blood test the motorist requested under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-02, that statutory provision actually placed the duty on the motorist to arrange and take the independent blood test and the police did nothing to interfere with that right.

If the individual was issued a temporary operator’s permit because of the results of a test, the report must show that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the individual had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while in violation of section 39-08-01, or equivalent ordinance, that the individual was lawfully arrested, that the individual was tested for alcohol concentration under this chapter, and that the results of the test show that the individual had an alcohol concentration of at least eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight or, with respect to an individual under twenty-one years of age, an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight. In addition to the operator’s license and report, the law enforcement officer shall forward to the director a certified copy of the operational checklist and test records of a breath test and a copy of the certified copy of the analytical report for a blood or urine test for all tests administered at the direction of the officer.

        “Performance of a chemical test” under this section, should not be interpreted differently depending on the type of chemical test administered. A chemical test meets the requirement of performance once the sample, whether it is blood, breath, or urine, is preserved for analysis; thus, when a breath test is given, all eight tests in the testing sequence need not be completed within two hours to satisfy this section. Phipps v. N.D. DOT, 2002 ND 112, 646 N.W.2d 704, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 2002).

       <p>
        For purposes of the “within two hours” requirement in this section, a driver’s performance of a chemical test at 2:49 a.m. was within two hours of 12:49 a.m., the time the driver was driving. Phipps v. N.D. DOT, 2002 ND 112, 646 N.W.2d 704, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        Where defendant argued that if a test could reasonably be performed in ten minutes, there was no reason why an arrestee would not have one hour and fifty minutes to consult with an attorney; it is not appropriate to measure the reasonableness of an accused’s opportunity to contact an attorney by the maximum amount of time that the police may have to administer the most useful test to prove a licensee’s intoxication.

        Although the unexplained delay of more than one month between the testing of intoxicated motorist’s blood and the giving of notice of intention to suspend driving privileges did not strictly comply with “the letter of the law,” the court would seek to avoid absurd results; it would be an absurd result if, in the absence of any showing of harm or prejudice to motorist, the court were to hold the officer’s failure to strictly comply with the statute resulted in motorist retaining his driving privileges. Samdahl v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp. Director, 518 N.W.2d 714, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        The testing officer’s certified written report is a regularly kept record of the commissioner, and as such, its contents are entitled to prima facie effect. Salter v. Hjelle, 415 N.W.2d 801, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 438</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The testing officer’s certified written report did not address itself to the issue of fair administration, let alone establish it, and did not provide the necessary foundation for a test record without a checklist. Salter v. Hjelle, 415 N.W.2d 801, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 438</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (3) does not require the officer’s original certified copy of the checklist and test records be admitted at the hearing; the director’s certified copy is sufficient under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05(4). Rudolph v. North Dakota DOT Director, 539 N.W.2d 63, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly affirmed a decision by the Department of Transportation suspending defendant's driving privileges for 91 days because the hearing officer did not abuse her discretion in admitting the results of defendant's blood test or the foundational documents where the documents introduced into evidence and certified by the director of the state crime laboratory and a trooper's testimony established that defendant's blood sample was properly obtained, the blood test was fairly administered, an approved method was used, and the test was performed by an authorized person. Filkowski v. Dir., N.D. Dep't of Transp., 2015 ND 104, 862 N.W.2d 785, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        When a motorist fails a blood alcohol test, while this section requires the officer to forward the operator’s license to the director of the department of transportation, the failure to do so does not destroy the director’s jurisdiction to suspend a violator’s driving privileges, as a contrary holding would defeat the legislature’s intent to protect the public from potential hazards posed by intoxicated drivers. Schwind v. Director, N.D. Dep't of Transp., 462 N.W.2d 147, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Under subsection (3) of this section and N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05(4), the certified breath test operator does not have to be the person who personally forwards or transmits the checklist and test results to the department. Frost v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 487 N.W.2d 6, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The command of this section that all tests be forwarded to department of transportation (DOT) is basic and mandatory; it precludes a police officer’s exercise of choice and requires the transmittal of “all tests.” The legislature has made it the hearing officer’s domain, not the police officer’s, to judge the foundational facts for the admissibility of test results and the weight to be given to each of those results. Therefore, a police officer’s failure to submit Intoxilyzer test records deprived DOT of authority to suspend defendant’s driver privileges. Bosch v. Moore, 517 N.W.2d 412, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Department of Transportation lacked jurisdiction to suspend a driver’s driving privileges for driving under the influence, where a report and notice form did not indicate any test results, as required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-03" target="_self">39-20-03</a></cite>.1(3); inclusion of the test result in the arresting officer’s certified report to the Department was a basic and mandatory provision of the statute.
   Jorgensen v. N.D. DOT, 2005 ND 80, 695 N.W.2d 212, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in applying the ten-day period for notice of a hearing in N.D.C.C. § 28-32-21(1)(d) to the proceeding to suspend the driver’s driving privileges; the notice complied with the requirements of N.D.C.C. ch. 39-20 and was reasonable, and the North Dakota Department of Transportation had the authority to suspend the driver’s driving privileges.
   Schaaf v. N.D. DOT, 2009 ND 145, 771 N.W.2d 237, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 2009).

        Subsection (3) of this section does not require an arresting officer to forward to the department all records accompanying a driver’s blood test, but only a copy of the certified copy of the analytical report. Wingerter v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 530 N.W.2d 362, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly upheld an order suspending appellant’s driving privileges after appellant was arrested for DUI because although the arresting officer failed to follow the technical requirements, appellant failed to establish that the officer’s error was basic and mandatory to the North Dakota DOT’s authority to proceed; there was no finding that appellant was prejudiced by the officer’s erroneous certification of the Report and Notice form.
   Ike v. Dir., N.D. DOT, 2008 ND 85, 748 N.W.2d 692, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2008).

        Where a blood sample was discarded because only a small amount of blood was taken, and a second blood sample was taken and tested, no analytical report of the first sample was made and the mandate of subsection (3) was not met.

        The statutory requirements for breath tests only require test records to be forwarded, not all documents or articles connected in any way with a breath test; the statute does not require the mouthpiece the driver blows into to be forwarded to the director. Lamb v. Moore, 539 N.W.2d 862, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 207</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        It was error to reverse the administrative suspension of a driver’s driving privileges when a law enforcement officer’s certified written report under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-03" target="_self">39-20-03</a></cite>.1(4) did not include the phrase “by weight” with the results of the driver’s blood alcohol test because it was unclear how adding the phrase would provide more information to the driver, as (1) the report referred to N.D.C.C. ch. 39-20, (2) the officer noted the driver submitted to a breath test, and (3) the officer wrote the results in the report’s “Test Results” blank, quickly, conveniently, and certainly informing the driver what the officer relied on and letting the driver decide whether to seek a hearing. 2014 ND 24, 842 N.W.2d 877, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        The hearing officer could reasonably infer from the evidence that the report and notice form was actually received by the department within five days on November 10, 1994, not November 10, 1993, and that the date stamp showing otherwise was simply a mistake.

        Affirmation of an order suspending the driver’s driving privileges for 180 days was improper because the Department of Transportation failed to transmit a record compiled in the administrative proceedings. Although the hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in setting the hearing date, the Department failed to certify a record on appeal to the district court, and there was no record on appeal establishing the Department’s authority under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-03" target="_self">39-20-03</a></cite>.1 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-04" target="_self">39-20-04</a></cite>.1 to suspend the driver’s driving privileges.

        Revocation of the petitioner’s driving privileges was proper, because the petitioner had a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney, when the petitioner waited over ten minutes before making a call, and rather than calling an attorney the petitioner called a friend; based on the testimony regarding the petitioner’s continued attempts to change the focus of the investigation, his refusal to follow instructions and his complaints about being uncomfortable in the officer’s patrol vehicle, a reasonable mind could have determined the petitioner was trying to delay the investigation.

      If a person licensed in another state refuses in this state to submit to a test provided under section 39-20-01 or 39-20-14, or who submits to a test under section 39-20-01 or 39-20-02 and the test results show the person to have an alcohol concentration of at least eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight or, with respect to a person under twenty-one years of age, an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight at the time of performance of a test within two hours after driving or being in physical control of a motor vehicle, the following procedures apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-03.3ol11">
       Without taking possession of the person’s out-of-state operator’s license, the law enforcement officer shall issue to the person a notification of the test results and a temporary operator’s permit extending nonresident operating privileges in this state for twenty-five days from the date of issuance or until earlier terminated by the decision of a hearing officer under section 39-20-05. The temporary permit must be signed and dated by the officer and serves as the director’s official notification to the person of the director’s intent to revoke, suspend, or deny driving privileges in this state, and of the hearing procedures under this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-03.3ol12">
       If the test was administered by urine sample or by drawing blood, the law enforcement officer, on reviewing the alcohol concentration analysis showing the individual had an alcohol concentration of at least eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight or, with respect to an individual under twenty-one years of age, an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight, shall mail or issue to the individual a notification of the test results, a temporary operator’s permit extending nonresident operating privileges in this state for twenty-five days from the date of mailing or issuance or until earlier terminated by the decision of a hearing officer under section 39-20-05, and notice of the intent to revoke, suspend, or deny driving privileges in this state, together with the notice provided under section 39-06.1-07 of the procedures available under this chapter. The temporary operator’s permit must be signed and dated by the officer. The third day after the mailing of the temporary operator’s permit is considered the date of issuance.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-03.3ol13">
       The law enforcement officer, within five days of issuing the temporary operator’s permit, shall forward to the director a certified written report in the form required by the director and a certified copy of the operational checklist and test records of a breath test and a copy of the certified copy of the analytical report for a blood or urine test for all tests administered at the direction of the officer. If the individual was issued a temporary operator’s permit because of the individual’s refusal to submit to a test under sections 39-20-01 and 39-20-14, the report must include information as provided in section 39-20-04. If the individual was issued a temporary operator’s permit because of the results of a test, the report must show that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe the individual had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while in violation of section 39-08-01, or equivalent ordinance, that the individual was lawfully arrested, that the individual was tested for alcohol concentration under this chapter, and that the results of the test show that the individual had an alcohol concentration of at least eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight or, with respect to an individual under twenty-one years of age, an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight.

        If a driver violates N.D.C.C. § 39-08-01, and refuses to submit to a test to determine his blood alcohol content, his driver’s license can be revoked under this section. Fetzer v. Director, North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 474 N.W.2d 71, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1991), overruled in part, Suelzle v. N.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        The implied consent law provides that a refusal to submit to a chemical test by a driver arrested for driving under the influence will result in the administrative suspension of driving privileges. Ehrlich v. Backes, 477 N.W.2d 211, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        No doubt driving is an important privilege today, but a driver’s license is not constitutionally guaranteed. Rather, a driver’s license is subject to control and regulation by the state, although the privilege is protected by due process, and a regulated privilege is not a right.
   North Dakota Dep't of Transp. v. DuPaul, 487 N.W.2d 593, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>
        All persons who refuse to submit to a chemical test are treated in the same manner, and revocation of such persons’ operator’s licenses is mandatory, not discretionary, and is not unreasonable, capricious, or arbitrary even though another statute permits issuance of temporary, restricted license to persons convicted of certain offenses, including driving under the influence. Gableman v. Hjelle, 224 N.W.2d 379, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the constitutionality of implied consent laws as an unconstitutional condition had not been briefed or argued by either party in any meaningful way, the supreme court did not address the issue. McCoy v. North Dakota DOT, 2014 ND 119, 848 N.W.2d 659, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        North Dakota's implied consent law as challenged, either on its face or as applied, does not violate the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution applying either general Fourth Amendment principles or under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. Beylund v. Levi, 2015 ND 18, 859 N.W.2d 403, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 19</cite> (N.D. 2015), vacated, 579 U.S. 438, 136 S. Ct. 2160, 195 L. Ed. 2d 560, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 4058 (U.S. 2016).

        A person must affirmatively refuse to participate in blood-alcohol test in order to effectively withdraw implied consent given state as provided in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01; therefore, driver did not effectively revoke his implied consent to have a blood-alcohol test administered to him, and results of such test were properly admissible into evidence, where, although he refused to sign request and notice form concerning test, he participated in test and had been read implied consent advisory required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-01" target="_self">39-20-01</a></cite>.

        Subsection (2) of this section lists the criteria to be met if a driver who pleads guilty to criminal charges is not to be subject to administrative revocation of his license for refusing a test. These criteria require that the driver not request an administrative hearing and that the driver, within 25 days after issuance of a temporary operator’s permit, both plead guilty to violating N.D.C.C. § 39-08-01 and notify the department of the plea. Fetzer v. Director, North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 474 N.W.2d 71, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1991), overruled in part, Suelzle v. N.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to make a timely request for hearing or to timely file an affidavit with the department results in an automatic revocation of the person’s driver’s privileges. Because a driver who fails to file a timely affidavit has no clear legal right to avoid revocation of driving privileges for refusing a chemical test, a trial court abuses its discretion in granting a writ of mandamus directing the department to substitute a 91-day suspension in lieu of the one-year revocation. Krabseth v. Moore, 1997 ND 224, 571 N.W.2d 146, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 280</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Fact that criminal charge of driving under influence was dismissed, without hearing did not deprive highway commissioner of power to revoke driver’s license of one who had refused to submit to Breathalyzer test. Smestad v. Ellingson, 191 N.W.2d 799, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1971).

        Revocation of a driver’s license under this section is a civil proceeding and the dismissal or acquittal of the related criminal charge is irrelevant to the license revocation proceeding.

       <p>
        Although the chemical test should be administered without unreasonable delay, a delay for a reasonable period of time while an arrested person decides whether or not to submit to testing will not frustrate the purpose of the law, and where a driver at first refuses to take the test and then changes his mind within a reasonable time, the subsequent consent cures the first refusal if the test would still be accurate and would result in no substantial inconvenience or expense to the police and if the individual has been in police custody and under observation for the whole time since the arrest. Lund v. Hjelle, 224 N.W.2d 552, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1974).

       <p>
        Administrative proceedings suspending drivers’ licenses are civil in nature, separate and distinct from any criminal proceedings from an arrest for violating N.D.C.C. § 39-08-01, and dismissal or acquittal of a related criminal charge is irrelevant to the administrative proceedings. State v. Zimmerman, 539 N.W.2d 49, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Criminal and administrative proceedings for the same conduct do not constitute double jeopardy because the administrative action serves the remedial goal of protecting the public from impaired drivers, and the suspension of the license is not greatly disproportionate to the remedial goal. State v. Zimmerman, 539 N.W.2d 49, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        Trial courts properly held that the North Dakota Department of Transportation had authority to revoke plaintiffs’
   driving privileges after they were arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and refused to consent to sobriety tests because N.D.C.C. § 39-20-04 did not require the police officers’

        An officer may stop a motorist under circumstances short of probable cause for arrest. Borman v. Tschida, 171 N.W.2d 757, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1969); State v. Kolb, 239 N.W.2d 815, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 207</cite> (N.D. 1976).

        Where defendant’s vehicle was driven in erratic manner, defendant did not stop until after arresting officer had put on his signal lights and followed defendant considerable distance, defendant had moderate odor of alcohol on his breath, his eyes were bloodshot, he admitted he had been drinking, and he swayed and jerked during balance test, arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe defendant had been driving while under the influence of alcohol. Witte v. Hjelle, 234 N.W.2d 16, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 1975).

        Arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe defendant was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor where officer found defendant slumped behind steering wheel of a car parked at an angle on a public street with its lights on and engine running, defendant’s speech was slurred, defendant smelled of alcohol, defendant admitted he had been drinking, and defendant stumbled and leaned against car for support in attempt to walk to the rear of the vehicle; under such circumstances, any error in administering an on-site chemical screening test was harmless error. Asbridge v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 291 N.W.2d 739, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1980).

       <p>
        As used in this section, the term “reasonable grounds” is synonymous with “probable cause” and “reasonable cause”. Asbridge v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 291 N.W.2d 739, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1980).

        Where before a stop, officer received a radio dispatch describing a car that had struck a viaduct and a second radio message that the car’s “driving was awful,” where officer spotted defendant weaving in and out of traffic without signalling lane changes, where defendant’s car and license number closely matched the radioed description and location, the agency found that officer had articulable and reasonable grounds to stop defendant when officer observed defendant’s driving, and the evidence reasonably supported that finding.
   North Dakota Dep't of Transp. v. DuPaul, 487 N.W.2d 593, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>
        Leaving the presence of an officer in an aggressive manner, accelerating motorcycle at a high rate of speed, revving the engine, and screaming through the gears, supported hearing officer’s finding defendant’s driving was “erratic,” which, together with police officer’s belief defendant had been driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and the fact defendant did not have a motorcycle license, established probable cause to arrest defendant and supported hearing officer’s revocation of his driving privileges. Chadwick v. Moore, 551 N.W.2d 783, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Deputy’s Report and Notice form showed that the deputy had probable cause to arrest a driver for driving under the influence of alcohol without a more detailed written statement of the facts where the deputy checked boxes on the form indicating that the driver was already stopped, there was an odor of alcohol, the driver had poor balance, and the driver failed field sobriety tests.

        Department of Transportation hearing officer had the authority to suspend a driver’s privileges because the conclusion that the arresting officer included sufficient information on the report and notice form to show reasonable grounds to believe the driver had been driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was supported by the findings of fact; the driver was involved in a single vehicle motorcycle accident, and officers observed an odor of alcohol coming from him.

       <p>
        Petitioner who was arrested for probable cause for drunken driving and refused request to take Breathalyzer test on ground that it would tend to incriminate him came within the provisions of this section. Smestad v. Ellingson, 191 N.W.2d 799, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant agreed to submit to blood test but changed his mind and offered to submit to Breathalyzer test instead, defendant’s refusal to submit to test chosen by arresting officer made him subject to license revocation proceedings even though officer’s refusal to allow Breathalyzer test was due to his erroneous belief that its result would be inadmissible. Clairmont v. Hjelle, 234 N.W.2d 13, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s refusal to submit to a chemical test could not be revoked or remedied by his later request to be given the test where defendant had left the police station and was not in custody or observation for a short time between the initial refusal and the later request to be given the test. Asbridge v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 291 N.W.2d 739, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section specifies that if a person refuses to submit to testing under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01 or 39-20-14, none shall be given. This language requires an affirmative refusal to take the test. State v. Solberg, 381 N.W.2d 197, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A driver has only a conditional right to refuse a chemical test; among the conditions imposed upon the exercise of one’s right to refuse a chemical test are the revocation of the person’s license or permit to drive a vehicle and the admission in evidence of proof of refusal in civil or criminal actions. State v. Murphy, 527 N.W.2d 254, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A driver can cure an initial refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test, notwithstanding the fact that the officer issued a temporary operator’s permit and mailed the report and notice form to the department of transportation by the time of the request. Krehlik v. Moore, 542 N.W.2d 443, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        After 20 to 25 minutes of unsuccessfully trying to persuade arrested driver to submit to a chemical test, the police officer abandoned his efforts; the hearing officer properly concluded that driver’s continually avoiding or ignoring the officer’s request for a test effectively constituted refusal to submit to the test, and the revocation of the driver’s license was in accordance with the law. Obrigewitch v. Dir., N.D. DOT, 2002 ND 177, 653 N.W.2d 73, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motorist’s refusal to submit to an onsite screening test pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14 justified revocation of motorist’s license, as described in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-04(1)(a). Wetsch v. N.D. DOT, 2004 ND 93, 679 N.W.2d 282, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding that petitioner refused a blood test after petitioner was arrested for driving while intoxicated was supported by a preponderance of the evidence where each time the officer read the implied consent to petitioner, the response was the same: petitioner swore at the officer and grumbled but would not submit.
   Grosgebauer v. N.D. DOT, 2008 ND 75, 747 N.W.2d 510, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was arrested for driving under the influence, he told the arresting officer that he was not refusing to submit to a blood draw but wanted his attorney present; after he was unable to contact his attorney, a nurse proceeded with the blood test. Defendant’s quiet statement that he did not agree to the blood draw, coupled with his silence when given an opportunity to clarify, failed to effectively withdraw his consent for purposes of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-04" target="_self">39-20-04</a></cite>.
   State v. Johnson, 2009 ND 167, 772 N.W.2d 591, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Suspension of driving privileges was proper, because N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05(3) by its terms specifically excluded from consideration at the administrative hearing whether the driver was informed of the consequences of refusal, and a reasoning mind could reasonably conclude that despite the driver’s verbal acquiescence to the chemical testing, the context in which the words were stated, his subsequent threats, and his refusal to cooperate with officers belied any intent to take the test and amounted to a refusal to do so.
   Gardner v. N.D. DOT, 2012 ND 223, 822 N.W.2d 55, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in affirming the decision of the Department of Transportation, which suspended a driver’s privileges, because the Department established an exception to the warrant requirement by establishing that the driver freely and voluntarily consented to a breath test after he officer read him the implied consent advisory; a driver’s decision to agree to take a test is not coerced simply because an administrative penalty has been attached to refusing the test. McCoy v. North Dakota DOT, 2014 ND 119, 848 N.W.2d 659, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Department of Transportation properly revoked a driver's driving privilege for refusal to submit to an onsite screening test of his breath because a law enforcement officer had a reasonable suspicion he was driving while impaired; the officer observed the driver's vehicle speeding and initiated a traffic stop, the driver had bloodshot watery eyes, and he admitted he had a couple of beers.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Proceedings under the implied consent law are civil in nature and there being no right to counsel in a civil proceeding, refusing to submit to a chemical test until counsel is consulted is an unreasonable refusal.
   Agnew v. Hjelle, 216 N.W.2d 291, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 238</cite> (N.D. 1974); Lund v. Hjelle, 224 N.W.2d 552, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The duty to assure the integrity of a breath sample requires the officer to maintain observation of the subject, and necessarily limits the extent of the privacy available under the circumstances for a suspect’s consultation with counsel. Bickler v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 423 N.W.2d 146, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Out-of-earshot consultation adequately protects both the confidentiality of attorney-client consultation and the integrity of chemical tests; therefore, when an arrested person asks to consult with counsel before electing to take a chemical test he must be given the opportunity to do so out of police hearing, (not necessarily out of sight), and law enforcement must establish that such opportunity was provided. Bickler v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 423 N.W.2d 146, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        If an arrested person ask to consult with an attorney before deciding to take a chemical test, he must be given a reasonable opportunity to do so if it does not materially interfere with the administration of the test, and if he is not given a reasonable opportunity to do so under the circumstances, his failure to take the test is not a refusal upon which to revoke his license. Kuntz v. State Highway Comm'r, 405 N.W.2d 285, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 311</cite> (N.D. 1987), limited, Jesser v. N.D. DOT, 2019 ND 287, 936 N.W.2d 102, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where driver requested but was not given a reasonable opportunity to consult with an attorney, his failure to take the intoxilyzer test was not a refusal upon which his license could be revoked. Baillie v. Moore, 522 N.W.2d 748, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 213</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no rule that a police officer notify an accused about how long he may have to contact an attorney; circumstances will vary, and defendant had a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney. Boyce v. Backes, 488 N.W.2d 45, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a DUI arrestee, upon being asked to submit to a chemical test, responds with any mention of a need for an attorney—to see one, to talk to one, to have one, etc.—the failure to allow the arrestee a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney prevents the revocation of his license for refusal to take the test; refusal to take the test under these conditions is not the affirmative refusal necessary to revoke a license under this section. Baillie v. Moore, 522 N.W.2d 748, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 213</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision suspending a driver’s license for one year was properly affirmed, under N.D.C.C. §§ 28-32-49, 28-32-46, because the driver was not denied a reasonable opportunity to speak with counsel because an arresting officer made attempts to contact an attorney for the driver, the driver suggested no other attorney with whom he wished to consult, and the driver did not ask for a phone or directory to use himself.
   Lies v. Dir., N.D. DOT, 2008 ND 30, 744 N.W.2d 783, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the officers failed to abide by the Baillie rule in not providing a licensee with a reasonable opportunity to consult with an attorney after he made a qualifying affirmative mention of an attorney, the Department of Transportation could not revoke his driver's license under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-04 based upon his refusal to submit to chemical testing. Washburn v. Levi, 2015 ND 299, 872 N.W.2d 605, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 306</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Revocation of a driving under the influence of alcohol arrestee's driving privileges was proper because a preponderance of the evidence supported the hearing officer's factual finding that the arrestee did not request to speak with an attorney before submitting to a chemical test; the arrestee's reference to “lawyer up,” which was mixed in with a barrage of profanity launched at the deputy was beyond the bright line standard against which a purported request for an attorney were judged.

        Where person was arrested for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and the arresting officer gave defendant the Miranda Rights and later asked the person if he would submit to a breathalyzer test without informing that person of the consequences of his refusal to take the test, the person’s refusal to take the test was not justified by the arresting officer’s failure to inform of the consequences of a refusal, and the refusal to take the test was a sufficient basis to suspend the person’s driver’s license where the evidence did not establish that the person was confused about his rights when he refused the test. Hammeren v. North Dakota State Hwy. Comm’r, 315 N.W.2d 679 (N.D. 1982), decided prior to the amendment to N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01, by Session Laws 1983, ch. 415.

        An appeal from a district court judgment involving a license suspension under this section is governed by the Administrative Agencies Practice Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 28-32. Moser v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 369 N.W.2d 650, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 337</cite> (N.D. 1985); Rudolph v. North Dakota DOT Director, 539 N.W.2d 63, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        An appeal from a district court judgment involving a license suspension is governed by the Administrative Agencies Practice Act, and review is limited to an examination of the record compiled before the administrative agency, rather than the findings of the district court. Berger v. State Highway Comm'r, 394 N.W.2d 678, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 423</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        Review of the state highway commissioner’s suspension of defendant’s license is governed by the Administrative Agencies Practice Act, and is limited to an examination of the record compiled before the administrative agency rather than the findings of the district court; review of the factual basis of an administrative decision is a determination of whether the hearing officer’s findings are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Vogel v. Director, N.D. Dep't of Transp., 462 N.W.2d 129, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Where defendant contended the department lost jurisdiction to suspend his license because the approved operating procedure was not followed in the administration of the intoxilyzer test, but defendant did not raise this issue at the administrative hearing, the court declined to review it. Lamb v. Moore, 539 N.W.2d 862, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 207</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        District court’s ruling was reversed, where it found hearing officer erred in concluding it was reasonable that report required to be forwarded to department of transportation within five days under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-03" target="_self">39-20-03</a></cite>.1(3) was received timely, though it was issued March 15, and showed a receipt date of March 14.

        Suspension of the driver’s operating license for two years was reversed and remanded because N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-04" target="_self">39-20-04</a></cite>.1(1)(d) clearly indicated a two-year suspension was authorized if the prior offense, not the current offense, involved a blood alcohol content of .18 percent or greater; the driver’s blood alcohol content for his current arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol was .19 percent, and the driver’s blood alcohol content from his prior offense was .05 percent.
   Larsen v. N.D. DOT, 2005 ND 51, 693 N.W.2d 39, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 49</cite> (N.D. 2005).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Criminal and administrative proceedings for the same conduct do not constitute double jeopardy because the administrative action serves the remedial goal of protecting the public from impaired drivers, and the suspension of the license is not greatly disproportionate to the remedial goal. State v. Zimmerman, 539 N.W.2d 49, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative proceedings suspending drivers’ licenses are civil in nature, separate and distinct from any criminal proceedings from an arrest for violating N.D.C.C. § 39-08-01, and dismissal or acquittal of a related criminal charge is irrelevant to the administrative proceedings. State v. Zimmerman, 539 N.W.2d 49, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A lengthy administrative suspension of a driver’s license for repeated drunk driving is remedial, and not punishment that would bar later criminal prosecution because of double jeopardy. State v. Barth, 545 N.W.2d 162, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Administrative hearing notice sent to a DUI defendant which stated the proposed suspension period was 91 days did not fairly alert the driver that his prior DUI conviction would be considered for purposes of enhancing the proposed suspension period, and thus the district court properly reduced the suspension period from 365 days to 91 days. Morrell v. North Dakota DOT, 1999 ND 140, 598 N.W.2d 111, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Substantial evidence supported the North Dakota Department of Transportation’s decision to suspend a driver’s license for 91 days for driving under the influence because the evidence showed that the driver owned a vehicle found in a ditch, the driver was found at a nearby restaurant, footprints leading away from the driver’s side matched the driver’s boots, the driver had the keys, and the driver admitted leaving a bar within two hours of the administration of an Intoxilyzer test. Dettler v. Sprynczynatyk, 2004 ND 54, 676 N.W.2d 799, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        Suspension of defendant’s license was reinstated, where hearing officer’s finding defendant was validly tested within two hours of the time of driving was supported by her statement to trooper her last drink was at 8:35 p.m. and accident happened a few minutes before trooper arrived at 8:44, and she was tested at 10:16 p.m. Russell v. Moore, 1997 ND 111, 564 N.W.2d 278, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Hearing officer’s finding that the police officer administered the breath test within two hours of the driver’s driving a vehicle was supported by a preponderance of the evidence; the hearing officer took official notice of daylight savings time under N.D.C.C. § 28-32-24(7) and found that the police officer administered the test within two hours of stopping the driver for a traffic violation.

The statute provided for the suspension of the driver’s license as he was under 21 when he operated a motor vehicle with an alcohol concentration of at least .02% by weight.

        It was error to reverse the Department of Transportation’s (Department) hearing officer’s decision suspending a driver’s license because a notation in the driver’s driving record kept by the Department was adequate to find the driver’s license was previously suspended within seven years of the driver’s most recent arrest, justifying an enhanced suspension, as the Department’s regularly kept driving records, and specifically notations, only had to be “readily ascertainable” to the Department’s director and designees, and the driver did not rebut the Department’s interpretation of the driver’s driving record.

        Affirmation of an order suspending the driver’s driving privileges for 180 days was improper because the Department of Transportation failed to transmit a record compiled in the administrative proceedings. Although the hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in setting the hearing date, the Department failed to certify a record on appeal to the district court, and there was no record on appeal establishing the Department’s authority under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-03" target="_self">39-20-03</a></cite>.1 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-04" target="_self">39-20-04</a></cite>.1 to suspend the driver’s driving privileges.

        Officer had probable cause to arrest motorist for being in control of vehicle while intoxicated where motorist was found asleep in parked vehicle with engine running and lights on and officer detected odor of alcohol inside the vehicle, defendant appeared confused, defendant’s eyes were bloodshot, and defendant had difficulty maintaining his balance and had difficulty speaking.

        Where officer observed defendant commit a moving violation, by crossing the center line, and her observation gave her a valid basis to stop defendant’s vehicle, the validity of the stop was not vitiated merely because the officer subjectively stopped the vehicle for another reason, i.e., another officer told her to, which, in itself, may not have provided an adequate basis for the stop.

       <p>
        Revocation of the petitioner’s driving privileges was proper, because the petitioner had a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney, when the petitioner waited over ten minutes before making a call, and rather than calling an attorney the petitioner called a friend; based on the testimony regarding the petitioner’s continued attempts to change the focus of the investigation, his refusal to follow instructions and his complaints about being uncomfortable in the officer’s patrol vehicle, a reasonable mind could have determined the petitioner was trying to delay the investigation.

        Where officer testified he noted there was time to perform test within two hours from the time of defendant’s driving, and the Department of Transportation’s Report and Notice Form, a regularly kept record of the department admissible as prima facie evidence of its contents, set the time of defendant’s test within two hours after the time he was driving, a reasoning mind could reasonably have found defendant was tested within two hours of the time he was driving.

        The two-hour limitation in this section narrows the reasonable period of time within which a person arrested for driving under the influence and refuses to submit to a blood test may change his or her mind and consent to a blood test.

       <p>
        An attempted cure of a refusal to take a blood alcohol test need not be honored if there is only a theoretical possibility a chemical test could be concluded within two hours; rather, the standard is whether the proffered test could reasonably be taken before the expiration of the two hour limit.

       Before issuing an order of suspension, revocation, or denial under section 39-20-04 or 39-20-04.1, the director shall afford that person an opportunity for a hearing if the person mails or communicates by other means authorized by the director a request for the hearing to the director within ten days after the date of issuance of the temporary operator’s permit. Upon completion of the hearing, an individual may elect to participate in the twenty-four seven sobriety program under chapter 54-12. The hearing must be held within thirty days after the date of issuance of the temporary operator’s permit. If no hearing is requested within the time limits in this section, and no affidavit is submitted within the time limits under subsection 2 of section 39-20-04, and if the individual has not provided the director with written notice of election to participate in the twenty-four seven sobriety program under chapter 54-12, the expiration of the temporary operator’s permit serves as the director’s official notification to the person of the revocation, suspension, or denial of driving privileges in this state.

       If the issue to be determined by the hearing concerns license suspension for operating a motor vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of at least eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight or, with respect to an individual under twenty-one years of age, an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight, the hearing must be before a hearing officer assigned by the director and at a time and place designated by the director. The hearing must be recorded and its scope may cover only the issues of whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to believe the individual had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle in violation of section 39-08-01 or equivalent ordinance or, with respect to an individual under twenty-one years of age, the individual had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight; whether the individual was placed under arrest, unless the individual was under twenty-one years of age and the alcohol concentration was less than eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight, then arrest is not required and is not an issue under any provision of this chapter; whether the individual was tested in accordance with section 39-20-01 and, if applicable, section 39-20-02; and whether the test results show the individual had an alcohol concentration of at least eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight or, with respect to an individual under twenty-one years of age, an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight.

The hearing must be recorded. The scope of a hearing for refusing to submit to a test under section 39-20-01 may cover only the issues of whether a law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle in violation of section 39-08-01 or equivalent ordinance or, with respect to a person under twenty-one years of age, the person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a vehicle while having an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight; whether the person was placed under arrest; and whether that person refused to submit to the test or tests. The scope of a hearing for refusing to submit to a test under section 39-20-14 may cover only the issues of whether the law enforcement officer had reason to believe the person committed a moving traffic violation or was involved in a traffic accident as a driver, whether in conjunction with the violation or the accident the officer has, through the officer’s observations, formulated an opinion that the person’s body contains alcohol and, whether the person refused to submit to the onsite screening test.

        A person who is denied a reasonable opportunity to consult an attorney, and then fails to take a chemical test, does not refuse the test for purposes of revoking a driver’s license. Therefore, in considering whether or not a person has refused to take a blood test, thereby warranting revocation of his driver’s license, the hearing officer must first determine whether the driver has been offered a reasonable opportunity to consult an attorney.

        Defendant was not prejudiced where, after his administrative hearing, the hearing officer advised him and his counsel that he was “going to take the information that I have today back to Bismarck and make a written decision tomorrow on this”, where defendant’s counsel did not object or question the hearing officer, nor did he draw the wording of subsection (5) of this section to the hearing officer’s attention, where the hearing officer assured him that there would be no prejudice to him resulting from the hearing officer’s delay in making a ruling, and where the hearing officer changed the form to allow him to drive.

        Police officers who told a driver some facts about his temporary permit, but failed to make it clear to him that he had only five days in which to request a hearing under this section, did not act improperly or mislead the driver so as to be liable for damages, where the temporary permit clearly indicated the time limit for requesting a hearing and the consequences of failure to make a timely request.

        North Dakota Department of Transportation violated plaintiff driver’s right to due process at a license suspension hearing when it took the arresting officer’s testimony telephonically under N.D.C.C. § 28-32-35 without providing notice to plaintiff; the dangers of telephonic testimony were evident, as the hearing officer could not see the police officer to judge his demeanor or determine if he was testifying from notes. The officer was also unable to diagram the roadway where the stop occurred or demonstrate how he conducted the field sobriety test; N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05 demonstrated that the legislature intended for the Department to conduct in-person hearings, and the Department could not unilaterally determine hearings would be conducted telephonically.

        Administrative hearing on the suspension of a driver's license was not improper when the driver's counsel could not personally appear because (1) the hearing was held on the last day N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05(1) allowed, (2) counsel refused to arrange other counsel and instead appeared telephonically before being disconnected, (3) N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05 did not require counsel's in-person representation, and (4) the driver did not show continuing the hearing after counsel was disconnected violated due process.

        Defendant’s argument that a blood test should have been excluded from evidence because the nurse used “Acu-Dyne” as a skin disinfectant, and that there was no proof that such a disinfectant was nonalcoholic and nonvolatile as the instruction on the checklist required, was completely meritless where an exhibit in the record was a copy of a certified copy of a memorandum from the state toxicologist’s office stating that “Acu-Dyne” was a nonalcoholic, nonvolatile skin disinfectant and where the memorandum informed emergency room supervisors that “Acu-Dyne” should be used for cleansing skin prior to withdrawing blood from a DUI suspect.

        Drivers' licenses were properly suspended because, assuming consents to warrantless blood tests were involuntary, the exclusionary rule did not apply to administrative license suspension proceedings, given (1) a legislative purpose to gather reliable evidence of intoxication or nonintoxication, (2) a legislative direction to admit evidence of results of fairly administered chemical tests, (3) prior holdings that an affirmative refusal was necessary to withdraw an implied consent to take a test, (4) the role of such proceedings in protecting the public, and (5) U.S. Supreme Court rulings that the government's use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment did not itself violate the Constitution, since a Fourth Amendment violation was fully accomplished by an illegal search or seizure, and no exclusion of evidence could cure the invasion of a defendant's rights.

        Subsection (4) of this section does not designate who must certify the copy of the checklist and test results; it has long been the law in this state that an official record may be proved by the original or by a copy certified by the legal keeper thereof; certification by the custodian of a public record is sufficient.

       <p>
        The requirement that the copy be received by the commissioner “from a certified breath test operator” refers to the qualifications of the operator who administers the test; the requirement does not refer to who certifies the copy. This construction harmonizes with the requirements of N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07(5) because the results of the test would not be admissible under that section if the operator was not certified. Frost v.

        In a case involving a license suspension based on a driving under the influence (DUI) case, there was no violation of a licensee’s rights under the Fourth Amendment or N.D. Const. Art. I, § 8; regardless of whether an officer’s initial encounter with the licensee in his front yard constituted a seizure, the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the licensee to investigate a citizen’s complaint regarding erratic driving based partially on the specific description of the car and the fact that the citizen followed the car and waited until police arrived. Further, the officer had probable cause to arrest the licensee for DUI where the licensee failed sobriety tests, had bloodshot and glassy eyes, and admitted to drinking.

        Suspension of the licensee’s driving privileges for 180 days for DUI was appropriate under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05(2) because the officer had probable cause to arrest since witnesses described the vehicle involved in the accident; it was registered to the licensee; and the officer found the licensee extremely intoxicated.

        Suspension of driving privileges was proper, because N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05(3) by its terms specifically excluded from consideration at the administrative hearing whether the driver was informed of the consequences of refusal, and a reasoning mind could reasonably conclude that despite the driver’s verbal acquiescence to the chemical testing, the context in which the words were stated, his subsequent threats, and his refusal to cooperate with officers belied any intent to take the test and amounted to a refusal to do so.

        The operating procedure on the back side of an Alco-Sensor device is merely an additional approved method that warrants consideration of Alco-Sensor test results. Thus, the operating procedure on the back side of an Alco-Sensor device is irrelevant in a case in which the law enforcement officer’s testimony shows that in administering an Alco-Sensor test, he followed the approved method prescribed by the state toxicologist.

        Where officer’s testimony established that he performed the Alco-Sensor test according to the method approved by the state toxicologist, the hearing officer did not err in considering the results of the Alco-Sensor test in determining whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant had been driving a vehicle in violation of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-08s39-08-01" target="_self">39-08-01</a></cite>.

        The highway commissioner has a clear legal duty to grant a hearing on license suspension for driving under the influence of alcohol under the provisions of N.D.C.C. § 32-34-01, and a writ of mandamus may be properly issued to compel such action in accordance with N.D.C.C. § 39-20-05, but the duty is contingent on the action taken by the driver; before the commissioner’s duty to order a hearing arises, the driver must have timely requested a hearing.

        Driver’s license was not suspended according to law because, when the driver did not timely request an administrative hearing, it was error for a hearing officer to conclude the Department of Transportation had no jurisdiction, as the issue was whether that jurisdiction was properly invoked, which it was not, so the license could only be administratively revoked, and it was error to conduct a hearing.

        Mailing of the hearing officer’s decision to the driver three days after the administrative hearing did not deprive the North Dakota Department of Transportation of authority to suspend the driver’s driving privileges, because the statutory provision requiring the decision to be “immediately delivered” was not basic and mandatory, and the hearing officer’s action did not prejudice the driver.

        Letters containing a motorist’s request for “first of all a reopening of the administrative hearing…as a second choice an appeal to the District Court or whatever” did not constitute a request for an appeal when the hearing officer concluded that the motorist wanted a reconsideration of his license suspension under N.D.C.C. § 28-32-40(1); the hearing officer sent the motorist directions to participate in reconsideration and the motorist pursued reconsideration using those directions.

Rounkles v. Levi, 2015 ND 128, 863 N.W.2d 910, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2015), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 136 S. Ct. 2539, 195 L. Ed. 2d 868, 2016 U.S. LEXIS 4285 (U.S. 2016).

       <p>
        District court erred in reversing an administrative hearing officer’s decision to admit an exhibit containing breath test results based on an incomplete implied consent advisory where the driver neither objected to the officer’s failure to read the “or urine” portion of the implied advisory nor identified the issue in his specification of errors. Ouradnik v. Henke, 2020 ND 39, 938 N.W.2d 392, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether an exhibit containing the breath test results lacked proper authentication was preserved as the driver had made the argument below and included the issue within his specification of errors. Ouradnik v. Henke, 2020 ND 39, 938 N.W.2d 392, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Specification of error was insufficient to preserve the issue of a substantive omission from the statutory implied consent advisory for review where it did not state what added or omitted language or substantive change caused the advisory to be deficient, but was simply boilerplate. Grove v. DOT, 2020 ND 146, 945 N.W.2d 257, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       <p>
        Failure to furnish a complete administrative hearing transcript usually results in a remand until the transcript can be provided, not a dismissal of the action. Rudolph v. North Dakota DOT Director, 539 N.W.2d 63, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Case law did not require automatic summary dismissal of a decision suspending a driver’s license when the North Dakota Department of Transportation failed to file a transcript within the 20-day period pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 39-20-06 as the filing period was not jurisdictional; because the driver failed to allege or prove prejudice caused by the two-day delay in filing the transcript, the department’s failure to file the transcript within 20 days did not mandate reversal of the decision suspending the driver’s license.
   May v. Sprynczynatyk, 2005 ND 76, 695 N.W.2d 196, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the North Dakota Department of Transportation’s actual receipt of a notice of appeal which commences the 20-day period, rather than some other event such as service or filing the notice of appeal. Therefore, the filing of a transcript shortly after receiving a facsimile of a notice of appeal was timely since the date of filing the appeal was not dispositive.
   Sayler v. N.D. DOT, 2007 ND 165, 740 N.W.2d 94, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affirmation of an order suspending the driver’s driving privileges for 180 days was improper because the Department of Transportation failed to transmit a record compiled in the administrative proceedings. Although the hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in setting the hearing date, the Department failed to certify a record on appeal to the district court, and there was no record on appeal establishing the Department’s authority to suspend the driver’s driving privileges.
   Baesler v. N.D. DOT, 2012 ND 39, 812 N.W.2d 434, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 31</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case involving the suspension of driving privileges, a district court erred by summarily reversing a hearing officer's decision due to the North Dakota Department of Transportation's failure to file a transcript within the statutory time frame because there was no prejudice or systematic disregard of the law. This was only the second instance since 2005 when the record of an administrative hearing was kept and the Department failed to timely submit the transcript; moreover, the transcript was filed with the district court prior to the review date and prior to the matter being noticed for a hearing. Bayles v. N.D. DOT, 2015 ND 298, 872 N.W.2d 626, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 315</cite> (N.D. 2015).

     <p>
      Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any individual while driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or a combination thereof, evidence of the amount of alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or a combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, or urine at the time of the act alleged as shown by a chemical analysis of the blood, breath, or urine is admissible. For the purpose of this section:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-07ol11">
       An individual having, at that time, an alcohol concentration of not more than five one-hundredths of one percent by weight is presumed not to be under the influence of intoxicating liquor. This presumption has no application to the administration of chapter 39-06.2.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-07ol12">
       Evidence that there was at that time more than five one-hundredths of one percent by weight alcohol concentration in an individual is relevant evidence, but it is not to be given prima facie effect in indicating whether the individual was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-07ol13">
       An individual having an alcohol concentration of at least eight one-hundredths of one percent by weight or, with respect to an individual under twenty-one years of age, an alcohol concentration of at least two one-hundredths of one percent by weight at the time of the performance of a chemical test within two hours after driving or being in physical control of a vehicle is under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of driving or being in physical control of a vehicle.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-07ol14">
       Alcohol concentration is based upon grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of end expiratory breath or grams of alcohol per sixty-seven milliliters of urine.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-07ol15">
       The results of the chemical analysis must be received in evidence when it is shown that the sample was properly obtained and the test was fairly administered, and if the test is shown to have been performed according to methods and with devices approved by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee, and by an individual possessing a certificate of qualification to administer the test issued by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee. The director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee is authorized to approve satisfactory devices and methods of chemical analysis and determine the qualifications of individuals to conduct such analysis, and shall issue a certificate to all qualified operators who exhibit the certificate upon demand of the individual requested to take the chemical test.

       The director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee may appoint, train, certify, and supervise field inspectors of breath testing equipment and its operation, and the inspectors shall report the findings of any inspection to the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee for appropriate action. Upon approval of the methods or devices, or both, required to perform the tests and the individuals qualified to administer them, the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee shall prepare, certify, and electronically post a written record of the approval with the state crime laboratory division of the attorney general at the attorney general website, and shall include in the record:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t39c39-20s39-20-07ol16a">

        This section confers on a defendant, cost free, the right to subpoena as a witness the person who conducted the chemical analysis. It does not, however, relieve the defendant from exercising that right in accordance with rule and statute. Nor is it the source of any freestanding right to have the analyst present at trial that is independent of the constitutional right of compulsory process. State v. Ganje, 481 N.W.2d 227, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (9) provides only that a defendant, at no cost, may subpoena the chemical analyst, but the statute does not give the defendant an absolute right to have the analyst present at trial. Instead, defendant had the duty of assuring analyst’s appearance by serving “timely” the subpoena and moving for continuance if analyst could not testify. State v. Ganje, 481 N.W.2d 227, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although ordinarily under subdivision (9) the defendant is entitled to have the analyst present at trial, it did not follow that the analyst’s unavailability, through no fault of the state, justified dismissal under either this section or the Sixth Amendment, where there was nothing in the record to establish that the analyst would not attend trial on another day. State v. Ganje, 481 N.W.2d 227, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (9) of this section gives the defendant the right to have the chemist who conducted chemical analysis testify at trial when properly summoned; when the chemist is unlocatable and thus truly unavailable to testify, suppression of the test results is justified. State v. Zink, 519 N.W.2d 581, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        The surprise admission of a form from toxicologist, after a mid-trial facsimile certification, created an unforeseen need for defendant’s counsel to have the opportunity to cross-examine the chemist who analyzed the blood sample in order to challenge the scientific reliability of the blood test; therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a continuance.

       <p>
        Exclusion of the forensic analyst’s testimony based on defendant’s acquiescence to admission of the chemical test results was contrary to N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07 and the refusal to allow the analyst to testify was unreasonable and warranted a new trial.
   While defendant admitted to drinking and smelled of alcohol, there was little evidence indicating that he was under the influence of intoxicating liquor and thus, exclusion of the testimony was not harmless.
   State v. Schwab, 2008 ND 94, 748 N.W.2d 696, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 2008).

        Drivers' licenses were properly suspended because, assuming consents to warrantless blood tests were involuntary, the exclusionary rule did not apply to administrative license suspension proceedings, given (1) a legislative purpose to gather reliable evidence of intoxication or nonintoxication, (2) a legislative direction to admit evidence of results of fairly administered chemical tests, (3) prior holdings that an affirmative refusal was necessary to withdraw an implied consent to take a test, (4) the role of such proceedings in protecting the public, and (5) U.S. Supreme Court rulings that the government's use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment did not itself violate the Constitution, since a Fourth Amendment violation was fully accomplished by an illegal search or seizure, and no exclusion of evidence could cure the invasion of a defendant's rights.

        Officer’s testimony established he performed Form 104’s required steps and showed scrupulous compliance with the approved method and the evidence of the blood test was admissible; while the officer’s testimony was adequate to show compliance, the form itself stated to “tear along the perforation and retain for your records,” and a properly completed Form 104 checklist entered into evidence was prima facie evidence of fair administration, chain of custody, and compliance.

        District court properly affirmed an administrative hearing officer’s decision to suspend defendant’s driving privileges for 180 days for driving under the influence of alcohol because an Intoxilyzer test record and checklist were the necessary and sufficient means to render test results admissible without further foundation, the documentary evidence and the officer’s testimony showed scrupulous compliance with the methods approved by the State Toxicologist, the officer ascertained the 20-minute waiting period, and defendant failed to rebut by presenting evidence that anything was in his mouth during the waiting period.

        Police officer’s conclusory testimony was insufficient to establish that the driver’s blood test sample had been properly obtained, and was therefore insufficient to establish the test was fairly administered according to the State Toxicologist’s approved methods, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-07" target="_self">39-20-07</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that the State established that the police officer scrupulously complied with the 20-minute waiting period, required before administering an Intoxilyzer test, as, although defendant testified at trial, he did not testify that he had, in fact, put any chewing tobacco, which he had in his pocket, in his mouth before the test or during the periods that he was left unattended in the squad car. The officer’s testimony that he ascertained the 20-minute waiting period and that defendant did not have anything in his mouth prior to the test left the inference to be drawn by the trial court; thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s N.D.R.Crim.P. 29 motions.

       <p>
        District court properly affirmed a decision by the Department of Transportation suspending defendant's driving privileges for 91 days because the hearing officer did not abuse her discretion in admitting the results of defendant's blood test or the foundational documents where the documents introduced into evidence and certified by the director of the state crime laboratory and a trooper's testimony established that defendant's blood sample was properly obtained, the blood test was fairly administered, an approved method was used, and the test was performed by an authorized person.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because a police officer deviated from the approved method to conduct breath tests which may have affected the scientific accuracy or reliability of the test, and there was no expert testimony on the effect, if any, of the deviation, the Department of Transportation failed to show that the test was fairly administered under
   N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07(5). Therefore, the hearing officer should not have admitted appellant's Intoxilyzer test record into evidence.

       <p>
        In a driving under the influence case, blood test results were not inadmissible because normal evidentiary procedures could have been used, rather than the statutory method of blood test authentication under the short cut statute. The State provided sufficient evidence to authenticate the results where the district court heard testimony from every individual involved in the administration of defendant's blood test.

        Hearing officer did not act arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously admitting an Intoxilyzer report into evidence where the designee of the state crime laboratory director had the proper authorization to act as the designee, and his memo, along with the testimony of the officer administering the test and the chemical test operator, laid a proper foundation for admitting the report.

        Sufficient foundation was established to admit a blood sample analysis at an administrative hearing on suspending a driver's driving privileges because (1) the report was properly certified by a forensic scientist who identified the scientist as a designee of the Director of the North Dakota Office of Attorney General, Crime Laboratory Division and stated the report was a true and correct copy of the original on electronic file at the Attorney General's office, (2) the report bore the seal of the North Dakota Office of Attorney General, Crime Laboratory Division, and (3) the scientist was identified on the “List of Individuals Certified to Conduct Blood Alcohol Analysis,” so the report was self-authenticating under N.D. R. Evid. 902(10), and (4) the driver presented nothing contested the report's presumed authenticity.

        While it is not necessary for the state to call all persons who have handled the blood sample in order to introduce the test results, it is incumbent upon the state to show that the sample tested is the same one originally drawn from the defendant; because the state failed to prove that the blood sample tested was the same one drawn from the defendant, the trial court erred in admitting the blood-alcohol test result as evidence.

        Compliance with Form 104 adequately demonstrates the connection between the taking of the blood sample and its receipt at the state toxicologist’s office, to establish the chain of custody. State v. Jordheim, 508 N.W.2d 878, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1993).

       <p>
        Suspension of the driving privileges of a driver was affirmed because the testimony information on the top portion of Form 104 and the testimony of the two arresting police officers regarding the handling of the blood sample was sufficient to clear up any chain of custody concerns regarding the blood sample as required pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-07" target="_self">39-20-07</a></cite>. The officers testified that they followed the required procedures, that the mix-up in the dates was due to poor handwriting, and that the driver’s blood sample was the only sample that they handled on the days at issue.

        A blood test showing a result more than 0.05 percent is relevant evidence on whether the person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor, even without any presumptive effect due to the fact that it was not performed within two hours of arrest.

        In a prosecution for driving under the influence, it was for the court to make the preliminary determination of whether a blood test allegedly taken more than two hours after arrest was properly obtained and fairly administered for statutory admissibility. It was for the jury to assess its relevancy and weight. State v. Vetsch, 368 N.W.2d 547, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 325</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        Evidence sufficient to support a finding that blood test was performed within two hours, and evidence to the contrary in defendant’s testimony, went to the use and weight to be given to the test report, not its reliability. Therefore, it was proper for the trial court to admit the test report to permit the jury to determine whether the test was obtained within two hours and to properly assess its weight. State v.

        The state did not show that test was administered in accordance with the state toxicologist’s established methods and procedures for blood sample collection and submission, where the state attempted to prove compliance with the approved methods and to meet its burden of establishing fair administration of the test by introducing testimony of the arresting officer, but the officer’s testimony did not establish that he performed each and every step of the test in accordance with the detailed procedures promulgated by the state toxicologist, and no other evidence was provided by the state regarding compliance with the state toxicologist’s directives for blood sample collection and submission.

        Blood sample test results are admissible under this section only after the proponent establishes fair administration of the test.

        Where the administering officer deviated from the state toxicologist’s approved method to conduct a breath test with an intoxilyzer and there was no expert testimony on the effect, if any, of the deviation on the accuracy and reliability of the intoxilyzer test result, the hearing officer should not have admitted the intoxilyzer test result into evidence.

        Reliability and accuracy of the results are established by demonstrating compliance with the methods adopted by the state toxicologist.

        North Dakota State Toxicologist’s approved method for administering an Intoxilyzer test provides that before proceeding, the operator must ascertain that the subject has had nothing to eat, drink, or smoke within twenty minutes prior to the collection of the breath sample; scrupulous compliance does not mean hypertechnical compliance, and observation of a defendant is not the exclusive method of ascertaining whether the 20-minute requirement in the administration of an Intoxilyzer test has been met.

Because scrupulous, but not hypertechnical, compliance was required in administering an Intoxilyzer test under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07(5), and because a fact-finder could draw reasonable inferences from the facts, a district court erred in concluding that the Department of Transportation failed to establish that it fairly administered the test to the licensee.

After the nurse completed the blood draw, she and the officer recorded their actions on Form 104 and mailed the kit to the state crime lab for analysis; because the officer’s handling of the kit complied with N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07(5), (10), defendant’s blood alcohol sample showing a concentration of .13 percent was properly admitted into evidence.

        The legislative assembly, by its use of the term “devices” in subdivision (5) of this section, did not intend to expand the certification and approval requirements of the state toxicologist to include auxiliary equipment that might be used in conjunction with a specific testing device, but merely recognized the need for a method of approving new testing equipment as it became available for use.

        Where driver ignored officer’s request to rinse his mouth with water to clear his mouth of tobacco on two occasions, driver in effect refused to take breath test and could not challenge foundation (compliance with approved methods) for admissibility of test results. Bryl v. Backes, 477 N.W.2d 809, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 197</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        A person cannot intentionally retain a substance in his or her mouth after being requested to dispose of it, and then claim that the intoxilyzer test results are inaccurate based upon failure to comply with the approved methods. In such a case, a defendant cannot challenge the foundation for the admission of the test results established by following the approved methods. State v. Bryl, 477 N.W.2d 814, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Driver was barred from challenging the admissibility of the driver’s Intoxilyzer test results, where the driver failed to reveal to the officer administering the test that the driver had chewing tobacco in his mouth during the test.

        Where the commissioner produced in evidence a certified copy of the “Standard Solution Analytical Report,” wherein the state toxicologist certified solution No. 261 as being an approved standard solution for testing if it produced a reading in the range of 0.100 percent to 0.119 percent during the standard solution test phase, and also produced a certified copy of the “Breathalyzer Operational Check List” used by the officer in administering the breath test, which document showed that standard solution No. 261 was used and that the standard test reading was .11, the evidence presented by the commissioner clearly demonstrated that the standard solution used during appellee’s breathalyzer test was adequate for producing accurate and valid test results. Pladson v. Hjelle, 368 N.W.2d 508, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 317</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        After the commissioner introduced certified copies relating to the administration of appellee’s test, the fairness and accuracy of the test was prima facie shown. If appellee wished to discredit the test results with evidence that the standard solution was stale, it was his responsibility to produce such evidence at that time. Pladson v. Hjelle, 368 N.W.2d 508, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 317</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting intoxilyzer test results as there was no requirement in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07 or the North Dakota State Toxicologist’s approved method that a standard solution be used for only 50 tests; whether more than 50 tests were conducted with the solution used for defendant’s test affected the weight, not the admissibility, of the test results.

       <p>
        In defendant’s criminal prosecution for driving under the influence of alcohol, the district court did not err in admitting Form 104 or the deputy state toxicologist’s certification, because those evidentiary documents laid a foundation for the admission of defendant’s chemical analysis and did not attempt to directly prove an element of the charged offense. Defendant’s right to confrontation was not violated by the State’s failure to call the nurse to testify, because the arresting officer and the forensic scientist who tested the blood sample both testified and were cross-examined.

        Where a defendant was convicted of driving under the influence, the district court did not err by admitting an analytical report containing the results of her blood test without producing the forensic scientist who peer reviewed the analytical report since report was not testimonial and the State was not required to produce him under N.D.R.Ev. 707 and the Confrontation Clause.

        City was entitled to a supervisory writ directing the district court to vacate a pretrial order requiring the city to produce at trial the individual who initially inspected and reviewed the installation of the testing device used to administer a chemical breath test to defendant because the city lacked another adequate remedy, the individual did not make any testimonial statements requiring the city to produce her at trial, there was no statutory language that would require the individual to make testimonial statements, and her statements were more appropriately categorized as foundational, concerning chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, as opposed to testimonial.

        Testimony of state toxicologist, or in his absence, certified copies of records relating to approval of method and devices used in administering test for intoxication is necessary to lay foundation for introduction of Breathalyzer results. State v. Fuchs, 219 N.W.2d 842, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        A showing that the test was “fairly administered” is required to establish foundation for admissibility of a Breathalyzer test and full proof that the device was in proper working order, that the chemicals used were proper and properly compounded, that the operator was qualified, and that the test was given correctly are required. State v. Salhus, 220 N.W.2d 852, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 1974); State v. Ghylin, 222 N.W.2d 864, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundational requirements needed to show that a breathalyzer test was fairly administered, and that the results are therefore admissible, may be met by testimony of the state toxicologist; the testimony of the state toxicologist, if he testifies, takes precedence over the approved methods placed on file with the district courts. State v. Puhr, 316 N.W.2d 75, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because this section permits admission of evidence without expert witness testimony to establish accuracy and reliability, all the requirements of this section must be scrupulously met to ensure a uniform basis of testing throughout the state and fair administration. Moser v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 369 N.W.2d 650, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 337</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundational requirements needed to show that a breathalyzer test was fairly administered so as to render the results admissible may be met either through testimony of the state toxicologist or through the introduction of certified copies of approved methods and techniques filed by the state toxicologist with the clerk of the district court pursuant to this section. Moser v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 369 N.W.2d 650, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 337</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fair administration of an intoxilyzer test may be established in either of two ways: through the state toxicologist’s testimony, or by a showing that the test was performed according to the state toxicologist’s approved method of administering the test. Schirado v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 382 N.W.2d 391, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 264</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, certified copies of the operational checklist and records showing that the device was approved and that the operator was qualified are admissible to prove fair administration of the test, and even if the requirements of this section are not met, chemical test results can be used as evidence if the proponent supplies other proof that the test was fairly administered. Brandt v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 409 N.W.2d 645, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 374</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a checklist, the test results may not be introduced into evidence without some other showing of fair administration. Salter v. Hjelle, 415 N.W.2d 801, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 438</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court has applied a presumption of regularity to official acts of the state toxicologist, but has never applied this presumption to testing officers. To do so would effectively eliminate the requirement that the commissioner prove fair administration. Salter v. Hjelle, 415 N.W.2d 801, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 438</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        A certified copy of blood test results is admissible pursuant to subsections (8) and (10) only if fair administration of the test has been established in accordance with subsection (5). State v. Schwalk, 430 N.W.2d 317, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fair administration of the blood test can only be shown by: (a) proof of compliance with the state toxicologist’s directions which go to the scientific accuracy of the test, or (b) through expert testimony. Kummer v. Backes, 486 N.W.2d 252, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute does not require testimony of the state toxicologist or of the intoxilyzer operator to show fair administration of the test; rather, the purpose of this section is to ease the requirements for admissibility of chemical test results while ensuring that the test upon which the results are based is fairly administered. Frost v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 487 N.W.2d 6, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Documents, including certified copies of the operational checklist, of the approved methods filed by the state toxicologist with the clerk of district court, and of records showing that the device was approved and that the operator was qualified, are admissible to prove fair administration of the test; the statutory scheme authorizes the use of documentary evidence to expedite and simplify the procedure. Frost v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 487 N.W.2d 6, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A chemical test is fairly administered if the operator complies with the approved method of the state toxicologist; compliance with the approved method can be proved by properly completed and certified documents alone, testimony showing that the testing officer performed every step in the approved method, or proof that the missing steps do not significantly affect the test results. Hettich v. Moore, 514 N.W.2d 378, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The results of a blood-alcohol test must be admitted into evidence in an alcohol-related proceeding if the test was fairly administered according to the toxicologist’s approved procedures. State v. Zimmerman, 516 N.W.2d 638, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a defendant rebuts the prosecution’s prima facie showing of fair administration of a blood-alcohol test for admission under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07(5), the prosecution may present testimony to show fair administration despite the defendant’s rebuttal.

        Although officer who administered the breathalyzer test did not comply with the approved methods to conduct such test filed with the district court, the test was “fairly administered” and its results admissible where the state toxicologist testified that each of the individual mistakes in administering the test had an insignificant effect on the result and that, considering everything that went wrong, the indicated result could be less by .01 percent.

        Blood test results were properly admitted where “other evidence” was offered by the director of transportation to prove fair administration of the blood test; the arresting officer testified that each and every one of the nine steps on the checklist was followed, and his testimony provided the necessary proof to show that the approved methods for conducting the blood test were “scrupulously” met, even though there was no certified copy of the blood test checklist.

Based on the officer’s testimony that appellee was arrested and his mouth was cleared at 1.00 a.m. and the the Intoxilyzer test was administered at 1:25 a.m., a reasonable person could infer the twenty-minute wait period was observed.

        Jury instruction stating that the presumption of subsection 3 of this section “serves as evidence and governs you in finding the facts unless it is disproved by evidence or if, from the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the presumed fact” was not erroneous; taken by itself, the first clause of the instruction would have been improper, but modified by the second clause it sufficiently indicated that presumptive evidence might be accepted or rejected by the jury as they saw fit, and that defendant’s failure to disprove the presumption did not ease the state’s burden of proof. State v. Hendrickson, 240 N.W.2d 846, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 1976).

        While supreme court stated it would be advisable for trial court to give a jury instruction regarding the words “presumption” or “presumed” to the effect that they are rebuttable presumptions, failure of trial court to give jury instruction that result of the breathalyzer test was a rebuttable presumption did not constitute error where the instructions given the jury, as a whole, were not erroneous and correctly and adequately apprised the jury of the law relative to driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor including the meaning of the phrase “under the influence of intoxicating liquor”, that the state had the burden to prove each and every one of the allegations of the complaint beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the defendant is presumed innocent until his guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Hepper, 316 N.W.2d 338, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 1982), overruled in part, State v. Himmerick, 499 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Certified copy of the analytical report signed by the state toxicologist is prima facie evidence of the results of the chemical analysis of the sample and it can be assumed, when there is no evidence to the contrary, that the chemical analysis was performed according to the law.

       <p>
        Where analytical report indicated defendant’s blood sample contained alcohol in the concentration of .11 percent “by weight”, but did not state that the analysis was based upon “grams of alcohol per one hundred cubic centimeters of blood”, there was a rebuttable presumption that the result of the analysis was based upon “grams of alcohol per one hundred cubic centimeters of blood”, and the analytical report was admissible where no contradictory evidence was introduced to rebut the presumption.

       <p>
        Pursuant to this statutory scheme, the state toxicologist drafted Form 104 to be used when a blood sample is drawn for blood alcohol testing, and fair administration of the test may be established only through proof that the Form 104 methods for collection and preservation of the blood sample were scrupulously complied with or through expert testimony establishing the scientific accuracy of the test.

       <p>
        Form 104, used when a blood sample is drawn for alcohol testing, could be improved with the inclusion of a provision wherein the specimen collector certifies that he or she followed the directions and placed the properly drawn and sealed container in the regular mailing process, since absent such a written certification Form 104 does not on its face establish fair administration of the test, and the state must therefore do so by other evidence.

        The trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial where admission of an uncertified Form 104 was not shown to constitute any prejudice to the defendant; the state produced evidence that the blood test had been fairly administered and although the admitted Form 104 was not certified, the arresting officer testified that it came for the “cardboard vial” as part of the blood sample kit. There was no evidence, not even an allegation, that the form was inaccurate or contained something other than the state toxicologist’s directions for blood testing. State v.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the State’s Form 104 where, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07, defendant’s blood test was collected following the proper procedures set forth by the state toxicologist; the police officer’s testimony showed that defendant’s blood was properly obtained, and laid the foundation for the admission of Form 104. The testimony of the nurse who drew the blood from defendant was not necessary for admission of the form since the police officer observed the blood draw process and was available for cross-examination and the forensic scientist testified that the sample was properly preserved and was also available for cross-examination.

        Reviewing court overruled defendant’s assertion that the results of his blood-alcohol test were erroneously admitted in evidence since the approved procedures were not followed in obtaining the blood-alcohol test, because the testimony established the blood was properly obtained and laid the foundation for admission of Form 104; the blood specimen collector testified that his failure to check the box on Form 104 was an “oversight” and to his best recollection he did invert the tube several times after taking the blood sample because “in every blood draw we invert the tubes,” and the toxicologist testified the failure to include the time on the tube in addition to the Form 104 would not affect the results of the analysis.

        Deputy’s detailed testimony of the steps he undertook to properly administer defendant’s blood test reflected the trial court’s conclusion that the scientific reliability or accuracy of the test was not compromised by the deputy’s failure to put his name on the Form 104.

        A certificate signed by the state toxicologist qualifying a police officer to administer Breathalyzer tests and certifying that the device meets the requirements of this section was not admissible where there was no compliance with requirements for authentication of the certificate. State v. Salhus, 220 N.W.2d 852, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 1974); State v. Ghylin, 222 N.W.2d 864, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1974).

        The legislative assembly intended to allow the state toxicologist to delegate authority to run the blood tests, and his certification of the copy of a report is sufficient to comply with subdivision 8 of this section.

        The requirement that the copy be received by the commissioner “from a certified breath test operator” refers to the qualifications of the operator who administers the test; the requirement does not refer to who certifies the copy; the results of the test would not be admissible under this section if the operator was not certified.

        In a criminal DUI case, the trial court properly admitted evidence of defendant’s refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test pursuant to this section, because the section explicitly permits evidence of a defendant’s refusal to submit to a blood alcohol test in either a civil or criminal action or proceeding which arises out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving while under the influence.

        A driver has only a conditional right to refuse a chemical test; among the conditions imposed upon the exercise of one’s right to refuse a chemical test are the revocation of the person’s license or permit to drive or vehicle and the admission in evidence of proof of refusal in civil or criminal actions.

     <p>
      In cases of death resulting from a motor vehicle accident or other unnatural death occurring in a motor vehicle, the county coroner shall require that specimens of blood, urine, and vitreous humor be withdrawn from the body of the decedent within twenty-four hours after the decedent’s death by a coroner, coroner’s physician, or other qualified person, prior to embalming. The specimens must be collected and preserved by methods and techniques established by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee. The specimens so drawn must be sent to the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee for analysis for alcohol, carbon monoxide, and other drug content. The director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee shall keep a record of all such examinations to be used for statistical purposes. The records must be made available to the director for use by the national highway traffic safety administration in analyzing fatal accidents. The information in the possession of the director may be obtained from the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee only as provided in this section. Except as provided, the results of the examinations referred to in this section must be used only for statistical purposes, except that the results must be released upon the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum by a court of competent jurisdiction in any civil or criminal action. The cumulative results of the examinations, without identifying the individuals involved, must be disseminated to interested state and local officials and made public by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee. Any person drawing the specimens and any person making any examination under the terms of this section are immune from all liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred or imposed.

       Any individual who operates a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this state is deemed to have given consent to submit to an onsite screening test or tests of the individual’s breath for the purpose of estimating the alcohol concentration in the individual’s breath upon the request of a law enforcement officer who has reason to believe that the individual committed a moving traffic violation or a violation under section 39-08-01 or an equivalent offense, or was involved in a traffic accident as a driver, and in conjunction with the violation or the accident the officer has, through the officer’s observations, formulated an opinion that the individual’s body contains alcohol.

The results of such screening test must be used only for determining whether or not a further test shall be given under the provisions of section 39-20-01. The officer shall inform the individual that North Dakota law requires the individual to take the screening test to determine whether the individual is under the influence of alcohol and that refusal of the individual to submit to a screening test may result in a revocation for at least one hundred eighty days and up to three years of that individual’s driving privileges. If such individual refuses to submit to such screening test or tests, none may be given, but such refusal is admissible in a court proceeding if the individual was arrested in violation of section 39-08-01 and did not take any additional chemical tests requested by the law enforcement officer. Such refusal is sufficient cause to revoke such individual’s license or permit to drive in the same manner as provided in section 39-20-04, and a hearing as provided in section 39-20-05 and a judicial review as provided in section 39-20-06 must be available.

        Admission of the alcohol level evaluation roadside tester chemical screening test evidence is precluded by this section when probable cause for arresting the defendant is not an issue at trial. State v. Schimmel, 409 N.W.2d 335, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        If probable cause to arrest is not at issue at trial, the result of the Alcohol Level Evaluation Roadside Tester (A.L.E.R.T.) test is inadmissible. City of Fargo v. Ruether, 490 N.W.2d 481, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant conceded the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest him for driving under the influence, evidence that the defendant consented to take the A.L.E.R.T. test and a breath test was irrelevant and inadmissible. City of Fargo v. Erickson, 1999 ND 145, 598 N.W.2d 787, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 165</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Implied consent statute, N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14, was not coercive in the context of pre-arrest onsite screening tests as there was no logical difference between being advised of the consequences of refusal of a pre-arrest onsite screening test and a post-arrest chemical test in terms of determining voluntariness of consent. State v. Nagel, 2014 ND 224, 857 N.W.2d 374, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the results of the pre-arrest onsite screening test where sufficient competent evidence supported the decision that defendant voluntarily consented to the test. State v. Nagel, 2014 ND 224, 857 N.W.2d 374, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not coerced to take a pre-arrest onsite screening test by the implied consent advisory where case law recognized that a driver could change his mind, and there was no dispute that defendant eventually agreed to take the onsite screening test, thereby curing his prior refusal. State v. Nagel, 2014 ND 224, 857 N.W.2d 374, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial after the admission of the preliminary breath test because the disclosure of the preliminary breath test result violated the legislative directive contained in the statute at issue where the trial did not include a challenge of probable cause to arrest, there was no admission against interest exception to the hearsay rule in the statute, the result was inadmissible regardless of who stated or offered the result, and the disclosure of the test result was admitted through the video of the traffic stop, the implication that defendant had failed the test through the questioning of the arresting officer, and the jury's specific question regarding the preliminary breath test. State v. Rende, 2018 ND 33, 905 N.W.2d 909, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 2018).

This language requires an affirmative refusal to take the test. State v. Solberg, 381 N.W.2d 197, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        There is no provision in this section that an officer requesting the on-site screening test must be certified to administer the test; this section only requires that the officer administering the test must be certified. Therefore, revocation of a driver’s license for 1 year was appropriate for a refusal because an argument that an officer who was not certified as a chemical test operator was unauthorized to request that the driver submit to such was rejected. YellowBird v. N.D. DOT, 2013 ND 131, 833 N.W.2d 536, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        All of the subsections are unambiguously referring to the same test, regardless of whether it is referred to as an onsite screening test as provided in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14(1) or the six subsequent references to just screening test in the following subsections; § 39-20-14(2) is not written as an exception to screening tests only being allowed at the location of the traffic stop, but places limitations on screening tests at a particular location away from the location of the stop. Schulke v. Panos, 2020 ND 53, 940 N.W.2d 303, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court can reconcile N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14(1) and (2) by interpreting § 39-20-14(1) as establishing that drivers are deemed to have provided consent to submit to a screening test when the driver commits a traffic offense or is involved in an accident and, in conjunction with the traffic violation or accident, law enforcement formulates an opinion the driver’s body contains alcohol. In order to give effect to § 39-20-14(2), the court cannot interpret § 39-20-14(1) as requiring the screening test to be conducted at the location of the stop. Schulke v. Panos, 2020 ND 53, 940 N.W.2d 303, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be inconsistent to hold the screening test in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14(3) is limited to the location of the traffic stop when the required advisory does not include any such limitation.

        Although
   N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14(4) provides an individual's driving privileges must not be revoked for refusing to submit to a screening test if the individual provides a sufficient breath, blood, or urine sample for a chemical test requested under
   N.D.C.C. § 39-20-01 for the same incident, there is no corresponding language that the driver must be so informed for purposes of the administrative revocation proceeding.

        In a trial for driving with a blood-alcohol concentration of at least .10%, the admission into evidence of an on-site chemical screening test was harmless error, where in light of two blood-alcohol tests presented to the jury, the prejudicial effect of the screening test was negligible. State v. Schimmel, 409 N.W.2d 335, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for refusal to submit to an onsite screening test. The jury could have reasonably inferred that the arresting officer, through his observations, formulated an opinion that defendant's body contained alcohol.

        Where defendant had odor of alcohol on his breath, had bloodshot eyes, stated that he had been drinking, and registered a “fail” on an Alco-Sensor test performed in accordance with the state toxicologist’s approved method, those facts were sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that an offense had been or was being committed, and the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that plaintiff had been driving a vehicle in violation of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-08s39-08-01" target="_self">39-08-01</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Where officer pulled defendant’s vehicle over because he suspected the driver was impaired after the vehicle swerved in its own lane, crossed the center line once, and nearly struck a curb, these circumstances provided a sufficient basis to create a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was violating the law; therefore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motions to dismiss and suppress subsequent breath test based upon the investigative stop. State v. Woytassek, 491 N.W.2d 709, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Erratic driving, combined with the indicia of intoxication, gave a deputy reason to believe defendant was driving while under the influence of liquor or drugs, and since the deputy formed this opinion prior to administering the Alco-Sensor test, he complied with this section.

        North Dakota Department of Transportation (DOT) erred by suspending appellant’s driving privileges, because the officer’s report and notice to the Director of the DOT was deficient under N.D.C.C. § 39-20-04 as the officer failed to indicate his belief that appellant’s body contained alcohol. The officer must first form the opinion that the person’s body contains alcohol before the implied consent provision applies under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t39c39-20s39-20-14" target="_self">39-20-14</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Law enforcement officer may request an onsite screening test of a driver's breath based on reasonable suspicion the driver was driving while impaired; a warrantless pre-arrest onsite screening test of an individual's breath implicates a similar lack of intrusiveness as a breath test incident to an arrest and serves the purpose of providing additional evidence about impairment before necessitating or negating the need for a subsequent arrest.
   Barrios-Flores v. Levi, 2017 ND 117, 894 N.W.2d 888, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 2017).

       <p>
        Statute requires reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence before a law enforcement officer may request a driver to submit to a pre-arrest warrantless onsite screening test of an individual's breath and a driver's license may be revoked for refusing a test based upon the officer's reasonable suspicion; a pre-arrest warrantless onsite screening test of an individual's breath based on reasonable suspicion the individual was driving while impaired does not violate the constitution.

        District court properly affirmed the Department of Transportation's suspension of a driver's driving privileges for 180 days because police officers did not have to inform the driver of his right to remedy his refusal to submit to a chemical test in order for the Department to suspend his license, the Department's report and notice form, which was admitted without an objection on hearsay grounds, provided sufficient evidence to support the police officer's request for an onsite screening test, all of the driver's constitutional claims had previously been rejected, and he failed to show how North Dakota's Constitution provided greater protection than the Fourth Amendment.

       <p>
        District court did not err in refusing to give defendant’s requested jury instruction under subsection (1) because he failed to raise the requirements for the initial traffic stop in an appropriate pretrial motion and thus, waived the issue; the failure to charge defendant with refusing to submit to an onsite screening test was irrelevant to the validity of the stop, which turned on whether the officer had an articulable and reasonable suspicion he was violating the law for failure to stop.

        Whether a driver declining to submit to a screening test that has been requested under unusual circumstances constitutes a refusal should remain a question of fact. Schulke v. Panos, 2020 ND 53, 940 N.W.2d 303, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        Appellee had already been placed under arrest for other crimes, had been transported to the correctional facility, and the arresting officer did not conduct his preliminary investigation of appellee’s potential alcohol violation at the location of the stop because of safety concerns; under the circumstances of this case, the factual finding that he refused the screening test at a location other than the location of the traffic stop was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

        Where both prerequisites to a police officer’s request that a defendant submit to an on-site screening test were found: a moving traffic violation by defendant, and the officer’s opinion, formulated through personal observation, that a defendant’s body contained alcohol, and where defendant refused to submit to other blood alcohol tests, revocation of defendant’s license was proper. Jorgenson v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 498 N.W.2d 167, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 48</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        Motorist’s refusal to submit to an onsite screening test pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 39-20-14 justified revocation of motorist’s license, as described in N.D.C.C. § 39-20-04(1)(a). Wetsch v. N.D. DOT, 2004 ND 93, 679 N.W.2d 282, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 2004).

       <p>
        Department of Transportation properly revoked a driver's driving privilege for refusal to submit to an onsite screening test of his breath because a law enforcement officer had a reasonable suspicion he was driving while impaired; the officer observed the driver's vehicle speeding and initiated a traffic stop, the driver had bloodshot watery eyes, and he admitted he had a couple of beers.

       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly affirmed the Department of Transportation’s revocation of a driver’s license for two years because the hearing officer had sufficient statutory grounds to do so where, but for the driver’s deliberate action in refusing to submit to an on-site screening test, a test would have been given and foundational documentation of the test’s compliance with approved methods would have been available.

        District court erred in reversing an ALJ’s decision revoking a licensee’s driving privileges for 180 days for refusal to take an onsite screening test because, even if defendant’s limited right to counsel was violated after his arrest, he had no right to counsel prior to arrest when he refused to take the test, and he did not properly cure his refusal.

        The operating procedure on the back side of an Alco-Sensor device is merely an additional approved method that warrants consideration of Alco-Sensor test results. Thus, the operating procedure on the back side of an Alco-Sensor device is irrelevant in a case in which the law enforcement officer’s testimony shows that in administering the Alco-Sensor test he followed the approved method prescribed by the state toxicologist.

        The trial court erroneously refused requested instruction on the duty of a driver to appropriately signal a sudden stop or decrease in speed. Although the trial court gave an instruction on brake lights which encompassed this section and N.D.C.C. § 39-21-19(1), and, although the trial court instructed that ordinary care was required in operating a motor vehicle, it did not instruct on the duty to signal before a stop, as requested. While the violation of a statutory duty is not negligence per se, it is evidence of negligence. Gronneberg v. Hoffart, 466 N.W.2d 809, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Where there was evidence that a “sudden emergency” arose when defendant braked unexpectedly to avoid hitting the pickup that he was following, but gave no warning of his sudden stop, the trial court erroneously refused requested jury instruction on sudden emergency.

        The trial court erroneously refused requested instruction on the duty of a driver to appropriately signal a sudden stop or decrease in speed. Although the trial court gave an instruction on brake lights which encompassed N.D.C.C. §§ 39-21-06(1) and this section, and, although the trial court instructed that ordinary care was required in operating a motor vehicle, it did not instruct on the duty to signal before a stop, as requested. While the violation of a statutory duty is not negligence per se, it is evidence of negligence. Gronneberg v. Hoffart, 466 N.W.2d 809, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Where there was evidence that a “sudden emergency” arose when defendant braked unexpectedly to avoid hitting the pickup that he was following, but gave no warning of his sudden stop, the trial court erroneously refused requested jury instruction on sudden emergency.

        Prohibited Use of High-Beam Headlights.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because N.D.C.C. § 39-21-21 prohibited any use of high-beam headlights within 500 feet of an oncoming vehicle, a deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant for violating the statute; the deputy testified that he was about an eighth of a mile away from defendant’s vehicle when the flashing began. The trial court reasoned that the parties were moving and would have entered the 500-foot zone pretty quickly; thus, the investigative stop of defendant’s vehicle was constitutionally permissible, and her motion to suppress evidence was properly denied.

      When the department has reason to believe that an approved lighting device or other safety equipment, component, or assembly being sold commercially does not comply with the requirements of this chapter, the department may, after giving thirty days’ previous notice to the person holding the certificate of approval for the device in this state, conduct a hearing upon the question of compliance of the approved device. After the hearing, the department shall determine whether the approved device meets the requirements of this chapter. If the device does not meet the requirements of this chapter, the department shall give notice to the person holding the certificate of approval for the device in this state of its intention to revoke the approval.
     </p>
     <p>
      If at the expiration of ninety days after notice the person holding the certificate of approval for the device has failed to satisfy the department that the approved device to be sold meets the requirements of this chapter, the department shall suspend or revoke the approval issued for the device. The department may require that devices sold after the notification following the hearing be replaced with devices that do comply with the requirements of this chapter and shall require the withdrawal of those devices from the market.

     <p>
      When an approval has been suspended or revoked pursuant to this section, the device may not again be approved unless and until it has been submitted for approval and it has been demonstrated, in the same manner as in an application for an original approval, that the device meets the requirements of this chapter. The department may at the time of the retest purchase in the open market and submit to the testing agency one or more sets of the approved devices, and if the device upon retest fails to meet the requirements of this chapter, the department may refuse to renew the certificate of approval of the device. The department may require that all previously approved devices be effectively recalled and removed from the market as a condition for reapproval.

       Every motor vehicle, other than a motorcycle or motor-driven cycle, when operated upon a highway must be equipped with brakes adequate to control the movement of and to stop and hold such vehicle, including two separate means of applying the brakes, each of which means must be effective to apply the brakes to at least two wheels. If these two separate means of applying the brakes are connected in any way, they must be so constructed that failure of any one part of the operating mechanism does not leave the motor vehicle without brakes on at least two wheels.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-21s39-21-32ol12">
       Every farm tractor, motorcycle, and motor-driven cycle, when operated upon a highway, must be equipped with at least one brake, which may be operated by hand or foot.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-21s39-21-32ol13">
       Every trailer or semitrailer when operated upon a highway at a speed in excess of twenty-five miles [40.23 kilometers] per hour must be equipped with safety chains or brakes adequate to control the movement of and to stop and to hold such vehicle and so designed as to be applied by the driver of the towing motor vehicle from its cab, and said brakes must be so designed and connected that in case of an accidental breakaway of the towed vehicle the brakes are automatically applied.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c39-21s39-21-32ol14">
       One of the means of brake operation must be parking brakes adequate to hold the vehicle on any grade on which it is operated, under all conditions of loading, on a surface free from snow, ice, or loose material. The parking brakes must be capable of being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements by the driver’s muscular effort or by spring action or by equivalent means. Their operation may be assisted by the service brakes or other source of power provided that failure of the service brake actuation system or other power-assisting mechanism will not prevent the parking brakes from being applied in conformance with the foregoing requirements. The parking brakes must be so designed that when once applied they remain applied with the required effectiveness despite exhaustion of any source of energy or leakage of any kind. The same brakedrums, brakeshoes and lining assemblies, brakeshoe anchors, and mechanical brakeshoe actuation mechanism normally associated with the wheel brake assemblies may be used for both the service brakes and the parking brakes.

      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of statute is only evidence of negligence; bailor of automobile was not liable for injuries to third person struck when brakes failed where accident was due to sudden failure of brake cylinder and new brake lining had been installed 5,000 miles before time of accident. Lacy v. Grinsteinner, 190 N.W.2d 11, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       A violation of statute, standing alone, is not inevitably negligence per se. A violation is only evidence of negligence and evidence may raise a question of fact for the jury as to whether the degree of deficiency of brakes constitutes negligence and was a proximate cause of the accident. Greene v. Werven, 275 F.2d 134, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 5331 (8th Cir. N.D. 1960).

        The usual noise emitted from a vehicle which is equipped with a proper muffler and exhaust system is within the common knowledge of drivers. When a vehicle is emitting noise which is inordinate or beyond that which is proper or usual, the reasonable driver should be fully cognizant of the vehicle’s condition and of the possible violation of the law by driving such a vehicle.

       Officer had probable cause to stop defendant’s vehicle when he observed that defendant had tinted windows, in violation of N.D.C.C. § 39-21-39, even though the officer had received word to stop the vehicle based on an anonymous tip.

     <p>
      The provisions of this chapter or chapter 37-12-02 of the North Dakota Administrative Code relating to bumpers, tires, and fenders do not apply to street rod motor vehicles. However, a street rod must have all equipment, in operating condition, which was specifically required by law as a condition for its sale when it was first manufactured. A street rod is a modernized motor vehicle which was manufactured before 1949 by a recognized manufacturer and which retains the general appearance and original body configuration as manufactured or a motor vehicle designed and manufactured to resemble such a motor vehicle. A street rod may have improved modifications to the body, chassis, engine, brakes, power train, steering, and suspension systems either by modifying the original equipment or replacing original parts with fabricated parts or those taken from other existing vehicles. The director may adopt rules to implement this section.

        North Dakota Department of Transportation had authority under N.D.C.C. § 39-22-04 to suspend the car dealer’s motor vehicle dealer’s license for willfully violating N.D.C.C. § 39-04-17, it had the authority to consider past suspensions, and the finding that the dealer willfully violated § 39-04-17 was supported by the evidence.

    Bond required.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Before the issuance of a motor vehicle dealer’s license, as provided by law, the applicant for the license shall furnish a continuous surety bond executed by the applicant as principal and executed by a surety company, licensed and qualified to do business within the state of North Dakota, which bond must run to the state of North Dakota, be in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars and be conditioned upon the faithful compliance by the applicant as a dealer, if the license is issued to the dealer, that such dealer will comply with all of the statutes of the state of North Dakota regulating or being applicable to the business of the dealer as a dealer in motor vehicles, and indemnifying any person dealing or transacting business with the dealer in connection with any motor vehicle from any loss or damage occasioned by the failure of the dealer to comply with any of the provisions of this title, including the furnishing of a proper and valid certificate of title to the motor vehicle involved in any such transaction, and that the bond shall be filed with the director prior to the issuance of license provided by law. The aggregate liability of the surety of all persons, however, may in no event exceed the amount of the bond. Any third party sustaining injury within the terms of the bond may proceed against the principal and surety without making the state a party to the proceedings. The bond may be canceled by the surety, as to future liability, by giving written notice by certified mail, addressed to the principal at the address stated in the bond, and to the department. Thirty days after the mailing of the notice, the bond is null and void as to any liability thereafter arising. The surety remains liable, subject to the terms, conditions, and provisions of the bond until the effective date of the cancellation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An individual who operates a snowmobile on any public land or private land with public access is deemed to have given consent, and shall consent, subject to this chapter, to a chemical test, or tests, of the blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, or urine. As used in this chapter, the definitions in section 39-24-01 apply, and in addition, “chemical test” means any test or tests to determine the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, or urine, approved by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee under this chapter; and “drug” means any drug or substance or combination of drugs or substances which renders an individual incapable of safely operating a snowmobile. The chemical test must be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer only after placing the individual, except individuals mentioned in section 39-24.1-04, under arrest and informing that individual that the individual is or will be charged with the offense of operating a snowmobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or a combination thereof. For the purposes of this chapter, the taking into custody of a minor under section 27-20.4-05 satisfies the requirement of an arrest. The law enforcement officer shall also inform the individual charged that refusal of the individual to submit to the chemical test determined appropriate will result in that individual being prohibited from operating a snowmobile for up to three years. The law enforcement officer shall determine the chemical test to be used. When a minor is taken into custody for violating subdivision c of subsection 5 of section 39-24-09, the law enforcement officer shall diligently attempt to contact the minor’s parent or legal guardian to explain the cause for the custody and the implied consent chemical testing requirements.

      Only an individual medically qualified to draw blood, acting at the request of a law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood. The director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee shall determine the qualifications or credentials for being medically qualified to draw blood, and shall issue a list of approved designations including medical doctor and registered nurse. This limitation does not apply to the taking of a breath or urine specimen. The director of the state crime laboratory, or the director’s designee, shall electronically post a copy of the certified list of approved designations, including medical doctor and registered nurse, with the state crime laboratory division of the attorney general at the attorney general website and shall make the certified records required by this section available for download in a printable format on the attorney general website. The individual tested may have an individual of that individual’s own choosing, who is medically qualified to draw blood, administer a chemical test in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer with all costs of the additional chemical test to be the responsibility of the individual charged. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by an individual does not preclude the admission of the chemical test taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer. Upon the request of the individual who is tested, a copy of the operational checklist and test record of a breath sample test or analytical report of a blood or urine sample test taken at the direction of the law enforcement officer must be made available to that individual by the law enforcement agency that administered the chemical test.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided in this section, an individual under sixteen years of age who is not in possession of a valid operator’s license or permit to operate an off-highway vehicle may not, except upon the lands of the individual’s parent or guardian or as a participant in an organized sporting event that involves the use of off-highway vehicles, operate an off-highway vehicle. An individual at least twelve years of age may operate an off-highway vehicle if the individual has completed an off-highway vehicle safety training course prescribed by the director of the parks and recreation department and has received the appropriate off-highway vehicle safety certificate issued by the director of the parks and recreation department. The failure of an operator to exhibit an off-highway vehicle safety certificate on demand to any official authorized to enforce this chapter is presumptive evidence that that person does not hold a certificate. Fees collected from each individual receiving certification must be deposited in the off-highway vehicle trail tax fund for off-highway vehicle safety education and training programs.

If any action is brought by a state’s attorney to punish, prevent, or restrain any activity made unlawful under section 39-30-02, the running of the period of limitations is suspended during the pendency of such action and for two years following its termination.
