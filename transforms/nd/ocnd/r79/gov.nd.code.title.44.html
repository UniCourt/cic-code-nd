      <p>
       Term of governor begins on January 1 and terminates on December 31 in fourth year thereafter, and governor-elect can assume duties of office as of January 1 next succeeding his election without affecting term of office; however, a governor may serve less than four years if, upon his own choosing, he does not take office until subsequent to January 1 next succeeding his election. Therefore, when incumbent governor was elected in 1980 and chose not to assume duties of his office until January 6, 1981, his term of office was from January 1, 1981 to December 31, 1984, and governor-elect in 1984 was entitled to hold office of governor from first moment of January 1, 1985 where he filed his oath of office on December 31, 1984 and chose to assume office on January 1, 1985.

    Oath of civil officers.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each civil officer in this state before entering upon the duties of that individual’s office shall take and subscribe the oath prescribed in section 4 of article XI of the Constitution of North Dakota. The oath must be endorsed upon the back of, or attached to, the commission, appointment, or certificate of election. The term civil officer includes every elected official and any individual appointed by such elected official; any individual appointed by the governor and required by section 16.1-09-02 to file a statement of interests with the secretary of state; appointed member of any state authority, board, bureau, commission, and council; and the appointed head of any state agency and agency division, whether the individual serves with or without compensation. Except for an individual appointed to fill a vacancy existing in the legislative assembly, the term does not include any individual receiving a legislative appointment. For purposes of this chapter and chapter 44-05, the term civil officer has the same meaning as public officer.

      A vacancy in any county office, other than that of county commissioner, must be filled by the board of county commissioners, with the exception that if a vacancy has occurred in the office of state’s attorney by reason of removal under section 44-11-01, the appointment must be made by the board of county commissioners by and with the advice and consent of the governor. The board of county commissioners may declare a county office to be vacant whenever the officeholder is unable to perform the duties of the office for six months or more. However, if within one year the officeholder should become able to perform the officeholder’s duties, the county commissioners may, for good cause shown, reinstate the officeholder.

     <p>
      When the incumbent of any elective office in this state is unable to discharge the duties of the incumbent’s office by reason of service in the armed forces of the United States, an acting official who shall have the powers of the incumbent must be appointed in the same manner that an appointment would be made in case of a vacancy in office, the appointment being made from a list of three names which must be submitted by the incumbent to the appointing body or officer within thirty days after leaving for the service. Provided, however, in the office of state’s attorney the names of practicing attorneys residing in adjoining counties may be included if there are less than three practicing attorneys residing in such county in which the appointment is to be made. If the incumbent has already entered the military service the incumbent shall, within ten days after the passage and approval of this section, file a list of three names with the appointing body or officer. If the incumbent fails to submit a list of names, the appointing body or officer shall make the appointment of the acting official without regard to the incumbent’s wishes; provided, however, that in the filling of such vacancy in the office of state’s attorney, a practicing attorney from an adjoining county may be named to fill such vacancy if there are less than three practicing attorneys residing in the county where such vacancy is to be filled. Provided, further, the acting official shall serve, and the acting official’s tenure of office must be terminated immediately upon the incumbent filing a “notice of return” with the secretary of state in instances in which it is a state official, or with the county auditor when the incumbent is an official of the county or any of its subdivisions. This section is hereby declared to be retroactive and all appointments to vacancies heretofore made in the manner herein provided are hereby validated.

       Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, all records of a public entity are public records, open and accessible for inspection during reasonable office hours. As used in this subsection, “reasonable office hours” includes all regular office hours of a public entity. If a public entity does not have regular office hours, the name and telephone number of a contact person authorized to provide access to the public entity’s records must be posted on the door of the office of the public entity, if any. Otherwise, the information regarding the contact person must be filed with the secretary of state for state-level entities, for public entities defined in subdivision c of subsection 13 of section 44-04-17.1, the city auditor or designee of the city for city-level entities, or the county auditor or designee of the county for other entities.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol12">
       Upon request for a copy of specific public records, any entity subject to subsection 1 shall furnish the requester one copy of the public records requested. An initial request need not be made in person or in writing, and the copy must be mailed upon request. A public entity may require written clarification of the request to determine what records are being requested, but may not ask for the motive or reason for requesting the records or for the identity of the person requesting public records. A public entity may charge up to twenty-five cents per impression of a paper copy. As used in this section, “paper copy” means a one-sided or two-sided duplicated copy of a size not more than eight and one-half by fourteen inches [19.05 by 35.56 centimeters]. For any copy of a record that is not a paper copy as defined in this section, the public entity may charge a reasonable fee for making the copy. As used in this section, “reasonable fee” means the actual cost to the public entity of making the copy, including labor, materials, and equipment. The entity may charge for the actual cost of postage to mail a copy of a record. An entity may require payment before locating, redacting, making, or mailing the copy. The public entity may withhold records pursuant to a request until such time as a requester provides payment for any outstanding balance for prior requests. An entity may impose a fee not exceeding twenty-five dollars per hour per request, excluding the initial hour, for locating records, including electronic records, if locating the records requires more than one hour. An entity may impose a fee not exceeding twenty-five dollars per hour per request, excluding the initial hour, for excising confidential or closed material under section 44-04-18.10 from the records, including electronic records. If a public entity receives five or more requests from the same requester within seven days, the public entity may treat the requests as one request in computing the time it takes to locate and excise the records. If the entity is not authorized to use the fees to cover the cost of providing or mailing the copy, or both, or if a copy machine is not readily available, the entity may make arrangements for the copy to be provided or mailed, or both, by another entity, public or private, and the requester shall pay the fee to that other entity. This subsection does not apply to copies of public records for which a different fee is specifically provided by law.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol13">
       Automation of public records must not erode the right of access to those records. As each public entity increases its use of and dependence on electronic recordkeeping, each agency must provide reasonable public access to records electronically maintained and must ensure that exempt or confidential records are not disclosed except as otherwise permitted by law. A public entity may not enter into a contract for the creation or maintenance of a public records database if that contract impairs the ability of the public to inspect or copy the public records of the agency, including public records online or stored in an electronic recordkeeping system used by the agency. An electronic copy of a record must be provided upon request at no cost, other than costs allowed in subsection 2, except if the nature or volume of the public records requested to be accessed or provided requires extensive use of information technology resources, the agency may charge no more than the actual cost incurred for the extensive use of information technology resources incurred by the public entity. “Extensive” is defined as a request for copies of electronic records which take more than one hour of information technology resources to produce.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol14">
       Except as provided in this subsection, nothing in this section requires a public entity to create or compile a record that does not exist. Access to an electronically stored record under this section, or a copy thereof, must be provided at the requester’s option in either a printed document or through any other available medium. A computer file is not an available medium if no means exist to separate or prevent the disclosure of any closed or confidential information contained in that file. Except as reasonably necessary to reveal the organization of data contained in an electronically stored record, a public entity is not required to provide an electronically stored record in a different structure, format, or organization. This section does not require a public entity to provide a requester with access to a computer terminal or mobile device. A public entity is not required to provide a copy of a record that is available to the requester on the public entity’s website or on the internet. The public entity shall notify the requester the record is available online and direct the requester to the website where the record can be accessed. If the requester does not have reasonable access to the internet due to lack of computer, lack of internet availability, or inability to use a computer or the internet, the public entity shall produce paper copies for the requester, but may charge the applicable fees under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol15">
       A state-level public entity as defined in subdivision a of subsection 13 of section 44-04-17.1 or a political subdivision as defined in subsection 11 of section 44-04-17.1, may establish procedures for providing access from an outside location to any computer database or electronically filed or stored information maintained by that entity. The procedures must address the measures that are necessary to maintain the confidentiality of information protected by federal or state law. Except for access provided to another state-level public entity or political subdivision, the state or political subdivision may charge a reasonable fee for providing that outside access. If the original information is keyed, entered, provided, compiled, or submitted by any political subdivision, the fees must be shared by the state and the political subdivision based on their proportional costs to make the data available.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol16">
       Any request under this section for records in the possession of a public entity by a party to a criminal or civil action, adjudicative proceeding as defined in subsection 1 of section 28-32-01, or arbitration in which the public entity is a party, or by an agent of the party, must comply with applicable discovery rules or orders and be made to the attorney representing that entity in the criminal or civil action, adjudicative proceeding, or arbitration. The public entity may deny a request from a party or an agent of a party under this subsection if the request seeks records that are privileged under applicable discovery rules.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol17">
       A denial of a request for records made under this section must describe the legal authority for the denial, or a statement that a record does not exist, and must be in writing if requested.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol18">
       This section is violated when a person’s right to review or receive a copy of a record that is not exempt or confidential is denied or unreasonably delayed or when a fee is charged in excess of the amount authorized in subsections 2 and 3.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol19">
       It is not an unreasonable delay or a denial of access under this section to withhold from the public a record that is prepared at the express direction of, and for presentation to, a governing body until the record is mailed or otherwise provided to a member of the body or until the next meeting of the body, whichever occurs first. It also is not an unreasonable delay or a denial of access to withhold from the public a working paper or preliminary draft until a final draft is completed, the record is distributed to a member of a governing body or discussed by the body at an open meeting, or work is discontinued on the draft but no final version has been prepared, whichever occurs first.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol110">
       For public entities headed by a single individual, it is not an unreasonable delay or a denial of access to withhold from the public a working paper or preliminary draft until a final draft is completed, or work is discontinued on the draft but no final version has been prepared, whichever occurs first. A working paper or preliminary draft shall be deemed completed if it can reasonably be concluded, upon a good-faith review, that all substantive work on it has been completed.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol111">
       A disclosure of a requested record under this section is not a waiver of any copyright held by the public entity in the requested record or of any applicable evidentiary privilege.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol112">
       A public entity may allow an individual to utilize the individual’s own personal devices for duplication of records and, if so, shall establish reasonable procedures to protect the integrity of the records as long as the procedures are not used to prevent access to the records.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-18ol113">
       If repeated requests for records disrupt other essential functions of the public entity, the public entity may refuse to permit inspection of the records, or provide copies of the records. A public entity refusing to provide access or copies of public records under this section shall state in writing the reasons supporting the refusal and provide the reasoning to the requester. The requester may seek an attorney general’s opinion under section 44-04-21.1, on whether the public entity’s decision was proper.

        The term “support”, as used in the open records law, means something other than an exchange of money for identifiable and specific goods and services; when there is a bargained-for exchange of value, a quid pro quo, the entity is not supported by public funds. As such, those agencies or organizations carrying out business with the state or employed by the state are not subjected to the open records law. Adams County Record v. Greater N.D.

      If a public entity or any person delegated authority by a public entity to review applications or make hiring decisions receives applications from three or more applicants who meet the minimum qualifications for a vacant position, the public entity or other person shall designate three or more of the qualified applicants as finalists for further consideration before the public entity or other person may issue an offer of employment to fill the position. However, if the public entity or other person does not wish to consider any of the applications further and decides not to make an offer of employment for the vacant position, the public entity need not designate any finalist. The applications and any records related to the applications which contain information that could reasonably be used to identify an applicant are exempt. Once the finalists are designated, the applications and related records of the finalists are open to the public. The public entity or other person reviewing applications on behalf of the public entity shall comply with all requirements for an executive session to discuss exempt applications. If, by the close of the application period for a vacant position, a public entity receives applications from fewer than three applicants who meet the minimum qualifications, the applications and records related to the applications are open to the public. A public entity may adopt policies regarding the release of exempt records under this section.

        School board violated the open meeting law where teacher evaluations were discussed at a closed secret meeting, for all intents and purposes the nonrenewal of the teacher’s contract was determined as a result of the closed meeting, and the decision to nonrenew made at a later public open meeting was merely a pro forma ratification of the significant discussions had at the closed meeting; proper remedy for such violation was to permit the school board to again go through the entire required nonrenewal procedures according to a time schedule set up by the court where the time requirements of the nonrenewal statutes could not be met.

       Attorney consultation is exempt from section 44-04-19. That portion of a meeting of a governing body during which an attorney consultation occurs may be closed by the governing body under section 44-04-19.2.

       “Adversarial administrative proceedings” include only those administrative proceedings in which the administrative agency or institution of higher education acts as a complainant, respondent, or decisionmaker in an adverse administrative proceeding. This term does not refer to those instances in which the administrative agency or institution acts in its own rulemaking capacity.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-19.36ol15">
       “Attorney consultation” means any discussion between a governing body and its attorney in instances in which the governing body seeks or receives the attorney’s advice regarding and in anticipation of reasonably predictable or pending civil or criminal litigation or adversarial administrative proceedings or to receive its attorney’s advice and guidance on the legal risks, strengths, and weaknesses of an action of a public entity which, if held in public, would have an adverse fiscal effect on the entity. All other discussions beyond the attorney’s advice and guidance must be made in the open, unless otherwise provided by law. Mere presence or participation of an attorney at a meeting is not sufficient to constitute attorney consultation.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-19.36ol16">
       “Attorney work product” means any document or record that:

      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-19.36ol17">
       “Investigatory work product” means records obtained, compiled, or prepared by a public entity in an effort to monitor and enforce compliance with the law or an order. Investigatory work product must be considered active as long as it is related to monitoring and enforcement activity conducted with a reasonable good-faith belief that it will lead to enforcement of the law or an order the public entity is charged by statute or other law with monitoring and enforcing.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-19.36ol18">
       Following the final completion of the civil or criminal litigation or the adversarial administrative proceeding, including the exhaustion of all appellate remedies, attorney work product must be made available for public disclosure by the public entity, unless another exception to section 44-04-18 applies or if disclosure would have an adverse fiscal effect on the conduct or settlement of other pending or reasonably predictable civil or criminal litigation or adversarial administrative proceedings, or the attorney work product reflects mental impressions, opinions, conclusions, or legal theories regarding potential liability of a public entity.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-19.36ol19">
       A governing body may hold an executive session under section 44-04-19.2 to discuss negotiating strategy or provide negotiating instructions to its attorney or other negotiator regarding a pending claim, litigation, adversarial administrative proceedings, or contracts, which are currently being negotiated or for which negotiation is reasonably likely to occur in the immediate future. An executive session may be held under this subsection only when an open meeting would have an adverse fiscal effect on the bargaining or litigating position of the public entity. A record revealing negotiation strategy or instruction under this section is exempt. Drafts of contracts or agreements subject to negotiations are exempt but only for so long as release would have an adverse fiscal effect on the public entity, unless the records are otherwise exempt or confidential.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-19.36ol110">
       Nothing in this section may be construed to waive any attorney-client privilege of a public entity as defined in subdivision c of subsection 13 of section 44-04-17.1 regarding matters that do not pertain to public business.

      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-19.36ol111">
       A settlement agreement between a public entity and another party is exempt from disclosure until it has been fully executed and accepted by all concerned parties unless the records are otherwise exempt or confidential. In the case of multiple settlement agreements involving multiple parties involved in the same incident or undertaking, a settlement agreement is exempt until settlement agreements have been fully executed by all concerned parties unless the records are otherwise exempt or confidential.

      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-19.36ol112">
       Unless subject to subsection 6 of section 44-04-18, active litigation records are exempt from section 44-04-18. For purposes of this subsection, “active litigation records” means records obtained, compiled, or prepared by a public entity or the attorney representing a public entity for the purpose of litigation unless the records already have been filed publicly or the litigation is completed.

      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-21.39ol11">
       Any interested person may request an attorney general’s opinion to review a written denial of a request for records under section 44-04-18, a denial of access to a meeting under section 44-04-19, or other alleged violation of section 44-04-18, 44-04-19, 44-04-19.2, 44-04-20, or 44-04-21 by any public entity other than the legislative assembly or any committee thereof. A request made under this section must be made within thirty days of the alleged violation, except that a request based on allegations that a meeting occurred without the notice required by section 44-04-20, must be made within ninety days of the alleged violation. In preparing an opinion under this section, the attorney general has discretion to obtain and review a recording made under section 44-04-19.2. The attorney general may request and obtain information claimed to be exempt or confidential for the purpose of determining whether the information is exempt or confidential. Any such information may not be released by the attorney general and may be returned to the provider of the information. The attorney general shall issue to the public entity involved an opinion on the alleged violation, which may be a summary opinion, unless the request is withdrawn by the person requesting the opinion or a civil action has been filed involving the possible violation. If the request pertains to a public entity as defined in subdivision c of subsection 13 of section 44-04-17.1, the opinion must be issued to the public entity providing the public funds. In any opinion issued under this section, the attorney general shall base the opinion on the facts given by the public entity.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-21.39ol12">
       If the attorney general issues a written opinion concluding that a violation has occurred, the public entity has seven days after the opinion is issued, regardless of whether a civil action is filed under section 44-04-21.2, to disclose the record, to issue a notice of a meeting that will be held within a reasonable time to correct the violation, or to take steps to correct any other violation. If the public entity fails to take the required action within the seven-day period and the person requesting the opinion prevails in a civil action brought under section 44-04-21.2, the person must be awarded costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorney’s fees in the action and on appeal. The attorney general may require officials of the public entity at issue in the opinion to obtain mandatory training by a certain date. The consequences for failing to comply with an attorney general’s opinion issued under this section will be the same as for other attorney general’s opinions, including potential personal liability for the person or persons responsible for the noncompliance.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-04s44-04-21.39ol13">
       If a state-level public entity as defined in subdivision a of subsection 13 of section 44-04-17.1 does not comply in full with the attorney general’s opinion, and a civil action is brought under section 44-04-21.2 or is reasonably predictable, the entity, at its sole cost and expense, shall retain separate counsel who has been approved and appointed by the attorney general as a special assistant attorney general to represent the entity in that action.

For an alleged violation of section 44-04-18, the complaint must be accompanied by a dated, written request for the requested record. If a court finds that any of these sections have been violated by a public entity, the court may award declaratory relief, an injunction, a writ of prohibition or mandamus, costs, disbursements, and reasonable attorney’s fees against the entity. For an intentional or knowing violation of section 44-04-18, 44-04-19, 44-04-19.2, 44-04-20, or 44-04-21, the court may also award damages in an amount equal to one thousand dollars or actual damages caused by the violation, whichever is greater. An action under this subsection must be commenced within sixty days of the date the person knew or should have known of the violation or within thirty days of issuance of an attorney general’s opinion on the alleged violation, whichever is later. Venue for an action is in the county where the entity has its principal office or, if the entity does not have a principal office within the state, in Burleigh County.

An interested person or entity may not file a civil action under this section seeking attorney’s fees or damages, or both, until at least three working days after providing notice of the alleged violation to the chief administrative officer for the public entity. This subsection does not apply if the attorney general has found under section 44-04-21.1, on a prior occasion, that the public entity has violated section 44-04-18, 44-04-19, 44-04-19.2, 44-04-20, or 44-04-21.

        A notary public is authorized to administer the oath to a witness testifying at a hearing before the board of city commissioners in a proceeding to remove city officers. State ex rel. Ness v.

       <p>
        Clerk of court’s attestation on the affidavit in support of the search warrant did not invalidate the search warrant or require suppression of evidence because there was no evidence that defendant was prejudiced by the violation of N.D.R.Crim.P. 41(c)(1)(A) or that State intentionally or deliberately disregarded the rule. The affiant was an attorney and the district court judge had the ability to contact him to clarify any questions the judge may have had about the affidavit.

       <p>
        Civil procedure rules allow for telephonic testimony and allow judges to administer oaths to witnesses; adequate safeguards were in place to ensure the witness was properly identified and understood the seriousness of the matter and possible penalty for perjury. Zuraff v. Reiger, 2018 ND 143, 911 N.W.2d 887, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in allowing a father’s mother to testify telephonically because it determined there were adequate safeguards in place; the identity of the father’s mother was reasonably verified through her testimony, and the district court administered an oath to her, which could be effective even though it was administered to a witness in Washington because she could be subject to prosecution under either Washington or North Dakota law. Zuraff v. Reiger, 2018 ND 143, 911 N.W.2d 887, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Concerns in a civil case regarding testimony through contemporaneous transmission is different from a criminal case; therefore, if testimony from a deposition taken in a foreign country or testimony through contemporaneous transmission may be used against a criminal defendant, it reasonably follows that contemporaneous sworn testimony may be used in a civil case. Zuraff v. Reiger, 2018 ND 143, 911 N.W.2d 887, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 2018).

      Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the failure of a notarial officer to perform the duties or meet the requirements specified in this chapter does not invalidate a notarial act performed by the notarial officer. The validity of a notarial act under this chapter does not prevent an aggrieved person from seeking to invalidate the record or transaction that is the subject of the notarial act or from seeking other remedies based on other laws of this state or law of the United States. This section does not validate a purported notarial act performed by an individual who does not have the authority to perform the act.

      A notary who has legally changed the notary’s name shall submit to the secretary of state a rider to the notary’s surety bond stating both the old and new names, the effective date of the new name, and a ten dollar fee within sixty days of the name change.

    Political subdivisions authorized to purchase insurance on the life of law enforcement officer — Benefits payable to dependent survivor.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any political subdivision may purchase insurance on the life of a law enforcement officer employed by that political subdivision. Such insurance policy must be purchased from an insurance company licensed to do business in this state. If the insurance is purchased, the officer insured thereunder may designate that officer’s dependent survivor or survivors to whom the death benefit provided under the policy must be paid. The word “dependent” means that the deceased officer provided some financial support within one year before the officer’s death to the survivor and must be liberally construed for the purposes of this section. In the event the officer has not designated a dependent survivor or survivors, the death benefit payable must be paid to the closest survivor in the following order:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t44c44-08s44-08-17ol11">
       Spouse.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-08s44-08-17ol12">
       Children.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-08s44-08-17ol13">
       Parent.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-08s44-08-17ol14">
       Brother or sister.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      However, if there is more than one qualifying survivor in subsection 2, 3, or 4, the death benefit must be paid in equal shares to the survivors in that category. The death benefit provided by an insurance policy purchased pursuant to this section may not exceed the amount of ten thousand dollars on the life of one law enforcement officer. Any death benefit paid due to purchase of an insurance policy under the provisions of this section must be in addition to any benefits paid due to the death of that officer under any other provisions of law.

        It was error to revoke a driver’s driving privileges for refusal to submit to a chemical test, based on the non-member Indian driver’s purported arrest on tribal land by a county deputy, because (1) a tribal officer’s request for assistance from the county did not extend criminal jurisdiction to the state, as the state could not unilaterally extend its criminal jurisdiction onto tribal land, and (2) no agreement between the county and the tribe authorizing the deputy to act on tribal land or tribal laws giving the deputy authority to make a citizen’s arrest were shown.

        Although the warrantless search of defendant’s car occurred outside the jurisdiction of the tribal police and in violation of N.D.C.C. §
   44-08-20, nonetheless, defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained in the search was denied because this was only one factor for consideration and, under the circumstances, the search was conducted in conformity with the Fourth Amendment as (1) police had probable cause to believe that the car had been involved in drive-by shootings at a residence where defendant had previously made death threats over the telephone, (2) the car was abandoned in an empty field, and (3) exigent circumstances justified the search as the car had been involved in a high-speed chase, and police reasonably believed that defendant was nearby and had the propensity to carry out his threats. United States v. Peach, 327 F. Supp. 2d 1081, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14573 (D.N.D. 2004).

        N.D.C.C. §§
   11-15-02 and 40-20-05 recognize that a sheriff and his or her few regular deputies cannot always provide adequate law enforcement services in large and sparsely populated rural counties unless municipal police officers, by their appointment as permanent special deputies, are able to assist and provide services to the areas which surround their communities; in such circumstances, a sheriff could reasonably determine that the appointment of a municipal police officer as a permanent special deputy, to serve when the sheriff or regular deputies are unavailable or understaffed, is required by the conditions.

      <li id="t44c44-08s44-08-21ol11">
       An elected official of a political subdivision, except a township officer or an official subject to recall under section 10 of article III of the Constitution of North Dakota, is subject to recall by petition of electors equal in number to twenty-five percent of the voters who voted in the most recent election that the official sought to be recalled was on the ballot, not including other recall elections. An official who was appointed to fill a vacancy is subject to recall by petition of electors equal in number to twenty-five percent of the voters who voted in the most recent election that the office of the official sought to be recalled was on the ballot, not including other recall elections. The provisions of section 16.1-01-09.1, as they relate to signing and circulating recall petitions, apply to petitions under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-08s44-08-21ol12">
       A recall petition must include a stated reason for the recall and be approved as to form before circulation by the secretary of state. The secretary of state shall complete the review of the form of a recall petition in not less than five, nor more than seven, business days, excluding Saturdays. To be effective, a recall petition must be submitted to the appropriate filing officer within ninety days after the date the recall petition is approved for circulation by the secretary of state.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-08s44-08-21ol13">
       Once circulated, the recall petition must be filed with the filing officer with whom a petition for nomination to the office in question is filed unless that filing officer is the individual subject to recall, in which case the petition must be filed with the secretary of state. The filing officer with whom the petition is filed shall pass on the sufficiency of a petition pursuant to section 16.1-01-09.1. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the filing officer shall call a special election to be held not sooner than ninety-five days nor later than one hundred five days following the date the filing officer certifies the petition valid and sufficient. No special election may be called if that date would be within ninety-five days of the next scheduled election. An elector’s name may not be removed from a recall petition that has been submitted to and received by the appropriate filing officer.
      </li>
      <li id="t44c44-08s44-08-21ol14">
       The name of the official to be recalled must be placed on the ballot unless the official resigns within ten days after the filing officer certifies the petition is valid and sufficient. Other candidates for the office may be nominated in a manner provided by law and shall file nominating papers with the appropriate filing officer by the sixty-fourth day before the scheduled recall election. If the official resigns, the appropriate political subdivision governing body may call a special election or appoint an individual to complete the unexpired term of the office. When the election results have been officially declared, the candidate receiving the highest number of votes is elected for the remainder of the term. No official is subject to recall twice during the term for which the official was elected. An official whose office is on the ballot at a regularly scheduled election occurring within one year is not subject to recall if the recall special election would occur within one year of the next regularly scheduled election in which the official could be re-elected.

      The sole power of impeachment is vested in the house of representatives. A concurrence of a majority of all members is necessary to the exercise thereof. All impeachments must be tried by the senate sitting for that purpose, and the senators must be upon oath or affirmation to do justice according to law and the evidence. When the governor or lieutenant governor is on trial, the chief justice of the supreme court shall preside, or if the chief justice is disqualified or unable to preside, then some other judge of said court must be selected by the senate. No person may be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the senators elected.

      The senate, whenever articles of impeachment are presented to it by or on behalf of the house of representatives, must assign a day for the hearing of the impeachment and inform the house thereof. The day so assigned may not be earlier in the session than that at which the completion of the business of the legislative assembly may be effected.

    Senate may make rules for trial — Subpoenas.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The senate sitting as a court of impeachment has full power and authority to establish such rules and regulations for the trial of the accused as may be necessary, has power to adjourn from time to time, dissolve when its work is concluded, and compel obedience to its process and orders. Its process, including subpoenas, runs into every part of the state and may be served by the same officers as other process or by any person authorized by the presiding officer of the court to serve the same, and has the same force and effect as subpoenas from district courts in criminal actions.
