       Declaration of legislative intent.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Adequate roads and streets provide for the free flow of traffic; result in low cost of motor vehicle operation; protect the health and safety of the citizens of the state; increase property value; and generally promote economic and social progress of the state. Therefore, the legislative assembly hereby determines and declares that an adequate and integrated system of roads and streets is essential to the general welfare of the state of North Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      In designating the highway systems of this state, as hereinafter provided, the legislative assembly places a high degree of trust in the hands of those officials whose duty it is, within the limits of available funds, to plan, develop, operate, maintain, and protect the highway facilities of this state, for present as well as for future use. To this end, it is the intent of the legislative assembly to make the director of the department, and the department acting through the director, custodian of the state highway system and to provide sufficiently broad authority to enable the director of the department to function adequately and efficiently in all areas of appropriate jurisdiction with specific details to be determined by reasonable rules and regulations which may be promulgated by the director, subject to the limitations of the constitution and the legislative mandate hereinafter imposed.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is recognized that the efficient management, operation, and control of our county roads, city streets, and other public thoroughfares are likewise a matter of vital public interest. Therefore, it is the further intent of the legislative assembly to bestow upon the boards of county commissioners similar authority with respect to the county road system and to local officials with respect to the roads under their jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      While it is necessary to fix responsibilities for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the several systems of highways, it is intended that the state of North Dakota shall have an integrated system of all roads and streets to provide safe and efficient highway transportation throughout the state. To this end, it is the intent of the legislative assembly to give broad authority and definite responsibility to the director of the department and to the boards of county commissioners so that working together, free from political pressure and local interests, they may provide for the state an integrated system of state and county highways built upon a basis of sound engineering with full regard to the interest and well-being of the state as a whole.
     </p>
     <p>
      Providing adequate public highway facilities, including rural and urban links, is hereby declared to be a proper public use and purpose and the legislative assembly hereby determines and declares that chapter 177 of the Session Laws of 1953 is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety, for the promotion of the general welfare, and as a contribution to the national defense.

   In situations where restrictions and regulations have been imposed upon the access of abutting owners, the question becomes one of whether, under the existing facts and circumstances, a reasonable means of access remains. If the abutter has free and convenient access to his property, and his means of ingress and egress are not substantially interfered with, he has no cause of complaint. Cady v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 472 N.W.2d 467, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   Loss of traffic, loss of business, and circuity of travel are factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the remaining access to and from an abutting roadway. Cady v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 472 N.W.2d 467, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   The “right of access” is a private right which entitles the abutting land owner just compensation if that right is impaired or destroyed. Cady v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 472 N.W.2d 467, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1991).

      The director is hereby vested with complete authority to designate, locate, create, and determine what roads, highways, and streets constitute the state highway system, subject however, to such conditions, requirements, and mileage limits as provided for by law. The total mileage of the state highway system may be increased by not more than fifty miles [80.47 kilometers] in any one calendar year. In designating, locating, creating, and determining the several routes of the state highway system, the director shall take into account such factors as the actual or potential traffic volumes, the type of service class, the construction of bypasses and alternate routes, the conservation and development of the state’s natural resources, the general economy of the state and communities, and the desirability of fitting such system into the general scheme of the nationwide network of highways.

      No person, firm, corporation, or limited liability company may place, put, or maintain any sign, billboard, or advertisement within the limits of a public highway, or in any manner paint, print, place, put, or affix, or cause to be painted, printed, placed, or affixed, any advertisement on or to any stone, tree, fence, stump, pole, mileboard, milestone, danger sign, danger signal, guide sign, guidepost, billboard, building, or other object within the limits of a public highway, or place, put or maintain any sign or billboard upon private property within one thousand feet [304.8 meters] of any highway grade crossing in such place or manner as to obstruct or interfere with a free and clear view of such crossing from any highway or railroad intersecting thereat. None of the provisions of this section prohibit the placing of public notices on billboards erected for that purpose by authority of the governing body of a municipality. Any advertisement in or upon a public highway or private property which, in the judgment of the director, may be deemed to be a hazard to traffic, or in the future may tend to create a hazard to traffic, may be taken down, removed, or destroyed by direction or authority of the department in the case of the state highway system, by the board of county commissioners in the case of the county road system, and by the board of township supervisors in the case of township roads.

   Although land acquired by purchase at a private sale was unnecessary for construction of the highway, the land was acquired for “highway purposes”, and the state therefore acquired no mineral interest in the land, where the land was purchased together with another tract of land that was necessary for highway construction because the state reasonably believed that it was more economical to purchase both tracts of land than to face protracted condemnation proceedings involving the necessary land, which the landowner was unwilling to convey separate from the unnecessary land.

      Whenever the director finds that it will facilitate travel and promote public convenience or that it will avoid the need for additional road building, the director may procure rights of way and other interests in land adjacent to established public highways for the location of custom and immigration buildings to be erected by the federal government.

Within fifteen days after the filing of such petition with the county auditor, the board of county commissioners shall fix a time and place, not later than sixty days from and after the filing of such petition, for a hearing of all persons interested or aggrieved by such taking, and shall cause to be published in the official newspaper of the county, at least once a week, for three successive weeks, prior to such hearing, a notice of such hearing, stating the time and place where the same shall be held, together with a description of the property to be taken. Such published notice must be in lieu of all other notices, and when so published must give the said board of county commissioners full and complete jurisdiction to proceed with the determination of awards of damages. A copy of such notice must be served personally upon all known owners residing or found within the state, and upon the occupant of the land, not less than fifteen days prior to such hearing, in the manner provided for the service of a summons in the district court, and in case of personal service of such notice upon all persons interested in any manner in said real property, as disclosed by the records in the office of the recorder of the county wherein said property is located, no publication of such notice may be made.

   Although the constitution and statutes use the term “appeal” to describe this procedure in quick-take proceedings, the court recognize that it is not, in fact, an appeal from a lower court to a higher court. The “appeal” envisioned by these proceedings is, rather, the first step in a judicial proceeding. Therefore, N.D.R.App.P. 3(c), specifying the contents of a notice of appeal in appellate proceedings, does not apply. Aalund v. Williams County, 442 N.W.2d 900, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

         Notice of Taking of Right of Way.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   This section clearly requires that the notice advise a landowner that a deposit has been made for a taking of right of way. Therefore, where the notice to landowner did not advise him that his property was being taken, rather merely informed him that the county was offering to purchase the land and that one thousand forty-five dollars had been deposited with the clerk of court, the statutory requirements had not been met, and the thirty-day appeal period did not begin.

   Where an expert witness testified that special benefits would accrue to land by reason of its proximity to an interchange upon an interstate highway but could not evaluate such benefits in dollars, and there was no other evidence of the value of such benefits, it was error to submit the issue of such prospective benefits to the jury.

   After a taking by a department of state for right of way purposes pursuant to section 14 of the constitution, the limitation of time within which an appeal may be taken commences to run after notice of deposit has been given to the landowner in writing by the clerk of the district court.

       Appeals from decision of board of county commissioners — Procedure — Special term of court.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any party aggrieved by the proceedings of the director in the taking of land or materials, or by the estimate of damages and the award of the board of county commissioners has the remedies provided in this title for appeal from any determination of a board of county commissioners in the taking of land for highway purposes. Service of a written or printed notice of such appeal must be made upon the chairman of the board of county commissioners and the director. An appeal from the award by the board of county commissioners, without filing a cost bond, may be taken by the director, by service of notice of appeal upon the chairman of the board of county commissioners and the owner of the property, in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons in a civil action. Upon any appeal, the director, on application to the judge of the district court, must be granted a special term of court, in the manner provided in cases of eminent domain in chapter 32-15.

        Use of Property Pending Appeal.

   Use of property pending an appeal would constitute at least a partial taking prior to determination of court that it was necessary and before compensation for it had been determined and paid into court so that former statute allowing condemner to use property pending appeal violated section 14 of Art. I of the state constitution of 1889 (see now, N.D. Const., Art. I, § 16). Kessler v. Thompson, 75 N.W.2d 172 (N.D. 1956), decided prior to the enactment of Art. I, § 16 of the N.D.

       Design of controlled-access facility.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The highway authorities of the state, or any county, or municipality are authorized to so design any controlled-access facility and to so regulate, restrict, or prohibit access as to best serve the traffic for which such facility is intended. In this connection such highway authorities are authorized to divide and separate any controlled-access facility into separate roadways by the construction of raised curbings, central dividing sections, or other physical separations, or by designating such separate roadways by signs, markers, stripes, and the proper lane for such traffic by appropriate signs, markers, stripes, and other devices. No person has any right of ingress or egress to, from or across controlled-access facilities to or from abutting lands, except at such designated points at which access may be permitted, upon such terms and conditions as may be specified from time to time.

       Acquisition of property and property rights.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purposes of chapter 177 of the 1953 Session Laws, the highway authorities of the state, or any county, or municipality may acquire private or public property and property rights for controlled-access facilities and service roads, including rights of access, air, view, lights, and such advertising rights outside of the right of way as may be determined by the director to be in the public interest, by gift, devise, purchase, or condemnation in the same manner as such units are now or hereafter may be authorized by law to acquire such property or property rights in connection with highways and streets within their respective jurisdictions. All property rights acquired under the provisions of chapter 177 of the 1953 Session Laws must be in fee simple, provided, however, as to any and all lands acquired or taken for highway, road, or street purposes, they may not obtain any rights or interest in or to the oil, gas, or fluid minerals underlying said lands. In connection with the acquisition of property or property rights for any controlled-access facility or portion thereof, or service road in connection therewith, the state, county, or municipal highway authority may, in its discretion, acquire an entire lot, block, or tract of land, if, by so doing, the interests of the public will be best served, even though said entire lot, block, or tract is not immediately needed for the right of way proper.

         Altering Right of Access in Future.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   In acquiring access control for a project, the state does not necessarily acquire the right to indiscriminately alter or eliminate access in the future without additional payment of compensation to property owner, but merely pays for damage suffered as the result of alteration of access arising from that particular project; whether property owner is entitled to additional compensation for subsequent alteration of access after state has acquired access control rights depends on whether the subsequent alteration made access unreasonable or substantially more unreasonable, and whether the interference with access caused by the subsequent alteration was within the contemplation of the parties at the time the state acquired the access control rights. Filler v. Minot, 281 N.W.2d 237, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 1979).

       <p>

   A landowner whose property abuts property taken by eminent domain for construction of a limited access highway has a right to reasonable, but not unlimited, ingress and egress to the property, and that right cannot be taken by the state without just compensation. Chandler v. Hjelle, 126 N.W.2d 141, 1964 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a condemnation proceeding it is error to instruct the jury that the right of a landowner whose property abuts a limited access highway to reasonable ingress and egress is subject to the “paramount right of the state”. Chandler v. Hjelle, 126 N.W.2d 141, 1964 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 1964).

       <p>

   Although land acquired by purchase at a private sale was unnecessary for construction of the highway, the land was acquired for “highway purposes”, and the state therefore acquired no mineral interest in the land, where the land was purchased together with another tract of land that was necessary for highway construction because the state reasonably believed that it was more economical to purchase both tracts of land than to face protracted condemnation proceedings involving the necessary land, which the landowner was unwilling to convey separate from the unnecessary land.

   In a condemnation proceeding it was not error to instruct the jury that “compensation may be calculated upon the basis of the most advantageous and valuable use of the property having regard to the existing business or wants of the community or such as may be reasonably expected in the immediate future”.

     <p>
      The highway authorities of the state, or any county, or municipality may designate and establish controlled-access highways as new and additional facilities or may designate and establish an existing street or highway as included within a controlled-access facility. The state or any of its subdivisions has authority to provide for the elimination of intersections at grade of controlled-access facilities with existing state and county roads, and municipal streets, by grade separation or service road, or by closing off such roads and streets at the right-of-way boundary lines of such controlled-access facility; and after the establishment of any controlled-access facility, no highway or street which is not part of said facility may intersect the same at grade. No municipal, county, or state highway, or other public way may be opened into or connected with any such controlled-access facility without the consent and previous approval of the highway authority in the state, county, or municipality having jurisdiction over such controlled-access facility. Such consent and approval may be given only if the public interest is served thereby.

   The classification they established by this section and section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-01s24-01-42" target="_self">24-01-42</a></cite> which restricts the placement of utility lines within 100 feet of state highways, but places no similar restrictions on the construction of fences, buildings, television towers, industrial facilities, or even a private road, does not deny equal protection because the legislature could reasonably have determined that the frequency with which utility lines are constructed near highways created the problem most in need of reform or that restricting the construction of utility lines would not materially diminish the value or usefulness of adjacent property, but that similar restrictions on other types of construction might materially diminish the value or usefulness of the property, thus resulting in a compensable taking unnecessarily costly to the state and unnecessarily detrimental to the landowner.

   Prohibiting a landowner, and thus his lessee or grantee, from constructing any electrical supply or communication line, or other pipeline within 100 feet of the center line of a state highway without the commissioner’s consent upon pain of removal at the expense of the utility, when such removal is required for highway expansion does nothing more than regulate one particular future use of property while leaving available to the property owner all other uses, thus, these sections do not prohibit all or substantially all reasonable uses of the regulated property as a whole.

       Access routes to controlled-access facility.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the construction of an interstate, controlled-access highway, results in the removal from the state highway system, a highway which passes through or approaches within one mile [1.61 kilometers] of any incorporated municipality, the director may if conditions warrant, expend state highway funds to the extent of not over twenty-five percent of the cost to construct access routes on the federal aid secondary county system. Only such access routes may be constructed as are not over three miles [4.83 kilometers] in length and are necessary to provide as good or better access from such municipalities to the network of the state highway system, as existed prior to the construction of such interstate highway.
     </p>
     <p>
      Such access routes may be constructed from the municipal limits to the interstate highway or in such other locations as will, in the opinion of the director, comply with the intent of the provisions of sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-01s24-01-47" target="_self">24-01-47</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-01s24-01-48" target="_self">24-01-48</a></cite>.

         Suit Against Commissioner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Suit against state highway commissioner in his official capacity is suit against state and subject to same defenses and immunities as though action were brought directly against state. Spielman v. State, 91 N.W.2d 627 (N.D. 1958), overruled on other grounds, Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr. Co., 521 N.W.2d 632 (N.D. 1994)

         Termination.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Where state highway commissioner was convicted of felony, his term of office terminated pro tanto, without an opportunity for a hearing before the governor. State ex rel. Salisbury v. Vogel, 65 N.D. 137, 256 N.W. 404, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>

   Jurisdictional requisites in case of removal of state highway commissioner for cause were: notice of time, place of hearing, and charges, reasonable opportunity to defend, and a decision upon proofs of record supporting it. State ex rel. Olson v. Welford, 65 N.D. 522, 260 N.W. 593, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>

   Certiorari was proper remedy to test jurisdiction of governor in proceeding to remove highway commissioner. State ex rel. Olson v. Welford, 65 N.D. 522, 260 N.W. 593, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>

   Erroneous classification of employees as to salary by the highway commissioner is not enough, by itself, to constitute a ground for his removal from office. State ex rel. Olson v. Welford, 65 N.D. 522, 260 N.W. 593, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>

   Governor was entitled to remove highway commissioner for failure to remedy and improve inadequate maintenance situation in highway system. State ex rel. Olson v. Welford, 65 N.D. 522, 260 N.W. 593, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1935).

      Whenever any estimate or allowance for payment, except a final estimate or payment subsequent to a final estimate, is allowed, or granted, on a contract entered into by the department, or a deposit is to be made with the clerk of district court in a condemnation proceeding, and the estimate is vouchered by the department for presentation to the office of management and budget, instead of submitting the estimate to the contractor or clerk of district court for certification, the director of the department or the director’s authorized designee shall make the following certificate, in lieu of the certificate otherwise required by law, which must be printed on the voucher or claim:
     </p>
     <p>
      Estimate certificate. I hereby certify that the within estimate or claim is just and true, that the contractor herein named has rendered the services and furnished the material herein charged, that they are of the value claimed, that no part thereof has been paid, and that the foregoing estimate or claim is supported by a proper contract and bond on file in the department or that the purpose of the payment to a clerk of district court is pursuant to law and for the taking of property by condemnation.

      After a certified estimate or deposit with a clerk of district court has been approved for payment by the director, the same must be presented to the office of management and budget for payment.

The foregoing procedure does not apply to the final estimate or allowance to a contractor, nor to any estimate or allowance subsequent or supplemental to the final estimate, but the final estimate or supplemental allowance must conform to the provisions of law relative to the certification and approval of any other claim or demand; nor does the procedure apply to payments to property owners involved in the taking of property in any condemnation proceeding.

      The director may request bids and award contracts for construction work requiring the contractor to furnish all equipment, labor, materials, and supplies for each particular contract or project, or requiring the director to furnish and provide the contractor with materials and supplies as the director may elect. If the director elects to provide materials and supplies for any project or construction work, the director shall notify the office of management and budget of the fact that the director has elected to furnish the materials and supplies. The office of management and budget may either exempt the purchase and allow the director to request and let bids and make the purchase, or the office of management and budget may handle the bidding and purchasing through its central purchasing agency. Either the office of management and budget or the director shall request proposals or bids for the total and aggregate of the materials and supplies for any and all projects or construction work according to the class, type, and nature of the materials and supplies and may award a contract or contracts therefor upon a basis deemed efficient and economical, whether upon the basis of delivery to the construction project directly or to a central storehouse or storehouses maintained by the state. The materials and supplies purchased by the office of management and budget or the department of transportation may be delivered to the project or construction work without expense to the contractor doing the construction work or may be sold to the contractor at cost and made to constitute a part of the construction cost, as the director may elect.

   Compulsory arbitration of disputes arising out of highway construction and repair contracts is not denial of due process under Art. I, §§ 13 and 22 of state constitution and Fourteenth Amendment of United States Constitution, nor denial of right to jury trial reserved under Art. I, § 7, of state constitution, and did not violate former Art.

       <p>

   Where an arbitrator’s alleged bias was not known prior to the hearing but only became apparent, at least to the highway department, by the manner and content of the arbitrator’s questioning, the highway department’s neglect to object did not constitute a waiver. Scherbenske Excavating v. North Dakota State Highway Dep't, 365 N.W.2d 485, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 281</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   In an arbitration proceeding between the highway department and a contractor, the department failed to establish bias of one of the arbitrators for the contractor where, although the department claimed difficult questioning by the arbitrator demonstrated his partiality, the arbitrators were expressly invited to question witnesses in a wide open manner, and the arbitrator, an expert in the field of highway construction, should have been expected to be demanding and probing; moreover, the department conceded the arbitrator’s alleged bias did not keep out any evidence the department sought to introduce.

   Imposition of sanctions by highway department for contractor’s alleged violation of contract provision requiring a minimum 10 percent of minority business enterprise participation under the contract arose out of the contract and, under this section, the issue was an appropriate subject for arbitration. Byron's Constr. Co. v. North Dakota State Highway Dep't, 448 N.W.2d 630, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 231</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       </h5>
       <p>

   The effect of applying the clearly irrational standard of review is to give to the arbitrators every benefit of every doubt. It affords them the widest latitude to exercise their authority and arrive at their decision without the customary restraints of traditional judicial review. It is but a reflection of the strong public policy favoring the arbitration process. There are no reasons compelling or persuasive enough to warrant revising the completely irrational standard of review. Scherbenske Excavating v. North Dakota State Highway Dep't, 365 N.W.2d 485, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 281</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   An arbitration award would not be vacated pursuant to former section 32-29-08(4) unless the award was completely irrational. Scherbenske Excavating v. North Dakota State Highway Dep't, 365 N.W.2d 485, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 281</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   The definitive constituents of a completely irrational award cannot be formulated in the abstract but, like all legal principles, can best be developed on a case-by-case basis.

       Condition precedent to contractor demand for highway construction arbitration — Claims for extra compensation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the provisions of section 24-02-30, full compliance by a contractor with the provisions of this section is a condition precedent to the contractor’s right to demand arbitration. If the contractor believes the contractor is entitled to additional compensation for work or materials not covered in the contract or not ordered by the engineer as extra work or force account work in accordance with the contract specifications, the contractor shall, prior to beginning the work which the claim will be based upon, notify the engineer in writing of the intent to make claim for additional compensation. If the basis for the claim does not become apparent until the contractor has commenced work on the project and it is not feasible to stop the work, the contractor shall immediately notify the engineer that the work is continuing and that written notification of the intent to make claim will be submitted within ten calendar days. Failure of the contractor to give the notification required and to afford the engineer facilities and assistance in keeping strict account of actual costs will constitute a waiver of claim for additional compensation in connection with the work already performed. Notification of a claim, and the fact that the engineer has kept account of the costs involved, may not be construed as proving or substantiating the validity or actual value of the claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      A contractor submitting a claim for compensation under this section, personally or on behalf of another person or entity, must do so in writing, not later than ninety days after the department has submitted the final estimate to the contractor. The claim must state the monetary amount of the claim, the reason for the claim, when the loss was incurred, and a short statement of the factual situation under which the claim arose. The claim must be made under oath or equivalent affirmation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director shall act on claims of less than three million dollars within sixty days after the claim is served upon the director. The director shall act on claims of three million dollars or more within one hundred eighty days after the claim is served upon the director. The contractor and the director may negotiate a supplemental agreement for the claim items that are accepted by the director, and the director shall immediately pay the contractor for any additional compensation resulting from the supplemental agreement. The contractor may demand arbitration on the remaining claim items within ninety days after the contractor has been notified of the director’s action on the claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      The contractor shall make available to the department and allow the department to examine and copy all of the contractor’s records, documents, worksheets, and other data which are pertinent to the justification of the claim and to the substantiation of all costs related to the claim. The department shall also make available to the contractor all of the department’s records, documents, worksheets, and other data which are pertinent to the department’s response to the claim.

   Where work and materials for which contractor sought additional compensation were not part of the original contract language or a modification of the contract between the parties, nor the result of a change order or extra work order by the engineer, contractor was required to give notice under this section, as a prerequisite to claiming additional compensation beyond the contract price, and its failure to give such timely written notice constituted a waiver of its right to claim additional compensation and a failure of the condition precedent to demand arbitration of the matter.

The county must be specified in the submission. The submission must be executed by the director. After submission of the arbitration agreement, the arbitration must proceed in accordance with the provisions of chapter 32-29.3, unless a party submits the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the construction industry arbitration rules of the American arbitration association. If the rules of the American arbitration association conflict with North Dakota law, North Dakota law governs.

       Conditions precedent to demand for arbitration against director.

     </h3>
     <p>
      No right exists to demand arbitration against the director until the conditions specified in this section have been complied with. The contractor shall give the director notice in writing that the contractor claims the contract has been or will be performed fully on a day stated, which may not be less than ten days after the giving of such notice. At the time stated in the notice the director shall cause the work to be inspected, and if the director claims the work has not been completed, the director, with all reasonable dispatch, having regard to the early completion of the work, shall specify the particulars in which it is incomplete and shall direct that it be completed accordingly, or if the director considers further work necessary to bring the project up to the desired standard for acceptance either by the director or the federal highway administration, even though the director considers such contract complete, the director likewise may specify any such additional work. The contractor shall proceed with all reasonable dispatch, having due regard to weather conditions, with the performance of all such additional work with a view to a speedy completion of the project. When the contractor claims in good faith, supported by affidavit furnished to the director, that the contractor has completed such additional work according to the specifications furnished to the contractor, and the director fails for ten days to accept such work as completed, the contractor has the right to institute proceedings under this chapter.

   Statute which provided for one cent tax per gallon of gasoline sold by licensed dealers and its allocation to state highway fund did not violate constitutional provision that all public moneys could be paid out only by legislative appropriation. Department of State Highways v. Baker, 69 N.D. 702, 290 N.W. 257, 1940 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1940).

      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department, whenever needed for the liberty memorial bridge improvement project and the United States highway 2 project improvements, may arrange with any state-owned or private financing agency or underwriter, including the Bank of North Dakota, grant or revenue anticipation financing through the issuance of evidences of indebtedness on such terms and conditions as the department determines if construction funds on hand are insufficient to meet current obligations or to achieve cost-savings or efficiencies in road construction. The department may refund the evidences of indebtedness as often as it is advantageous to do so. Evidences of indebtedness may be sold at public or private sale and must mature not more than fifteen years from their date or dates, and the proceeds of the sale may be invested on such terms and conditions as the department determines. Grant or revenue anticipation financing must be in amounts no larger than can be repaid from moneys known or reasonably anticipated to be due and forthcoming. The grant or revenue anticipation financing may not be used in anticipation of increased federal aid highway grants or increased state highway user revenue funds, and the financing may not be obligated for road construction that cannot be financed from known sources of grants or revenue. The department may pledge any federal aid grants received or to be received for debt service and related issuance costs for evidences of indebtedness issued under this section directly to a trustee in trust for payment to holders of the evidences of indebtedness. The department may also pledge any biennially appropriated revenues for debt service on the evidences of indebtedness directly to a trustee in trust for payment to holders of the evidences of indebtedness. Any evidences of indebtedness issued under this section are not general obligations or debt of the state, the department, or any public officer or employee of the department or this state. The principal of and interest on the evidences of indebtedness are limited obligations payable solely from grants or revenues received or to be received by the department. The department may capitalize from proceeds of the evidences of indebtedness all expenses incidental to issuing the evidences of indebtedness, including any reserves for payment of the evidences of indebtedness.

     <p>
      The director is authorized to establish continuing grants of financial aid for study in undergraduate coursework, which meets the needs and mission of the department, at institutions of higher learning in this state. Expenditure from highway operating funds is authorized. No individual may receive financial aid in any year exceeding the tuition of the institution for which the student is enrolled. The director shall establish the annual expenditure in the department’s budget, which includes individual student financial aid limitations to be determined by the director dependent on the available funds. Before any student shall receive the financial aid authorized by this section, the student shall enter into a contract with the department, which must provide that such student shall upon graduation accept employment with the department for a period of time at least equal to the time the student received financial aid benefits, the salary to be in the grade established for the classification assigned. In the event such student is inducted into the armed forces before graduation, such education may then be completed upon that student’s return to civil life, and in the event such induction into the armed services is made after graduation the employment contract does not take effect until after such period of service in the armed forces has been completed. Leave of absence without pay will be granted to one whose induction occurs during the period of the life of such contract and the employment will be resumed for the balance of the contract period after such employee has been discharged from the service.
     </p>
     <p>
      If such student fails to graduate with a degree, or fails to accept employment with the department as above provided, such student shall repay the department, with interest at the rate of six percent per annum, all sums received by the student in financial aid benefits under the contract herein provided, such repayment to be made within a period equal to the time the student received such benefits. For the purpose of this section, defenses of minority or statute of limitations are removed as to any applicant granted a loan by the director and such contracts are in all respects legal and binding. Salary increases to employees having received financial aid by virtue of this section must be based on the same considerations as other employees employed by the department.
     </p>
     <p>
      The director, with the cooperation and concurrence of the board of higher education, shall prescribe rules for determining the selection of recipients, qualifications, and courses of study. Such rules may cover any areas as may be necessary to assure a source of qualified trained employees for the department.

     <p>
      All highways constructed or reconstructed by the department, board of county commissioners, board of township supervisors, their contractors, subcontractors, or agents, or by any individual firm, corporation, or limited liability company must be so designed as to permit the waters running into the ditches to drain into coulees, rivers, and lakes according to the surface and terrain where the highway or highways are constructed in accordance with the stream crossing standards prepared by the department and the department of water resources so as to avoid the waters flowing into and accumulating in the ditches to overflow adjacent and adjoining lands. In the construction of highways the natural flow and drainage of surface waters to the extent required to meet the stream crossing standards prepared by the department and the department of water resources may not be obstructed, but the water must be permitted to follow the natural course according to the surface and terrain of the particular terrain. The department, county, township, their contractors, subcontractors, or agents, or any individual firm, corporation, or limited liability company is not liable for any damage caused to any structure or property by water detained by the highway at the crossing if the highway crossing has been constructed in accordance with the stream crossing standards prepared by the department and the department of water resources.

       <p>

   A board of township supervisors, not a water resource district, has the authority to install culverts beneath township roads when necessary to preserve the natural drainage of surface waters. Ness v. Ward County Water Resource Dist., 1998 ND 191, 585 N.W.2d 793, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 197</cite> (N.D. 1998).

       <p>

   Township had a duty to construct a culvert in township road so as to prevent obstruction of the natural drainage of surface waters. Kadlec v. Greendale Twp. Bd. of Twp. Supervisors, 1998 ND 165, 583 N.W.2d 817, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 1998), limited, Pembina County Water Res. Bd. v. Cavalier County Water Res. Bd., 2010 ND 148, 787 N.W.2d 295, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>

   Property owner’s petition for writ of mandamus, compelling a township to install a bigger culvert to aid in drainage, was properly denied because, although better drainage could have been provided, the law did not require perfect drainage, and the court found that the rain event, which the owner claimed demonstrated the drainage problems and the failure to meet the stream crossing standards on his property, was a cataclysmic event, and in excess of a 100-year flood, not a 10-year event as contemplated by the stream crossing standards for a township road.

   Eichhorn v. Waldo Twp. Bd. of Supervisors, 2006 ND 214, 723 N.W.2d 112, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 207</cite> (N.D. 2006).

   In constructing relocated grade, county was bound to furnish drainage to adjoining farm, equal to that existing prior to relocation, but it was not under duty to furnish perfect drainage. Little v. Burleigh County, 82 N.W.2d 603, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 1957).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   The County did not abuse its discretion in adopting the flood control plan, and the trial court did not err in ruling the plan complied with the writ of mandamus even though the landowners may have had a “better” plan where the County balanced many considerations, including the safety of persons who use the roads, the amount of road usage, the concerns of upstream and downstream landowners, and the costs of the various plans and available funding.

   Where township was under mandatory injunction to provide for an outlet for surface water restricted by highway construction but failed so to provide in accordance with sound engineering practices, landowners were entitled to an order enforcing the injunction specifically.

   Where a bridge opening had been designed to allow water flow of three thousand cubic feet per second, which was more than adequate for any predictable rainfall within a hundred-year span, but an unprecedented rainfall created a flow of nine thousand cubic feet per second, the resulting damage to plaintiff’s land was not proximately caused by bridge and roadway upstream, even if negligently constructed, but by an act of God for which county and state were not liable.

   When a township road is constructed or reconstructed, this section imposes three obligations on the township board of supervisors: (1) the natural flow and drainage of surface waters must be permitted to follow the natural drainage pattern according to the natural terrain of the land; (2) drainage must be provided for any water that might accumulate in ditches along roadways in order to prevent overflowing onto adjoining lands; and (3) the best method of finding the natural outlet for the surface waters must be determined by the township in accordance with good engineering practices.

     <p>
      Whenever and wherever a highway under the supervision, control, and jurisdiction of the department or under the supervision, control, and jurisdiction of the board of county commissioners of any county or the board of township supervisors has been or will be constructed over a watercourse or draw into which flow surface waters from farmlands, the department of water resources, upon petition of the majority of landowners of the area affected or at the request of the board of county commissioners, township supervisors, or a water resource board, shall determine as nearly as practicable the design discharge that the crossing is required to carry to meet the stream crossing standards prepared by the department and the department of water resources. When the determination has been made by the department of water resources, the department of transportation, the board of county commissioners, or the board of township supervisors, as the case may be, upon notification of the determination, shall install a culvert or bridge of sufficient capacity to permit the water to flow freely and unimpeded through the culvert or under the bridge. The department, county, and township are not liable for any damage to any structure or property caused by water detained by the highway at the crossing if the highway crossing has been constructed in accordance with the stream crossing standards prepared by the department and the department of water resources.

       <p>

   The County did not abuse its discretion in adopting the flood control plan, and the trial court did not err in ruling the plan complied with the writ of mandamus even though the landowners may have had a “better” plan where the County balanced many considerations, including the safety of persons who use the roads, the amount of road usage, the concerns of upstream and downstream landowners, and the costs of the various plans and available funding.

       <p>

   Property owner’s petition for writ of mandamus, compelling a township to install a bigger culvert to aid in drainage, was properly denied because, although better drainage could have been provided, the law did not require perfect drainage, and the court found that the rain event, which the owner claimed demonstrated the drainage problems and the failure to meet the stream crossing standards on his property, was a cataclysmic event, and in excess of a 100-year flood, not a 10-year event as contemplated by the stream crossing standards for a township road.

      Whenever the department or any county or township enters into a contract for the construction and improvement of any road or culvert, or bridge thereon, it, as a condition of such contract, shall provide therein that the contractor shall place warning signs and devices which are in conformity with chapter 39-13.

Property other than motor vehicles left upon highway right of way for a period exceeding seventy-two hours, the ownership of which cannot be determined after reasonable effort has been made to do so, must be deemed abandoned and may be removed from the right of way and stored at the nearest site available for thirty days and if it is not claimed by the owner during such period, and the cost of removal and storage paid, it may be disposed of in the manner prescribed by the director. Abandoned motor vehicles are subject to the provisions of chapter 23.1-15. If such property is disposed of it must, except as otherwise provided by this section, be sold or disposed of in the manner provided in chapter 23.1-15. The receipts therefrom must be deposited in the state treasury as provided in section 1 of article IX of the Constitution of North Dakota and credited to the common schools trust fund unless a commercial towing service lawfully disposes of the abandoned vehicle.

      The county road system must be the roads designated and selected by the boards of county commissioners. The director must be informed of the system so designated. Any changes of the original designation which can be justified and based on new developments must be made by the board of county commissioners and the director must be notified of such changes. In designating and selecting roads on the county road system, the boards of county commissioners of the several counties shall take into account such factors as the actual or potential traffic volumes, the conservation and development of the county’s natural resources, the general economy of the communities, and the desirability of integrating such county roads into the general scheme of the statewide network of county roads.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever any board of county commissioners of any county decides that any county road or roads in such county must be improved or constructed in cooperation with the department, such board shall make written application to the director for the improvement and construction thereof. If the director approves such application, the director, in writing, shall notify the said board of such approval, and at the same time shall submit to the said board an estimate of the cost of such improvement, including the cost of engineering, the purchase or acquirement of right of way, and all other expenses, and the share or portion thereof which such county shall bear. However, the director may not require any county to pay for the cost or expense of acquiring right of way for the state highway system. Whenever the board of county commissioners aforesaid shall elect to proceed with such improvement, the said board shall adopt a resolution signifying such election and in such resolution must set aside out of such funds as are or may become available the amount necessary to pay the county’s share of the cost of such improvement. Upon written demand of the director, the board of county commissioners shall instruct and direct the county auditor by resolution to draw a warrant or warrants on the county treasurer in favor of the contractor, or of the department, for the county’s share of such amount or amounts as may become due during the progress of such improvement. The county shall also draw additional warrants in favor of the department as may be necessary to reimburse it for the county’s share of the cost of engineering and the acquisition of right of way. Such warrants must be drawn by the county treasurer upon the certificate of the director.

      All county and township roads shall be constructed with back sloped grades and ditches. Such grades and ditches shall be sloped to a sufficient degree to permit farm implements used for cutting and gathering hay to operate thereon, and such grades and ditches shall be cleared of all stones or other obstructions that would hinder the operation of such implements. Upon completion of such newly constructed or reconstructed roads, the governing body having authority over such roads shall plant grass upon the back slopes of the grades and ditches. The grass or hay growing upon or within the right of way of such roads may be cut for hay by any owner or tenant of lands adjoining the right of way.

       The governing body of a township or a county may control, or cause to be controlled, grasshoppers and other plant pests which are infesting vegetation in the road rights of way under their authority. Only pesticides that are labeled for use on forage crops may be used so that the forage may be cut and used for hay. At least three days prior to treatment, the governing body of the township or county shall provide written notice to all of the landowners or tenants, or both, of all land adjacent to the rights of way to be treated. The notice must include the approximate date of treatment, the name of the pesticide that will be used, and any restrictions on the harvest and use of the treated forage. If a landowner or occupant of land adjacent to the road right of way to be treated gives notice opposing the treatment to the governing body of the township or county prior to the treatment date that section of the right of way must be excluded from treatment. The landowner or tenant of the land is responsible for clearly marking or flagging the section of the right of way to be excluded from treatment.

       The governing body of a county may enter into agreements with the department of transportation for the purpose of controlling grasshoppers and other plant pests in state highway system rights of way. The governing body of a township may enter into agreements with the governing body of a county for controlling grasshoppers and other plant pests in rights of way of the county road system. The governing body of a county may use the county emergency fund, as provided for in section 57-15-28, to pay for the cost of control in rights of way of the county road system. The county emergency fund may also be used to cost share with townships for control expenses in township rights of way. The electors of an organized township may appropriate funds as provided for in section 57-15-19 for controlling grasshoppers and other plant pests in rights of way controlled by the township.

      A landowner who encroaches upon a county road or its ditches or approaches must be given notice by the board of commissioners for that county that the encroachment has been discovered. If the landowner fails to remedy the encroachment within twenty days after receiving the notice, that landowner is liable to the county for damages resulting from the encroachment. The board of commissioners for that county shall issue to the landowner written notice of the amount of damages determined to be a result of the encroachment. If the landowner fails to pay the county for the damages, the expense of the repair must be charged to the land of the landowner. The expenses charged become a part of the taxes to be levied against the land for the ensuing year and must be collected in the same manner as other real estate taxes are collected and placed to the credit of the county that incurred the expense of the repair.

   Section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-12s24-12-02" target="_self">24-12-02</a></cite>(4) does not limit a board’s authority over a traveled section line by allowing it to be plowed without permission when that activity does not obstruct usual travel.

   Isolated crossing and drainage culvert did not improve section line enough to impose the restrictions against plowing in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-12s24-12-02" target="_self">24-12-02</a></cite>(2). State v. Brossart, 1997 ND 119, 565 N.W.2d 752, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court erred in ruling that a township had no duty of care with regard to a section line because parents alleged that a property owner told two township board members that the section line was in a hazardous or dangerous condition and such allegation was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not the township had actual knowledge of the condition.

      The party with an interest in land adjacent to a township road is not responsible for maintaining that ditch unless improper conservation practices on that party’s adjoining land have led to unreasonable wind and water erosion, not commonly experienced in the locality, which resulted in conditions adversely affecting the ditch. On the occurrence of such improper conservation practices, the board of township supervisors may require the adjoining party with an interest in the land to clean the ditch at that party’s expense. If that party fails to clean the ditch, the procedures applicable to the duty to cut weeds under chapter 63-05 apply with respect to the cleaning of the ditch.

       Maintenance of township road ditches by private party — Power of board of township supervisors — Approval — Standards of construction.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of township supervisors may authorize any private party to maintain, clean, or shape a ditch along a township road at that party’s own expense and in accordance with this section. In maintaining, cleaning, or shaping a ditch, the private party may not spread any soil or debris from that ditch along adjoining land without the permission of all parties with an interest in that land. The ditch may be on a continuous grade from the bottom of the upstream water outlet to the bottom of the downstream water outlet structure. The grade ratio in that distance must be a slope that, in light of the soil types and potential for vegetative cover in the ditch, will resist erosion. In order for any action to be considered maintenance of a ditch in accordance with this section, the ditch must be entirely contained within the township right of way, must have a bottom that is not wider than twelve feet [3.66 meters], and may not alter the side slope of the ditch to a slope steeper than the existing side slope. The board of township supervisors may not approve private maintenance of a ditch that does not comply with the standards of this section. If the board of township supervisors denies permission to maintain a ditch under this section, the petitioner may appeal that decision to the water resource board that has jurisdiction over the ditch. This section does not relieve any person from compliance with any requirements for a drainage permit which are required by statute or rule.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Each overseer of highways having personal knowledge, or on being notified in writing, of any obstruction in the highway or public street in the overseer’s district immediately shall remove or cause any such obstruction to be removed. The overseer’s district may seek recovery of costs incurred for the removal of any obstruction from the individual who is responsible for causing or placing any obstruction in the highway or public street. If the individual responsible is an adjacent landowner, the removal cost may become a part of the taxes to be levied against the landowner for the ensuing year to be collected in the same manner as other real estate taxes are collected.

      <p>

   District court erred in ruling that a township had no duty of care with regard to a section line because parents alleged that a property owner told two township board members that the section line was in a hazardous or dangerous condition and such allegation was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether or not the township had actual knowledge of the condition.

      Whenever a county or township plans to construct or reconstruct a bridge, install or modify a culvert, or construct or reconstruct a drain in connection with a roadway or railway, the county or township shall provide notice in any way to the water resource board of the water resource district in which is located the bridge, culvert, or drain. This notice must be given at least thirty days prior to the date construction or reconstruction is to begin. The water resource board may submit comments concerning the construction or reconstruction to the appropriate officials of the county or township.

   Mere use of land by public as a highway is insufficient of itself to establish a highway by prescription or long use, it not constituting adverse use of the property by the public. Berger v. Berger, 88 N.W.2d 98, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1958).

   Although a railroad right-of-way for an operating railroad line was a public highway under former N.D. Const. art. XII, § 137 (repealed, 2006), the Supreme Court of North Dakota concluded that provision and case law did not preclude an action for an easement by prescription for a public road across a railroad’s spur line under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-07s24-07-01" target="_self">24-07-01</a></cite>.

   The basic requirements for establishing a road by prescription are: 1) general, continuous, uninterrupted, and adverse use of the road; 2) by the public under a claim of right; 3) for a period equal to that for the limitation of real actions, i.e., twenty years. Hartlieb v. Sawyer Township Bd., 366 N.W.2d 486, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 310</cite> (N.D. 1985); Nagel v. Emmons County N.D.

   Landowners’ rights were fully protected by blended eminent domain and road closure proceedings, and the district court did not err in its legal analysis of the effect of the road closure proceeding and its determination of the public necessity for the taking of the property.

   Defendant’s conviction for obstructing a public road, section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-12s24-12-02" target="_self">24-12-02</a></cite>, was reversed, where alleged road in question was allegedly acquired by prescription, was not declared to be a public road until date of conviction at criminal trial, and there was a legitimate dispute as to whether or not necessary elements had been met to establish a public road by prescription; proper procedure to determine if a public road has been established by prescription is a civil action.

   To establish a highway by prescription there must have been general, continuous, uninterrupted, and adverse use by the public under a claim of right, for a period of twenty years. Berger v. Berger, 88 N.W.2d 98, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1958).
       </p>
       <p>

   County obtained a prescriptive easement and a road was declared to be public in nature because the requirements of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-07s24-07-01" target="_self">24-07-01</a></cite> were satisfied; the prescriptive period commenced when the county constructed the road in the early 1950s, and the construction and maintenance of the road supported the finding of adverse use, but a remand was necessary to determine a description of the prescriptive road. There was evidence in the record to support the trial court’s findings about the temporary use of gates and their effect on adverse public use; however, an owner was not entitled to damages for inverse condemnation because the road became a public road before she obtained an interest in the land.

   McKenzie County v. Reichman, 2012 ND 20, 812 N.W.2d 332, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2012).

   Where owner of land recognized the existence of a trail across his land and, upon survey to construct a road along such trail, the course of the road was moved at his request, he cannot later assert that the trail was not continuously used or that it did not follow a definite course. Berger v. Morton County, 57 N.D. 305, 221 N.W. 270, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 1928).

   Where highway was established by prescription, the public acquired only an easement of passage, and all other interest in the property remained in the owner of the fee. Casey v. Corwin, 71 N.W.2d 553, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite> (N.D. 1955).

   A county tax deed to a parcel of property does not extinguish a public roadway established by prescription on an adjoining parcel of property; such road is established by the public for the public’s use, and the circumstances relating to the title to adjoining property have no effect on this use.

   Hostile use of road over private land necessary to establish prescriptive right means a use inconsistent with owner’s right to exclusive use, does not imply enmity or ill will, and is consistent with friendly relations between user of road and landowner.

   A jury’s role in both an eminent domain and a road closure proceeding is limited to a determination of a landowner’s damages; therefore, it was not error for landowners to be prevented from presenting evidence to the jury on the necessity for a road closure as the issue of necessity for a particular taking ultimately remains a question for a court to review. Gissel v. Kenmare Township, 512 N.W.2d 470, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1994).

   Erection of gate or gates across road evidences an intention on part of owner to assert ownership and possession of land over which the road runs. Berger v. Berger, 88 N.W.2d 98, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1958).
       </p>

   The existence of a gate across a road is indicative that use of the road by others is permissive rather than adverse. Mohr v. Tescher, 313 N.W.2d 737, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 357</cite> (N.D. 1981).

   A public highway need not be opened by officials, but the people may open it themselves by taking possession and using it. Kritzberger v. Traill County, 62 N.D. 208, 242 N.W. 913, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1932).

   Where no evidence of hostile use of road which was used only for going upon land and not to travel across it was shown to exist before defendant’s father acquired land and his use of road thereafter was permissive, no road was established by prescription. Trautman v. Ahlert, 147 N.W.2d 407, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1966).
       </p>
       <p>

   Whether or not use has been permissible is an essential element in establishing a road by prescription. Hartlieb v. Sawyer Township Bd., 366 N.W.2d 486, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 310</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where a neighboring property owner used a railroad company’s grade crossing to access its land until the railroad company closed the crossing grade and the property owner filed suit to compel the reopening of the grade by claiming that a public road by prescription had been established, the trial court did not err in rendering judgment in favor of the railroad company because the property owner’s use of the crossing grade was a use permitted by the railroad company; because a permissive use was not one hostile to the rights of the owner of the land, it could not ripen into title through prescription.

   There were genuine issues of material fact as to whether a public road by prescription existed because an owner alleged that the road was used with the permission of the landowners, which raised an issue of whether the use of the road was permissive, rather than adverse.

The district court erred in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss and motion for judgment of acquittal, because there existed a legitimate dispute as to whether the road upon which he was alleged to have trespassed became a public road by prescription under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-07s24-07-01" target="_self">24-07-01</a></cite>.

       <p>

   If the owner of land permits a public highway to be established by prescription, it is assumed he intends road of statutory width, and the erection of a fence cannot affect width of road acquired before the fence was built. Kritzberger v. Traill County, 62 N.D. 208, 242 N.W. 913 (1932), explained, Small v. Burleigh County, 225 N.W.2d 295 (N.D. 1974), decided prior to the enactment of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-01s24-01-01.1" target="_self">24-01-01.1</a></cite>.

   The width of a prescriptive public road established in the absence of a law specifying its width is determined from the extent of the actual use of the property for roadway purposes over the prescriptive period; such width is not limited to the actual traveled surface areas of the roadway, but includes adjacent land such as ditches, shoulders, and slopes that are reasonably necessary for the prescription to be maintained as a public road. Keidel v. Rask, 290 N.W.2d 255, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1980).

   The width of a prescriptive public road includes the portion of the road actually traveled as well as the shoulders and ditches that are needed and have actually been used to support and maintain the traveled portion.

   action against defendants claiming that defendants improperly denied them access to their farmland, the trial court did not err in finding a road running through defendants’

   property to be a public highway because it was established by the county board of commissioners; there was no evidence in the record that the road had been formally discontinued by the county board of commissioners.

     </p>
     <p>
      The board of county commissioners, if petitioned by a person having an interest in the adjoining land or a portion thereof, after public hearing and a finding by the commissioners of public benefit, may close section lines or portions thereof which are not used for ten years, are not traveled due to natural obstacles or difficulty of terrain, are not required due to readily accessible alternate routes of travel, or are intersected by interstate highways causing the section line to be a deadend, providing the closing of the dead-end section line does not deprive adjacent landowners access to the landowners’ property. After the section lines are closed, they may be used to the benefit of the adjacent landowners. However, survey or property reference monuments may not be disturbed, removed, or destroyed. If drainage is interfered with due to the farming operations, alternate means of drainage must be provided for by the landowners or tenants farming the lands.

   Order of board of supervisors attempting to locate and establish a highway along the section line was unnecessary unless it became necessary to deviate from the section line. Huffman v. Board of Supervisors, 47 N.D. 217, 182 N.W. 459, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1921).

   In plaintiffs’

   action against defendants claiming that defendants improperly denied them access to their farmland, the trial court did not err in finding a road running through defendants’

   property to be a public highway because it was established by the county board of commissioners; there was no evidence in the record that the road had been formally discontinued by the county board of commissioners.

     <p>
      A person having a surface interest in a parcel of land connected by a section line to another parcel of land in which that person has a surface interest or to a highway may petition the board of county commissioners in an unorganized township or the board of township supervisors in an organized township to authorize the petitioner to improve the section line or a portion of the section line for the purpose of travel for agricultural purposes. The petition may be approved if the section line cannot be traveled due to natural obstacles or difficulty of terrain and if the petitioner does not have a readily accessible alternative route of travel to the parcel of land. The petitioner must improve the section line or a portion of the section line at the petitioner’s expense.

      Whenever any tract of land is surveyed or sold in tracts less than the original subdivision as established by the government survey thereof, so that any part thereof does not touch upon a public road so as to allow the owner of such tract access to a public highway, the board of county commissioners or board of township supervisors, upon petition of such owner, may open a public road to gain access to any such tract or tracts when in the judgment of such board such public road is necessary and that it is of sufficient benefit to the county or township as a whole, but no such public road may exceed two rods [10.06 meters] in width unless in the judgment of such board a roadway of such width is not sufficient to accommodate the travel thereon.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever a petition is received by the board having jurisdiction, requiring a new road to be laid out, said board, when in its judgment circumstances warrant the same, shall employ a competent surveyor to survey and lay out said road, and such survey must include a line of levels to be run over the laid out road and a grade line to be established thereon, such grade line not to be greater than ten percent when completed. In laying out said road the board may deviate or depart, or may direct a deviation or departure, from the road described in the petition when it is practicable and less expensive to do so in order to obtain a grade line not exceeding ten percent. Such surveyor shall prepare a plan and profile of the surveyor’s survey and shall file a copy of the same with the township clerk or the county auditor, as the case may be, and the board having jurisdiction shall require that such road, when completed, must conform to the plan and profile of the surveyor as filed with the township clerk or county auditor.

     <p>
      Whenever the board of county commissioners or the board of township supervisors shall lay out, alter, or discontinue any highway, it shall cause a survey thereof to be made when necessary, and it shall make out an accurate description of the highway so altered, discontinued, or laid out, and shall incorporate the same in an order to be signed by the members of such board, and shall cause such order, together with all the petitions and affidavits of service and posting of notices to be filed in the office of the county auditor, if by the board of county commissioners, and in the office of the township clerk, if by the board of township supervisors. The auditor or clerk shall note the time of filing the same. On the refusal of either board to lay out, alter, or discontinue a road, it shall note the fact on the back of the petition and file the same as aforesaid. All orders, petitions, and affidavits, together with the award of damages, must be made out and filed within five days after the date of the order for laying out, altering, or discontinuing a highway. But the county auditor or township clerk may not record such order within thirty days, nor until a final decision is had, and not then unless such order is confirmed. When the order, together with the award, has been recorded by the county auditor or township clerk, as the case may require, the same must be filed in the office of the county auditor. In case the board having jurisdiction fails to file such order within twenty days, it must be deemed to have decided against such application.

       Damages — How ascertained.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The damages sustained by reason of laying out, altering, or discontinuing any road may be ascertained by the agreement of the owners and the board of county commissioners or the board of township supervisors, as the case may be, and unless such agreement is made, or the owners in writing shall release all claim to damages, the same must be assessed in the manner herein prescribed before the road is opened, worked, or used. Every agreement and release must be filed in the township clerk’s office, when with a township, and in the county auditor’s office, when with a county, and precludes such owners of land forever from all further claim for damages. In case the board and the owners of land claiming damages cannot agree, or if the owner of any land through which any highway shall be laid out, altered, or discontinued, is unknown, the board in its award of damages shall specify the amount of damages awarded to each such owner, giving a brief description of such parcel of land in the award. The board having jurisdiction shall assess the damages at what it deems just and right to each individual claimant with whom it cannot agree. The board of township supervisors shall deposit a statement of the amount of damages assessed with the township clerk, and the board of county commissioners shall deposit the same with the county auditor. The auditor or clerk shall note the time of filing the same. The board in assessing damages shall estimate the advantages and benefits the new road or alteration of an old one will confer on the claimant for the same as well as the disadvantages. Any person living on land belonging to the United States who has made that person’s declaratory statement for the same in the proper land office, for all the purposes of this chapter, must be considered the owner of such lands.

       Repair of highways across railroads, canals, or ditches.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever highways are laid out across railroads, canals, or ditches on public lands, the owners at their own expense shall so repair their railroads, canals, or ditches that the public highway may cross the same without damage or delay, and when the right of way for a public highway is obtained through the judgment of any court, over any railroad, canal, or ditch, no damages must be awarded for the simple right to cross the same.

   Statute was inapplicable because a property owner's land was taken by a township, not a county, and the township did not claim to take the property using quick take procedures but used N.D.C.C. ch. 24-07 to establish the need for and value of the land; the process and procedures in ch. 24-07 did not authorize the township to effectuate quick take condemnation or to take possession of the owner's property before actually paying him for the taking.

      An appeal as provided for in this chapter brings before the appellate court the propriety of the amount of damages allowed and all matters referred to in the notice of appeal. The court or jury, as the case may be, shall reassess the damages. The rules for ascertaining and fixing the damages must be based upon the principles which the board was required to adopt in originally determining the same.

       When appeal sustained — Duty of the board.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When an appeal has been made from the determination of any board of township supervisors or board of county commissioners, and such determination has been reversed or altered, the board from whose determination such appeal was taken shall proceed to lay out, alter, or discontinue such highway, in conformity with the decision of such appeal, and the proceedings thereon must be the same as if the board originally had determined to lay out, alter, or discontinue such highway. The amount of damages finally determined and awarded by the board or by the court or jury, together with all the charges of officers and other persons necessarily employed in laying out, altering, or discontinuing any township or county road, must be audited by the board of county commissioners or board of township supervisors, as the case may be, specifying the amount of charges and damages due each individual, and the respective amounts must be certified by said board and by it deposited with the county auditor or township clerk and paid by the county or township, as the case may be. Before any road may be opened or used, warrants of the county or township, as the case may be, equal to the damages assessed to individuals, must be issued and deposited with the county auditor or township clerk, as the case may be, for the use and benefit of said individuals, and must be delivered to them on demand. The issuing and depositing of said warrants must be deemed to be sufficient security for the payment of said damages. In no case may a township be compelled to pay any damages that may be awarded in laying out, altering, or discontinuing any county road.

   Where right of way was acquired by prescription and later relocated by state highway department, nonuse for period required to establish highway would have extinguished prescriptive right. Casey v. Corwin, 71 N.W.2d 553, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite> (N.D. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>

   Summary judgment was inappropriately granted in favor of the township on the landowner’s action to quiet title to an easement where some affiants claimed to have used the road in question over the past several decades, while another affiant claimed the road went unused for a period of approximately 15 years; when a trial court was presented with “battling affidavits,” wrought with concerns over witness credibility, summary judgment was improper, and given that N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-07s24-07-31" target="_self">24-07-31</a></cite> required a 10-year period of non-use, the dispute involved an issue of material fact rendering summary judgment inappropriate.

       Designation of minimum maintenance road.

     <p>
      A board having jurisdiction as described in this chapter, and the governing body of a city, may designate a road under its jurisdiction as a minimum maintenance road in accordance with sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-07s24-07-35" target="_self">24-07-35</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-07s24-07-37" target="_self">24-07-37</a></cite>. The designation may be made only if the board or governing body determines that the road to be so designated is used only occasionally or intermittently for passenger and commercial travel. Further, the designation cannot be made if the road is used as a schoolbus route, mail route, or as the only access to any existing residence. In its action designating the minimum maintenance road, the board or governing body shall identify the beginning and end of the road. The board or governing body shall notify each adjoining political subdivision of a designation made under this section. If a road runs along the boundary of political subdivisions, the designation as a minimum maintenance road is not applicable unless the board or governing body of each adjoining political subdivision agrees with the designation.

      A road is not eligible for designation as a minimum maintenance road if federal highway aid to this state would be reduced as a result of that designation. A road is not eligible for that designation if additional right of way or easement by eminent domain is required for constructing or designating the road as a minimum maintenance road, unless the consent of the landowner is given or the designation is necessary for drainage or public safety.

       Construction of bridges by board of county commissioners — Petition — Bids — Rejection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever a majority of the freeholders of a civil township, or a majority of the freeholders living within a radius of three miles [4.83 kilometers] of the proposed location, petition the board of county commissioners for a bridge at a specified location within such township, or within any incorporated city, if the cost of the bridge exceeds the sum of five hundred dollars, the board of county commissioners shall view and investigate the necessity of the proposed bridge. If the board approves the petition, it shall proceed to advertise in the official newspaper of the county, for a period of thirty days, the plans and specifications of the proposed bridge, asking for sealed bids for the building of such bridge, to be submitted to it at the next regular or special meeting, at which the board shall proceed to examine all proposals or bids for the building of such bridge. The board shall award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder, requiring the bidder to give a bond in a sum not less than the amount stipulated in the bid or contract, conditioned for the faithful compliance with the terms of the bid or contract, the bond to be approved by the board and filed in the office of the county auditor but the board may reject all bids. If all bids are rejected, the board shall readvertise as provided herein. Provided, however, that if the amount of the lowest responsible bid is less than fifteen thousand dollars, the board may refuse all bids received and proceed to construct the bridge under its own supervision as it deems most expedient and may enter into contracts for the labor or material to be used in the construction of the bridge.

At the time appointed for the hearing of the petition, the board of county commissioners shall investigate the need for such bridge, and if it finds the same to be necessary and that the consent of the federal government has been obtained to span such river, it, by resolution duly entered upon the minutes of the board, shall appropriate toward the building of such bridge, from the county treasury, a sum not exceeding one-half of the estimated cost of the bridge. The appropriation must be upon condition that a sufficient bond be given, conditioned that the remaining one-half or more, as the case may be, of the cost of the bridge will be paid.

       Standard railroad crossing warning systems — Survey for additional warning systems.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The standard warning system at each public highway-railroad grade crossing must be railroad crossbucks and advance warning signs designed and located pursuant to section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.39.html#t39c39-13s39-13-07" target="_blank">39-13-07</a></cite>. These signing requirements and standards must be deemed adequate and appropriate for warning of the existence and nature of each railroad crossing for all purposes whatsoever. However, because of the availability of substantial federal funds, and for the purpose of promoting the additional safety and general welfare of the motoring public, and railroad employees, and to secure the practical and orderly development of additional warning systems beyond the standards herein, and to enable the various jurisdictional authorities to implement existing statutes authorizing the determination of need and selection of additional warning systems, and within the practical limitations of time and available public funds, the department shall conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all streets and highways as required by the Federal Highway Safety Act of 1973, to identify those railroad crossings which may need additional warning systems beyond the standard crossbucks and advance warning signs. To implement such survey and to make the determination of need and selection of additional warning systems, the department may screen, rate, and prioritize said crossings for additional warning systems and establish an installation program. In order to foster additional warning systems beyond the standards herein or improvements thereto, where such additional warnings or improvements thereto are deemed necessary by any jurisdictional authority either under this statute or any other statutes, neither the actions, proceedings, findings, or orders of any jurisdictional authority, nor the actions of the railroad regarding such additional warning or improvements thereto, prior to installation and operation thereof, are admissible in evidence in any civil action for personal injury, death, or damage to property arising out of a public highway-railroad crossing accident.

   Trial court erred in dismissing an action against a railroad seeking an injunction and damages relating to the closing of a grade crossing without notice because the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act of 1995 did not explicitly preempt state law concerning grade crossings in 49 U.S.C.S. § 10501(b).

      In order to promote public safety at intersections of railroad lines and all classes of highways, the department shall apportion the cost of automatic grade crossing protection devices in accordance with this section. In the event that the commission in accordance with the provisions of section 24-09-08 orders that any grade crossing must be protected by automatic grade crossing protection devices, the commission shall in its order apportion the cost thereof between the railroad interested, the political subdivision having jurisdiction of the highway involved, and the state of North Dakota. Such cost must be apportioned to such parties or to any one or more of such parties on the basis of the benefit derived respectively by highway users and the railroad from the installation of such crossing protection device. For the purpose of this section, the cost attributable to the benefit of the highway users must be apportioned to the state of North Dakota or to the political subdivision having jurisdiction of the highway involved or to both of such parties. The cost apportioned to the state of North Dakota must be paid out of the highway fund in the state treasury, provided that not more than one hundred thousand dollars may be expended for this purpose in any one biennium.

     <p>
      It is in the interest of public safety to eliminate unnecessary railroad grade crossings whenever reasonable access can be safely provided at another crossing. Whenever it is desired, either by the public officials having the necessary authority or by the railway company operating the railroad, to establish, vacate, or relocate any crossing of a public highway and a railroad, or to separate grades, and an agreement cannot be reached between the public official and the railway company, either as to the necessity for establishing, vacating, or relocating a crossing or for separating grades, as to place, manner of construction, or a reasonable division of the expense, either party may file a petition with the commission, setting forth the facts and submitting the matter to it for determination. The commission, after giving notice as it shall deem reasonable, shall conduct a hearing and shall issue its order determining whether there should be an establishment, vacation, or relocation of the crossing in question, or a separation of grades, and dividing the expense of the establishment, relocation, or separation of grades. Irrespective of the establishment, relocation, or the consideration of further reasonable protection of a crossing, if the commission finds any railroad crossing to be unnecessary or unsafe, it shall order the crossing closed after reasonable notice and hearing. Whenever a final order is entered vacating or closing a crossing, it must be vacated or closed at the railroad company’s expense.

      Before any cattle guard and gateway may be erected across any highway or section line as authorized in section 24-10-01, the board of county commissioners or board of township supervisors, as the case may be, shall approve written specifications of the cattle guard and gateway. Specifications approved by the board of county commissioners must be filed with the county auditor and specifications approved by the board of township supervisors must be filed with the township clerk. The specifications must include requirements for warning signs to be placed approximately three hundred feet [91.44 meters] from and plainly visible to persons approaching the cattle guard upon the highway or section line. A cattle guard must be so constructed as to permit the passage of motor vehicles through and over the same. No cattle guard may be erected upon any highway or section line unless there also is provided adjacent thereto an ample gateway in which must be erected a gate which may be opened easily and closed by the public. The person who applied for permission to erect the cattle guard shall maintain the cattle guard and gateway, unless application is otherwise assigned. Within the limits of an enclosure so completed by authorized cattle guards erected in accordance with such specifications, livestock must be permitted to run at large without liability for being upon the highway or section line.

   To support a verdict for damages for obstructing a highway, there must be evidence connecting the defendant with the unlawful act. Kuhnert v.

   Fact that drive-in theater’s light post and fence were situated on highway right of way did not establish injury or obstruction; injunction for their removal was denied. Hjelle v. J. C. Snyder &amp; Sons, 133 N.W.2d 625, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1965).

       <p>

   Conclusion farmer did not violate this section by plowing section line did not wholly acquit him, because trial court did not instruct jury on subsection (2) and there was evidence farmer parked machinery on section line or otherwise acted to obstruct usual travel from which jury might properly have convicted him, and he would be retried with jury properly instructed. State v. Brossart, 1997 ND 119, 565 N.W.2d 752, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Defendant was convicted of criminal trespass under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.12.1.html#t12c12.1-01c12.1-22s12.1-22-03" target="_blank">12.1-22-03</a></cite>, based on allegations that he drove his vehicle on his ex-wife’s property and damaged flax planted over the passable portion of the section line; the district court erred in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal, because there existed a legitimate dispute as to whether the road upon which he was alleged to have trespassed became a public road by prescription. The section line road had never been closed under a proceeding permitted by statute; in addition, his ex-wife barricaded, plowed up, and planted over the established section line road despite the statutory prohibitions against all these acts under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-12s24-12-02" target="_self">24-12-02</a></cite>.

   State v. Herzig, 2012 ND 247, 825 N.W.2d 235, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 2012).

         Public Road by Prescription.

       </h5>
       <p>

   Defendant’s conviction for obstructing a public road was reversed, where alleged road in question was allegedly acquired by prescription, was not declared to be a public road until date of conviction at criminal trial, and there was a legitimate dispute as to whether or not necessary requirements had been met to establish a public road by prescription; proper procedure to determine if a public road has been established by prescription is a civil action. State v. Meyer, 361 N.W.2d 221, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   County obtained a prescriptive easement and a road was declared to be public in nature because the requirements of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-07s24-07-01" target="_self">24-07-01</a></cite> were satisfied; the prescriptive period commenced when the county constructed the road in the early 1950s, and the construction and maintenance of the road supported the finding of adverse use, but a remand was necessary to determine a description of the prescriptive road. There was evidence in the record to support the trial court’s findings about the temporary use of gates and their effect on adverse public use; however, an owner was not entitled to damages for inverse condemnation because the road became a public road before she obtained an interest in the land.

   McKenzie County v. Reichman, 2012 ND 20, 812 N.W.2d 332, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2012).

         Section Line.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   This section was not applicable to a fence and gate built by property owner on a section line where, under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t24c24-07s24-07-03" target="_self">24-07-03</a></cite>, the section line was not considered a public road and it was not a well-traveled trail. De Lair v. County of La Moure, 326 N.W.2d 55, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 333</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   Section applied to section lines. State v. Silseth, 399 N.W.2d 868, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   A section line is a “public highway or right of way” under this section. State v. Silseth, 399 N.W.2d 868, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section unambiguously proscribes plowing of a section line, irrespective of whether or to what degree that action obstructs the section line. State v. Silseth, 399 N.W.2d 868, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   By enacting this section, the legislature has declared that plowing a section line constitutes interference with the public’s easement for travel. State v. Silseth, 399 N.W.2d 868, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   Farmer is not required to request permission from township board before plowing unimproved, though traveled, section line. State v. Brossart, 1997 ND 119, 565 N.W.2d 752, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Subsection (4) does not limit a township board’s authority over a traveled section line by allowing it to be plowed without permission when that activity does not obstruct usual travel. State v. Brossart, 1997 ND 119, 565 N.W.2d 752, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Subsection (4) is intended to permit plowing of unimproved and traveled section lines if it does not “obstruct usual travel,” while continuing the prohibition against plowing along improved public highways. State v. Brossart, 1997 ND 119, 565 N.W.2d 752, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Isolated crossing and drainage culvert did not improve section line enough to impose the restrictions against plowing in subsection (2). State v. Brossart, 1997 ND 119, 565 N.W.2d 752, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1997).

   While this section does not provide the director of DOT with exclusive enforcement authority to enforce N.D.C.C. ch. 24-16, other statutes relating to public nuisances provide that a public nuisance may be abated by any public body or officer, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.42.html#t42c42-01s42-01-09" target="_blank">42-01-09</a></cite>, and by a state’s attorney, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.42.html#t42c42-02s42-02-01" target="_blank">42-02-01</a></cite>; therefore, appellate court concluded that the DOT director had authority to sue junkyard owner to abate the public nuisance created by his junkyard and auto graveyard.

      Junkyards lawfully in existence prior to December 3, 1965, which are or may be screened by natural objects, plantings, fences, or other appropriate means so as not to be visible from the main traveled way of the state highway system must be allowed to remain within one thousand feet [304.8 meters] of the nearest edge of the right of way of any state highway; provided, however, that the owners of the junkyards which are not effectively screened shall take all the steps ordered by the commissioner to effectively screen them. When ordered by the director to screen junkyards lawfully in existence prior to December 3, 1965, the owners must be fully reimbursed for the costs expended pursuant to the director’s order and design. Should the director determine that the effective screening of any junkyard could best be done by state forces or by an independent contractor, the director may use state forces or may let a contract for the screening in the same manner that contracts are let pursuant to this title for construction and reconstruction of the state highway system and the director has the right to enter upon private property for the purpose of screening said junkyards without liability on the director’s part.

        Junkyard Not Allowed.

      </p>
      <p>

   Although counties have general authority to enact zoning ordinances, a local governing body cannot validly enact a zoning ordinance that contravenes federal or state law; thus, while defendant’s junkyard may not violate any of the County’s zoning ordinances, being in compliance with county ordinances does not mean “zoned under authority of state law”, and therefore, the junkyard did not fall into the exception provided under this section.

      It is hereby declared to be in the public interest reasonably to regulate advertising devices along the highways hereinafter specified while, at the same time, recognizing that both the convenience of travel and the interests of the economy as a whole require a reasonable freedom to advertise. It is the intention of the legislative assembly in this chapter to provide a statutory basis for the reasonable regulation, but not the prohibition, of outdoor advertising through zoning principles and standards consistent with the public policy relating to the areas adjacent to the state highway system pursuant to 23 U.S.C. 131 and 23 U.S.C. 319 and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. It is further declared to be in the public interest to review all rights now acquired by the state of North Dakota for the use and benefit of the department of transportation pertaining to the right and control over the erection, location, or maintenance of billboards, signs, or any form of advertising adjacent to the state highway system, to determine and designate such areas adjacent to the state highway system as are necessary for the restoration, preservation, and enhancement of scenic beauty and to vacate to the owner such property rights acquired in areas not so determined and designated.

Owners of advertising structures, signs, displays, or devices acquired by the director pursuant to this section, and the owners of the land upon which such displays are located must be paid just compensation for the reasonable damages, if any, suffered by the reason of such removal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Just compensation must be paid upon the removal of any outdoor advertising sign, display, or device lawfully erected and maintained under state law, provided that federal matching funds are appropriated, allotted, and made available to this state under title 23, United States Code, for the purpose of providing just compensation for the removal of such signs, displays, or devices. A municipality, county or local zoning authority, or political subdivision may not remove or cause to be removed any advertising structures, except such structures that encroach upon the right of way, without paying compensation in accordance with this section.
