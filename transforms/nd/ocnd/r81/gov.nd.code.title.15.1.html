       Provide a clearinghouse for information on matters relating to education problems and how they are being met in different places throughout the nation, so that the executive and legislative branches of state government and of local communities may have ready access to the experience and record of the entire country, and so that both lay and professional groups in the field of education may have additional avenues for the sharing of experience and the interchange of ideas in the formation of public policy in education.

      <li id="t15c15.1-04s15.1-04-01ol14">
       Facilitate the improvement of state and local education systems so that all of them will be able to meet adequate and desirable goals in a society that requires continuous qualitative and quantitative advances in educational opportunities, methods, and facilities.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      <b>
       B.
      </b>
      It is the policy of this compact to encourage and promote local and state initiatives in the development, maintenance, improvement, and administration of education systems and institutions in a manner that will accord with the needs and advantages of diversity among localities and states.

      </b>
      The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states, as well as in the excellence of its own education system and institutions, because of the highly mobile character of individuals within the nation, and because the products and services contributing to the health, welfare, and economic advancement of each state are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states.

       THE COMMISSION
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       A.
      </b>
      The education commission of the states, hereinafter called “the commission”, is hereby established. The commission consists of seven members representing each party state. One of the members must be the governor and two must be members of the state legislative assembly selected by its respective houses. The governor shall appoint the remaining four members, all of whom serve at the pleasure of the governor. If the laws of a state prevent legislators from serving on the commission, the governor shall appoint six members, all of whom shall serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide. In addition to any other principles or requirements that a state may establish for the appointment and service of its members on the commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the commission from each party state is that the members representing the state must, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge, or affiliations, be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the state government, higher education, the state education system, local education, and lay and professional, as well as public and nonpublic educational leadership. Of those appointees, one must be the head of a state agency or institution, designated by the governor, having responsibility for one or more programs of public education. In addition to the members of the commission representing the party states, there may not be more than ten nonvoting commissioners selected by the steering committee for terms of one year. The nonvoting commissioners shall represent leading national organizations of professional educators or individuals concerned with educational administration.

      </b>
      The members of the commission are entitled to one vote each on the commission.

Action of the commission may be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners are present. The commission shall meet at least once a year. In its bylaws, and subject to any directions and limitations contained in the bylaws, the commission may delegate the exercise of its powers to the steering committee or the executive director, except for the power to approve budgets or requests for appropriations, the power to make policy recommendations pursuant to Article IV, and the adoption of the annual report pursuant to this article.

Any donation or grant accepted by the commission or services borrowed pursuant to this article must be reported in the annual report of the commission. The report must include the nature, amount, and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant, or services borrowed, and the identity of the donor or lender.

      <b>
       3.

      Within thirty days after a rule is adopted, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of the petition does not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the commission’s authority.

      If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall terminate from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact are terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default, except that in the event of a default by this state, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its most recent annual assessment.

      The state that has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination, to a maximum of five thousand dollars multiplied by the number of years that the state has been a member of the compact. In the event that this state is suspended or terminated, its total financial responsibility is limited to the amount of its most recent annual assessment.

   Although not one of the various statutes for distributing funding for primary or secondary education, by itself, is unconstitutional, nor does the constitution require equal dollar funding per pupil throughout the state, where the impact of the distribution of funding did not bear a close correspondence to the goals of providing an equal educational opportunity and of supporting elementary and secondary education from state funds based on educational costs per pupil, the overall impact of the entire statutory method for distributing funding for education in North Dakota was held unconstitutional.

   A statute providing for the transportation of pupils of consolidated schools does not deprive children or guardians of constitutional rights merely because an option to furnish transportation or pay compensation lies in the discretion of the board or the judgment of the people.

      If a tribal government has prescribed by tribal law or resolution qualifications for eligibility for public office relating to criminal convictions which are more restrictive than the laws of this state, the qualifications for eligibility for membership of a public school board of a school district located on tribal land may not be less restrictive than the qualifications for eligibility prescribed by tribal law or resolution for public office relating to criminal convictions. For purposes of this section, “tribal land” means that portion of the land within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation which is located in the state.

       A school board by resolution may change the terms of office for its members from three to four years. The resolution must provide that upon the expiration of each member’s current three-year term, the term of office for that position on the board will become four years. The resolution may provide for the conversion of one position to a two-year term and, thereafter, to a four-year term. If the resolution so provides, the term must be chosen by lot. If as a result of an extension to four years a term would conclude in an odd-numbered year, the resolution must provide for one transitional three-year term before the four-year term commences.

     <p>
      The superintendent of public instruction may not impose through the accreditation process any penalties or sanctions on a school district for employing a superintendent jointly with one or more other districts.

       Student financial institution.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A school board may establish, maintain, and supervise a student financial institution which is not subject to section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.06.html#t06c6-02s6-02-01" target="_blank">6-02-01</a></cite>, <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.06.html#t06c6-02s6-02-03" target="_blank">6-02-03</a></cite>, <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.06.html#t06c6-03s6-03-67.1" target="_blank">6-03-67.1</a></cite>, or <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.06.html#t06c6-06s6-06-05" target="_blank">6-06-05</a></cite> or any other statute or rule that regulates banks, other financial institutions, or currency exchanges. To qualify as a student financial institution, the student financial institution must be operated as part of a high school educational program under guidelines adopted by the school board, be advised on a regular basis by one or more state-chartered or federally chartered financial institutions including credit unions, but not owned or operated by a financial institution, be located on school premises and have as customers only students enrolled in, or employees of, the school of which it is located, and have a written commitment from the school board guaranteeing reimbursement of any depositor’s funds lost due to insolvency of the student financial institution. Funds of a student financial institution that meet the requirements of this section are not school district or other public funds for purposes of any state law governing the use or investment of school district or other public funds. For purposes of borrowing money, cashing checks, and taking deposits concerning the operation of a student financial institution, the obligations of a minor have the same force and effect as though they were the obligations of a person over the age of majority.

        Election.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   “Elected” as used in this section means the election of a successor who is qualified for the office. Jenness v. Clark, 21 N.D. 150, 129 N.W. 357, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1910).

        Professional Certificate.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   An attack on the title to office of a county superintendent of schools is a collateral attack on a second grade professional certificate. Wendt v. Waller, 46 N.D. 268, 176 N.W. 930, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1920).

      </p>
      <p>

   Relator holding certificate of election, who had duly qualified for the office of county superintendent of schools, had the prima facie right to the office in an action of mandamus. State ex rel. Butler v. Callahan, 4 N.D. 481, 61 N.W. 1025, 1895 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1895).

        Term of Office.

       The term of office of the county superintendent of schools continues for such additional time as may elapse before his successor is elected and qualified. State v. Fabrick, 16 N.D. 94, 112 N.W. 74 (1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Title to Office.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   The title to the office of county superintendent of schools based upon improper educational certificate cannot be litigated in an action to compel surrender to plaintiff possession of the office. State ex rel. Butler v. Callahan, 4 N.D. 481, 61 N.W. 1025, 1895 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>

   Qualification and title of defendant is not before the court in a proceeding to contest the election and determine plaintiff’s right to the office of county superintendent of schools. Woll v. Jensen, 36 N.D. 250, 162 N.W. 403, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1917).

       <p>

   In an annexation dispute, a constitutionality argument was rejected since the catch-all provision in this statute allowing consideration of “all other relevant factors” was not vague and did not amount to an improper delegation of legislative authority to the State Board of Public School Education. In re A Part of Lewis &amp; Clark Pub. Sch. Dist. #161 of Ward v. State Bd. of Pub. Sch. Educ. of N.D., 2016 ND 41, 876 N.W.2d 40, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 2016).

       <p>

   In an annexation dispute, the State Board of Public School Education did not err in considering the amount of land involved in the annexation petition because a “catch-all” provision was sufficiently broad to include the amount of land, and there was no evidence that the Board applied this factor in an “ad hoc” or “discriminatory” fashion.

        Effect of Approval.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Disapproval of an annexation petition by one of two or more county committees cannot prevent annexation, for approval by one county committee results in submission of the matter to the state board of public school education and state board approval has the same effect as approval by all county committees. In re Annexation of Part of Donnybrook Pub. Sch. Dist., 365 N.W.2d 514, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 279</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   An equitable adjustment as contemplated does not necessarily require that for every loss of some benefit sustained by one school district there must be a corresponding immediate gain of another benefit or loss of a responsibility by that school district; consideration must also be given to intangible items as well as the future effect of an action. Edmore Pub. Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Pub. Sch. Educ., 326 N.W.2d 81, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 377</cite> (N.D. 1982).

      </p>
      <p>

   A petitioner for annexation has the burden of introducing evidence on as many factors as are necessary to establish a prima facie case for approval of his petition. A petitioner who does not introduce evidence on some factors runs the risk that the petition will not be approved. In re Annexation of Part of Donnybrook Pub. Sch. Dist., 365 N.W.2d 514, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 279</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   It is enough that the findings made by the state board of public school education are supported by a preponderance of the evidence and that they support its conclusions and decisions.

   Failure of the state board of public school education to prepare findings of fact required by this section required reversal of the judgment of the district court and remand with order directing the State Board to prepare findings.

   The legislature did not intend to require that the state board of public school education automatically grant a petition to annex out of a consortium, but that a consortium could annex to another district any time it secured approval of the board. AAFEDT v. North Dakota State Bd.of Pub. Sch. Educ. (In re Annexation of a Part of Utility Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 80), 540 N.W.2d 393, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>

   Former section 15-27.2-04(3) allowed a county committee or the state board of public school education to consider the amount of land in an annexation petition, because the catch-all category, “other relevant factors,” was sufficiently broad to encompass the amount of land involved. AAFEDT v. North Dakota State Bd.of Pub. Sch. Educ. (In re Annexation of a Part of Utility Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 80), 540 N.W.2d 393, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>

   To be effective, an annexation petition involving school districts situated in more than one county need only constitute an acceptable part of a comprehensive program adopted by one of the county committees, secure the approval of one of the county committees and the state board of public school education and, if an appeal is lodged pursuant to N.D.C.C ch. 28-32, withstand judicial review within the limited scope of review provided in N.D.C.C. §

         Specificity of Findings.

       <p>

   In reorganization hearings where the testimony is disputed, there is a need for more specific findings than might otherwise be warranted. Dunseith Pub. Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Pub. Sch. Educ., 401 N.W.2d 704, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a reorganization hearing before the state board of public school education where extensive, disputed testimony and documentary evidence was offered, the board’s findings did not refer to much of the evidence, failed altogether to discuss some factors to which testimony was directed, and were conclusory; therefore, the findings were not adequate to comply with the requirements of this section.

   Statute providing for public hearings on proposals for reorganization did not apply to annexation of public school districts. Edmore Pub. Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Pub. Sch. Educ., 326 N.W.2d 81, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 377</cite> (N.D. 1982).

       <p>

   Statutory provisions concerning annexation of land to school districts require, as a prerequisite to approval by either county committees or state committee, that annexation proposal constitutes an acceptable part of a comprehensive program for reorganization of school districts involved; where state committee made no such determination prior to approving annexation, its decision to approve annexation did not comply with requirements of statute on voluntary proposals for organization or alteration of school districts. McKenzie County Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Pub. Sch. Educ., 311 N.W.2d 167, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 386</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>

   It is not absolutely necessary that a comprehensive plan for reorganization be formally admitted into record before county committee or state board. Edmore Pub. Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Pub. Sch. Educ., 326 N.W.2d 81, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 377</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   An annexation involving land in school districts located in two counties need not be consistent with both counties’ comprehensive programs for the reorganization of school districts. In re Annexation of Part of Donnybrook Pub. Sch. Dist., 365 N.W.2d 514, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 279</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   One county committee’s comprehensive program for the reorganization of school districts cannot preclude approval of an annexation petition that complies with another county committee’s program when the school districts involved are situated in more than one county. In re Annexation of Part of Donnybrook Pub. Sch. Dist., 365 N.W.2d 514, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 279</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   To be effective, an annexation petition involving school districts situated in more than one county need only constitute an acceptable part of a comprehensive program adopted by one of the county committees, secure the approval of one of the county committees and the state board of public school education and, if an appeal is lodged pursuant to N.D.C.C ch. 28-32, withstand judicial review within the limited scope of review provided in N.D.C.C. §

   After the state board approved a proposed 188 mill levy in revised restructuring proposal in December 1992, the legislature chose to abridge restructured school districts’ taxing power by imposing a mill levy limit in cases where an election resulted in some, but not all, consortium participants voting to restructure and those districts voting in favor of restructuring proceeding to form a new district; thus, regardless of the situation existing in December 1992 when the state board approved the revised restructuring plan with a proposed mill levy of 188 mills, by the time the new school district came into existence, as of July 1, 1993, it was subject to the mill levy limit.

   A plain reading of former section 15-27.3-08 discloses that only an initial proposal must be put to a vote; once a vote has been taken, however, and some, but not all, districts vote in favor of a new district, the new interim district board can, without an election, adopt a new proposal and determine the tax levy.

   Subsection 3 of former section 15-27.3-08, as amended by H.B. 1003 in the 1993 legislative session, gave the interim board of merging districts authority to make a determination of tax levy different than the one in the original proposal, and the trial court erred in limiting the district’s maximum general fund mill levy to the levy allowed by the original proposal.

   School board’s directive to discontinue certain grades in one school and to transfer those students to a second school within the district did not amount to a “discontinuance” or “closing” of the transferor school within statute so that approval by election or petition was unnecessary.

If property from the dissolved district is attached to more than one school district, the percentage of the total credit to which each eligible real property owner is entitled must equal the percentage that the taxable valuation of the individual’s real property bears to the total taxable valuation of the dissolved district’s property at the time of the attachment order.

The treasurer shall issue the refund to the owner of the property as shown on the county’s assessment list at the time of payment. If there is a lien for unpaid taxes against the property, the treasurer shall first apply the property owner’s tax credit toward any outstanding balance.

        Collateral Attack.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   A second grade professional certificate was not subject to collateral attack. McDonald v. Nielson, 43 N.D. 346, 175 N.W. 361, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 48</cite> (N.D. 1919); Wendt v. Waller, 46 N.D. 268, 176 N.W. 930, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Contractual Relationship.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   A teacher employed by a common school district was not an officer of the district, but a mere employee. The relationship between the teacher and the district was purely contractual. Mootz v. Belyea, 60 N.D. 741, 236 N.W. 358, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1931); Seher v. Woodlawn Sch. Dist., 79 N.D. 818, 59 N.W.2d 805, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Discontinuance of School.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Former statute dealing with common schools required teacher’s contract to contain an express stipulation against compensation in case school was discontinued for specified causes. Sandry v. Brooklyn Sch. Dist., 47 N.D. 444, 182 N.W. 689, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Dismissal.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   A teacher could not be dismissed, for failure to perform her duty by an attempt to close the school under former statute. McWithy v. Heart River Sch. Dist., 75 N.D. 744, 32 N.W.2d 886 (1948), distinguished, Herman v. Medicine Lodge Sch. Dist., 71 N.W.2d 323 (N.D. 1955) and Linden Sch. Dist. v. Porter, 130 N.W.2d 76, 1964 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite> (N.D. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>

   Provision of former statute that the school board of a common school district “may dismiss a teacher at any time”, for certain causes, became a part of the teacher’s contract. Seher v. Woodlawn Sch. Dist., 79 N.D. 818, 59 N.W.2d 805, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>

   A school board’s dismissal of a teacher was the exercise of an executive function; but whether the dismissal constituted a breach of the teacher’s contract was for judicial determination. Seher v. Woodlawn Sch. Dist., 79 N.D. 818, 59 N.W.2d 805, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Judicial Review.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   When the superintendent of public instruction has determined the existence of the necessary qualifications to entitle one to a certificate, such determination cannot be reviewed by a judicial tribunal except for fraud. Wendt v. Waller, 46 N.D. 268, 176 N.W. 930, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1920).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Oral Contract.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Statutory requirement that contracts for the employment of a teacher be in writing was mandatory, and barred the teacher’s action for damages against a school district based on an oral contract of employment. Michaelsohn v. Norway Sch. Dist., 63 N.D. 683, 249 N.W. 776, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 224</cite> (N.D. 1933).

       <b>
        Professional Certificate.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   A professional certificate is a teacher’s certificate of the highest grade in this state. McDonald v. Nielson, 43 N.D. 346, 175 N.W. 361, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 48</cite> (N.D. 1919).

   It was incumbent on a teacher undertaking to question the authority of the attorney representing the school board, in an action based on the teacher’s nonrenewal, to show to the court by affidavit, facts sufficient to raise a reasonable presumption that the attorney was acting in the case without authority from the school board; not until then would the attorney be required to show his authority. Retzlaff v. Grand Forks Pub. Sch. Dist., 424 N.W.2d 637, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   Although plaintiff was in his first year of teaching in the school district, it was not his first year of teaching in the profession; therefore, he was not classified as a first-year teacher and would have been entitled to the nonrenewal hearing rights accorded to experienced teachers under subsection (5) of former section 15-47-38 (see now N.D.C.C. §

        Evidentiary Requirements.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   This section, relating to nonrenewal of first-year teachers, does not require the production and introduction of evidence such as would be required in a judicial hearing or an administrative hearing, or even in a nonrenewal hearing for teachers who have taught more than one year. Retzlaff v. Grand Forks Pub. Sch. Dist., 424 N.W.2d 637, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1988).

      <p>
       <b>
        Procedural Requirements.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   “Supervisory report” which indicated that a first-year teacher met with her supervisor and discussed the attainment of certain educational goals substantially complied with this section; substantial compliance with the procedural requirements for termination is sufficient if their purpose is fulfilled. Retzlaff v. Grand Forks Pub. Sch. Dist., 424 N.W.2d 637, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>

   Where alleged secret meetings of school board members occurred seven weeks after the nonrenewal vote had been taken at a regular, open meeting, neither the public nor the teacher whose contract was not renewed was prejudiced, particularly in light of the fact that had the teacher been entitled to a hearing, either the board or the teacher could have elected to have the hearing closed.

   Disqualification of the employee, a teacher, from receiving unemployment benefits was appropriate because there was evidence that the employee disregarded the employer’s interest and deliberately violated the standards of behavior that the employer, a school district, had a right to expect from her.

   In this case, the school district’s reasons for non-renewal could constitute disqualifying misconduct for purposes of unemployment compensation benefits.

   Where high school mathematics teacher with favorable record and seven years’ experience in the system was denied contract renewal for the stated reason that he violated a system rule by leaving his class unattended for twenty minutes on one occasion while he went home to clear his sidewalk of an overnight accumulation of snow, and it appeared that one or two members of the board who voted not to renew acted on the recommendation of the school administration rather than deciding upon the merits of the case, the alleged cause was insufficient to justify dismissal, indicated that the board did not seriously consider the impact of nonrenewal on the teacher’s reputation and acted unduly harshly, and trial court’s finding of abuse of discretion was warranted. Baker v. Minot Pub. Sch. Dist., 253 N.W.2d 444, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 272</cite> (N.D. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>

   The school board, after having given the teacher written notice of its reasons for the contemplated nonrenewal of the teacher’s contract, may not, at the hearing with the teacher, articulate new or additional reasons for its action nor may the board, in determining to not renew a teacher’s contract, rely upon reasons not contained in the notice to the teacher and explained, at the hearing. Dobervich v. Central Cass Pub. Sch. Dist., 302 N.W.2d 745, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>

   Where reasons given for nonrenewal of teacher’s contract consisted of poor motivation of the low academic achiever, substandard student project work, and student attitude showing reluctance rather than cooperation in the learning process, such reasons were not frivolous or arbitrary and were sufficient to justify the nonrenewal. Dobervich v. Central Cass Pub. Sch. Dist., 302 N.W.2d 745, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>

   This section does not require school board to articulate its reasons for selecting for nonrenewal one teacher over another when the stated reason for nonrenewal is reduction in the teaching staff due to school system’s financial difficulty. Reed v. Edgeley Pub. Sch. Dist., 313 N.W.2d 775, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 351</cite> (N.D. 1981).

   Teachers’ contracts can be nonrenewed for a lack of qualifications. Feldhusen v. Beach Pub. Sch. Dist., 423 N.W.2d 155, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>

   Policy requiring teachers to acquire a certain number of college credits in a five-year period became part of a professional-negotiations agreement between the school board and the teachers; therefore, where teacher failed to fulfill these requirements nonrenewal under this section was justified. Feldhusen v. Beach Pub. Sch. Dist., 423 N.W.2d 155, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>

   Failure of a Specific Learning Disabilities (SLD) teacher to acquire the required SLD credential was a proper ground for nonrenewal. Bradley v. Beach Pub. Sch. Dist., 427 N.W.2d 352, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>

   The reasons for nonrenewal of contract listed in the nonrenewal notice must be drawn from findings arising from the written evaluation of the teacher. Hoffner v. Bismarck Pub. Sch. Dist., 1999 ND 3, 589 N.W.2d 195, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Reduction in Force Policy.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   A reduction in force policy which contemplates a consideration of the qualifications of the various teachers in the system, imposes an additional contractual obligation upon the school district in reaching its decision not to renew a particular teacher; since it increases the minimal protection provided to the teachers, reduction in force policy is not inconsistent with the intent of this section to benefit teachers and is to be given the same effect as other contractual provisions. Law v. Mandan Pub. Sch. Dist., 411 N.W.2d 375, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 384</cite> (N.D. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>

   Reduction in force policy is part of the contract between a district and its teachers, and trial court should have determined whether a district met its contractual obligations under that policy before granting summary judgment against teacher claiming wrongful nonrenewal and a violation of the policy. Borr v. McKenzie County Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 541 N.W.2d 681, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 1995).

      </p>
      <p>

   The one-seventh reduction in a teacher’s base teaching salary accompanying the loss of his position as athletic director was a “severe reduction in salary for curricular activities,” requiring that the nonrenewal procedures of former section 15-47-27 and 15-47-38 (now N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.15.1.html#t15c15.1-15s15.1-15-04" target="_blank">15.1-15-04</a></cite> and N.D.C.C. §

      </p>
      <p>

   Counselor’s four percent salary reduction was a “severe reduction” which required the Board to comply with the nonrenewal provisions of this section. While the seven percent cut in state funding faced by the Board may have been a reasonable and primary factor for reducing the counselor’s contract, that consideration required substantiation at a nonrenewal hearing.

   The duration of a nonrenewal hearing, lasting almost twelve hours with recesses and a supper break, did not offend this section’s requirement that “all actions of the board be taken with consideration and dignity, giving maximum consideration to basic fairness and decency” where the teacher involved, upon advice of counsel, agreed to continue the hearing and did not request a continuance. Rolland v. Grand Forks Pub. Sch. Dist., 279 N.W.2d 889, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 1979).

   The inclusion of a teacher’s spouse and attorney in the number of representatives that a teacher may have present at a nonrenewal hearing held in executive session does not offend the requirement of this section that “all actions of the board be taken with consideration and dignity, giving maximum consideration to basic fairness and decency”.

       <p>

   Where school board notified three teachers of contemplated nonrenewal of their contracts, this section’s requirement of fairness and decency did not require school board to hold a joint meeting with the three teachers to explain the criteria which was going to be used in board’s decision to nonrenew; did not require that each teacher be informed of what was said or discussed at other teachers’ nonrenewal hearings; and was not violated where board decided to retain two of the teachers before the third teacher’s hearing but had an option to reopen the hearings on the two teachers when the third teacher’s hearing was held.

   The requirement that the board shall confirm its reasons for the contemplated nonrenewal of the contract does not place an evidentiary burden of proof upon the board to sustain the charges, but merely requires the board to vote to nonrenew the contract for reasons stated in the notice of contemplated nonrenewal; thus, confirming the action by which it decided to send the notice of contemplated nonrenewal of the contract.

   Teacher was not denied his statutory rights by board’s reliance upon the teacher’s evaluations from prior years in deciding not to renew teacher’s contract where, although no notice was given the teacher that such evaluations would be relied upon, the teacher and some board members discussed the evaluations at the hearing.

       <p>

   When nonrenewal action is taken on grounds relating to the ability, competence or qualifications of a teacher, written evaluations are essential; however, where the contemplated nonrenewal did not involve a question of ability, but was related solely to other necessities of the school district such as lack of enrollment, elimination of position and lack of funds, competency as a teacher was not in issue, and failure to reduce the second evaluation to writing by a certain date was harmless error.

   Rights of teachers facing nonrenewal of their contracts to have hearing in executive session of school board was not infringed by presence of superintendent at hearings. Dathe v. Wildrose Sch. Dist., 217 N.W.2d 781, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 233</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>

   Teacher who was given hearing before school board, furnished with reasons relating to teaching competence and functions for nonrenewal of contract, and allowed a minimal discussion of reasons was afforded rights provided by this section, despite contention that teacher was entitled to more than a formal compliance with procedures and fact that discussion came down to an acceptance of superintendent’s judgment.

   At hearing to dismiss teacher due to his failure to conform to school board’s policy on disciplining students, school board was not limited to considering the latest incident, the slapping of a student in the face, but could consider past events of a similar nature to establish a pattern of teacher’s conduct and to show that teacher was put on notice of his expected conduct in disciplining students. Lithun v. Grand Forks Pub. Sch. Dist., 307 N.W.2d 545, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 321</cite> (N.D. 1981).

   Where a teacher claimed he did not receive a fair discharge hearing, even if a school board member’s ex parte communication with a student’s parent violated N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-37" target="_blank">28-32-37</a></cite> and did not fall within “general interest” communication contemplated under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-37" target="_blank">28-32-37</a></cite>(9), the teacher did not show prejudice from the violation, as the outcome of his hearing would not have been different had the violation not occurred.

   Kilber v. Grand Forks Pub. Sch. Dist., 2012 ND 157, 820 N.W.2d 96, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 2012).

   As a discharged teacher failed to establish that he suffered harm or was prejudiced as a result of the procedural errors that occurred during the discharge hearing and because, under either N.D.C.C. ch. 28-32 or N.D.C.C. ch. 28-34, his discharge was supported by the record, he was not denied a fair hearing.

   It was no abuse of discretion to require a school district to offer a teacher's association a contract for one year, under the district's authority to unilaterally issue a last-offer contract on reaching an impasse, because limiting a this authority to a single school year then under negotiation was consistent with the purpose of letting a school district bring good-faith negotiations for an ensuing school year to an end to permit schools to operate.

   In a teacher contract dispute, the “teacher shall” language in a grievance policy did not prohibit a teacher association from utilizing the grievance procedures set forth in an agreement when the grievance effected the terms and conditions of a majority of the teachers and concerned the interpretation of the agreement; a restrictive reading would have effectively ignored the purpose for the agreement as set forth by the parties.

   Education association’s writ of mandamus was denied where it did not demonstrate a clear legal right to remove additional contract language regarding an identified teacher need, N.D.C.C. ch. 15-38.1, and there was no bad faith in the negotiations by the school district, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.15.1.html#t15c15.1-16s15.1-16-13" target="_blank">15.1-16-13</a></cite>; the school district’s limited ability to contract separately was not contrary to N.D.C.C. ch. 15.1-16.

   In a teacher contract dispute, the “teacher shall” language in a grievance policy did not prohibit a teacher association from utilizing the grievance procedures set forth in an agreement when the grievance effected the terms and conditions of a majority of the teachers and concerned the interpretation of the agreement; a restrictive reading would have effectively ignored the purpose for the agreement as set forth by the parties. Moreover, nothing in the agreement prohibited the association from bringing a legal action after a grievance had been denied or negotiations had failed. Williston Educ. Ass'n v. Williston Pub. Sch.

   Where school board issued teaching contracts to individual teachers after negotiations with their bargaining representative had deadlocked and an education factfinding committee had issued its report, but before the parties had agreed they were at an impasse, it did not violate its duty to bargain in good faith since it appeared that its actions were taken pursuant to an erroneous belief that report of the factfinder terminated the negotiation process.

   It was no abuse of discretion to require a school district to offer a teacher's association a contract for one year, under the district's authority to unilaterally issue a last-offer contract on reaching an impasse, because limiting a this authority to a single school year then under negotiation was consistent with the purpose of letting a school district bring good-faith negotiations for an ensuing school year to an end to permit schools to operate.

   Where doctor certificates recommended that women not teach for six weeks following delivery of their babies, but contained no specific statement that the women were unable to perform their duties as teachers for the six-week period, the women were not entitled to six weeks of sick leave under the school district’s sick leave policy, but only for the three weeks during which they were unable to work.

   Parents who sent their children to a nonapproved fundamental Baptist church school were in violation of the compulsory school attendance law, and application of that law to such parents was not unconstitutional on basis of claim by parents that requiring children to be sent to an approved school was in violation of their rights under the Free Exercise of Religion Clause of the first amendment of the United States Constitution where compulsory school attendance at an approved school would not pose a very real threat of undermining the Bible Baptist Church members’, including the parents’, existing community and religious practices, and any burden imposed on the parents’ free exercise of religion was minimal and far outweighed by the state’s compelling interest in providing education for its people. State v. Shaver, 294 N.W.2d 883, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>

   Parents violated the compulsory school attendance law where they sent their children to a nonapproved church school because of claim that it would violate their religious beliefs to send their children to teachers who submitted themselves to the state teacher certification process and to a school which submitted itself to the approval process; the compulsory school attendance law, as applied to the parents, did not unduly impinge upon parent’s constitutional right to the free exercise of religion since the state constitutional mandate for the provision of schools and education established a compelling interest by the state in the education of its people, with teacher certification being an acceptable method of satisfying part of that constitutional mandate, and the resulting strain or imposition on the parent’s religious beliefs by the compulsory school attendance law was outbalanced by the state’s compelling interest in the education of its people. State v. Rivinius, 328 N.W.2d 220, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 403</cite> (N.D. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1070, 103 S. Ct. 1525, 75 L. Ed. 2d 948, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 3796 (U.S. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>

   The state has a compelling interest in ensuring that public or nonpublic education is conducted by persons who are knowledgeable and able to impart that knowledge in a manner conducive to a child’s education; therefore, the requirement that a child taught outside the public school system must be taught by a person certified to teach in this state did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the parents’ right to free exercise of religion. State v. Melin, 428 N.W.2d 227, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 942, 109 S. Ct. 367, 102 L. Ed. 2d 357, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5035 (U.S. 1988).

   Intentional noncompliance with the compulsory attendance law is a violation by the parent, not the child. In Interest of C.S., 382 N.W.2d 381, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 272</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   Prior to the 1971 amendment to N.D.C.C. §

   27-20-02, “unruly child” was defined as “a child who while subject to compulsory school attendance is habitually and without justification truant from school”. The 1971 amendment deleted the phrase, “while subject to compulsory school attendance”, the sponsor of the bill testifying that the compulsory attendance law applied only to the parent, and not the child. Therefore, it should not be necessary to show a violation of the compulsory attendance law as a prerequisite to finding that a child is habitually truant without justification and, consequently, “unruly”.

   A school census taken four months prior to the beginning of the alleged period of violation of this section, which did not reflect residency status during the time in question and was improperly admitted into evidence, and a school superintendent’s testimony referring to a telephone conversation on an unspecified date, failed to support the state’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the element of residency within the school district.

       <p>

   In a criminal prosecution of parents for violation of the compulsory school attendance law, a school district census exhibit was not furnished to defense counsel until during the trial; therefore, the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the exhibit, since admitting the exhibit violated Rule 803(8), N.D.

   This section requires the local school board to monitor whether or not a school-age child is attending a school that has been approved by the county superintendent of schools and superintendent of public instruction, and attendance at an approved private or parochial school automatically satisfies the compulsory attendance law; therefore, the local school board’s act is a ministerial function rather than a discretionary, decision-making function, and this section does not violate the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.

       <p>

   The state has an interest in the teacher certification feature of the compulsory school attendance laws which is of sufficient magnitude to override the burden imposed upon the religious interests claimed by parents who refused to send their children to school and instead sought, without teacher certification, to educate them in their homes. State v. Patzer, 382 N.W.2d 631, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 825, 107 S. Ct. 99, 93 L. Ed. 2d 50, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 3484 (U.S. 1986).

   Balancing the defendants’ religious beliefs and the nature of the burden imposed upon those beliefs by the teacher certification requirement against the state’s interest in certification as a means of ensuring that its children are educated by capable persons, the supreme court of North Dakota finds the balance in this case tips in favor of the state. State v. Patzer, 382 N.W.2d 631, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 825, 107 S. Ct. 99, 93 L. Ed. 2d 50, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 3484 (U.S. 1986).

   Parents do not have the right, because of their religious beliefs, to educate their children at home without complying with a law requiring certification of all persons who give instruction to children within the state. State v. Patzer, 382 N.W.2d 631, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 825, 107 S. Ct. 99, 93 L. Ed. 2d 50, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 3484 (U.S. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   Teacher certification appears to be among the least personally intrusive methods now available to satisfy the state’s prime interest in seeing that its children are taught by capable persons. State v. Patzer, 382 N.W.2d 631, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 825, 107 S. Ct. 99, 93 L. Ed. 2d 50, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 3484 (U.S. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   The teacher certification requirement for instructors in public, non-public, or home schools is a reasonably narrow one and is amply justified. State v. Patzer, 382 N.W.2d 631, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 825, 107 S. Ct. 99, 93 L. Ed. 2d 50, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 3484 (U.S. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   Although the parents’ religious beliefs were sincere and teacher certification had an adverse effect on the practice of their religion, the State had a compelling interest in the education of children, and teacher certification is the least restrictive alternative to satisfy the State’s compelling interest in education; therefore, the requirement for teacher certification does not violate the free exercise clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.State v. Anderson, 427 N.W.2d 316, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 965, 109 S. Ct. 491, 102 L. Ed. 2d 528, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5256 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   The state has a compelling interest in ensuring that public or nonpublic education is conducted by persons who are knowledgeable and able to impart that knowledge in a manner conducive to a child’s education; therefore, the requirement that a child taught outside the public school system must be taught by a person certified to teach in this state did not unconstitutionally infringe upon the parents’ right to free exercise of religion. State v. Melin, 428 N.W.2d 227, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 942, 109 S. Ct. 367, 102 L. Ed. 2d 357, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5035 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   State’s appeal from a judgment of “not guilty,” entered upon a dismissal of a complaint charging the defendants with violating the compulsory school-attendance law, did not violate the defendants’ double jeopardy rights, because the trial court determination that the teacher certification requirement was an unconstitutional infringement of the defendants’ right to free exercise of religion was not a resolution of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged and was not an acquittal. State v. Melin, 428 N.W.2d 227, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 942, 109 S. Ct. 367, 102 L. Ed. 2d 357, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 5035 (U.S. 1988).

      Each school district and public school shall ensure instruction of its curriculum is factual, objective, and aligned to the kindergarten through grade twelve state content standards. A school district or public school may not include instruction relating to critical race theory in any portion of the district’s required curriculum under sections 15.1-21-01 or 15.1-21-02, or any other curriculum offered by the district or school. For purposes of this section, “critical race theory” means the theory that racism is not merely the product of learned individual bias or prejudice, but that racism is systemically embedded in American society and the American legal system to facilitate racial inequality. The superintendent of public instruction may adopt rules to govern this section.

      A parent who does not meet the qualifications provided in section 15.1-23-03 may supervise home education but must be monitored in accordance with section 15.1-23-07 for the first two years. If a child receiving home education obtains a basic composite standardized achievement test score below the fiftieth percentile nationally, the parent must be monitored for at least one additional school year and until the child receives a test score at or above the fiftieth percentile. If testing is not required by section 15.1-23-07 during the first two years of monitoring, the period of monitoring may not be extended, except upon the mutual consent of the parent and the monitor. If a parent completes the monitoring requirements of this section for one child, the parent may not be monitored with respect to other children for whom the parent supervises home education.

      <p>

   Former section was intended to apply only in those cases where the receiving district already had facilities for seating and instruction which, in the judgment of its board, warranted the admission of nonresident pupils. Todd v. Board of Educ., 54 N.D. 235, 209 N.W. 369, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1926).

        Tuition.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Where a tuition charge is imposed upon nonresident pupils admitted to a high school, such charge must be alike to all, and the board may not arbitrarily admit certain pupils and exclude others. Todd v. Board of Educ., 54 N.D. 235, 209 N.W. 369, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>

   A school district cannot be compelled to pay the tuition of pupils attending any high school other than a standardized high school; a high school in a special school district not supervised by the department of public instruction nor receiving state aid was not a “standardized high school” within statute relating to admission of nonresident pupils. State ex rel. Mannes v. Alquist, 59 N.D. 762, 231 N.W. 952, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 1930).

       <p>
        A state’s decision to allow local school boards the option of charging patrons a user fee for bus service is constitutionally permissible. Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2878 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section discriminates against no suspect class and interferes with no fundamental right. The statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2878 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section is purely economic legislation which involves neither a suspect classification nor a fundamental or important substantive right which would require the strict scrutiny or intermediate standard of review; in equal protection challenges to legislation involving student transportation the traditional rational basis standard of review has been employed; thus, this section must be upheld unless it is patently arbitrary and fails to bear a rational relationship to any legitimate government purpose. Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 402 N.W.2d 897, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 275</cite> (N.D. 1987), aff'd, 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2878 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Encouraging local school districts to provide school bus service is a legitimate state purpose and such encouragement would be undermined by a rule requiring that general revenues be used to subsidize an optional service that would benefit a minority of the district’s families. Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2878 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   Schoolbus charges authorized by this section are rationally related to the legitimate governmental objective of allocating limited resources, and this section does not discriminate on the basis of wealth so as to violate federal or state equal protection rights. Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 402 N.W.2d 897, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 275</cite> (N.D. 1987), aff'd, 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2878 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section does not violate the federal or state equal protection rights of persons residing in nonreorganized districts. Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 402 N.W.2d 897, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 275</cite> (N.D. 1987), aff'd, 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2878 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   Section 15-34.2-06.1 (now N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.15.1.html#t15c15.1-30s15.1-30-05" target="_blank">15.1-30-05</a></cite>), which authorizes charges for schoolbus service, does not violate N.D. Const., art. VIII, §

   2, Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 402 N.W.2d 897, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 275</cite> (N.D. 1987), aff'd, 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2878 (U.S. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that this section was both arbitrary and irrational. Kadrmas v. Dickinson Pub. Sch., 487 U.S. 450, 108 S. Ct. 2481, 101 L. Ed. 2d 399, 1988 U.S. LEXIS 2878 (U.S. 1988).

       <p>
        In nonreorganized districts local school boards may impose a bus service user fee on their own authority, while the direct approval of the voters would be required in reorganized districts. The difference between these districts, however, simply reflects voluntary agreements made during the history of North Dakota’s reorganization process, and could scarcely be thought to make the state’s laws arbitrary or irrational.
