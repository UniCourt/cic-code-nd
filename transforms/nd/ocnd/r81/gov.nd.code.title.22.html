        When general partners personally guaranty a general partnership mortgage debt, the anti-deficiency statutes are applicable, and the procedures for deficiency judgments outlined in First State Bank v. Ihringer, 217 N.W.2d 857 (1974), must be satisfied. However, because of contractual expectations, this decision will be applied prospectively. First Interstate Bank v. Larson, 475 N.W.2d 538 (N.D. 1991), overruling Mandan Sec. Bank v. Heinsohn, 320 N.W.2d 494 (N.D. 1982), decided prior to the amendment to N.D.C.C. §§ 22-01-12 and 45-06-07, by Session Laws 1993, ch. 246.

   A guaranty of payment of a note at maturity, or at any time thereafter, or any renewal thereof, is not a “continuing guaranty” within the statute. Baird v. Foss Inv. Co., 58 N.D. 345, 226 N.W. 523, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1929).

   Because to answer for the default of a municipality on a bond issued pursuant to the Municipal Industrial Development Act (N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-57s40-57-01" target="_blank">40-57-01</a></cite> et seq.) constituted obligations separate and distinct from the bond itself, the bond holder could enforce those guaranties by suing on them, without regard to the anti-deficiency statutes, which were not applicable to those guaranties.

        General partners who personally guaranty a general partnership’s mortgage debt have not changed the nature of their obligation on the debt. The partners are parties personally liable for the partnership’s debt and, pursuant to former subdivision (1) of this section (now subdivision (2)), the partners have not personally guarantied the debt of another. First Interstate Bank v. Larson, 475 N.W.2d 538 (N.D. 1991), decided prior to the amendment to N.D.C.C. §§ 22-01-12 and 45-06-07, by Session Laws 1993, ch. 246.

   District court properly awarded a monetary judgment to a factoring servicer in its action for breach of contract and to collect on a personal guaranty because the testimony of a subcontractor’s president established that the subcontractor consented to the sub-subcontractors’ assignments to the servicer, the president signed the guaranty in his personal capacity, even though he included his representative capacity for the corporation, and, while consideration did not need to be expressed in a guaranty, the subcontractor was conferred a benefit by being able to continue operations and the president was similarly conferred that benefit as the corporation’s president and owner.

   Under a guaranty of payment, the guarantor undertakes unconditionally that the debtor will pay, and the creditor may, upon default, proceed directly against him without taking any step to collect from the principal debtor; under a guaranty of collection, the undertaking is that, if the demand cannot be collected by legal proceedings, the guarantor will pay, and legal proceedings against the principal debtor and a failure to collect from him by those means are conditions precedent to the liability of the guarantor.

   A conditional promise to pay the indebtedness of a third person is not sufficient to bind the promisor unless in writing. McMillan v. Aitchison, 3 N.D. 183, 54 N.W. 1030, 1893 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 1893).

   Because trial court’s finding of no oral guaranty was not erroneous, the “leading object” rule was inapplicable. The “leading object” rule is not a test for gauging whether, under the circumstances, an oral guaranty has been given; rather, the rule is used for determining whether an oral guaranty is excepted from the statute of frauds. Dakota Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Funfar, 443 N.W.2d 289, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 1989).

   When an agent pays the obligation of his principal, he does not become a surety thereby for other debts of his principal. McArthur v. Dryden, 6 N.D. 438, 71 N.W. 125, 1897 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1897).

   An oral agreement with a person not a party to an instrument to discharge overdue promissory note by accepting property in lieu of money is unenforceable until full performance by delivery and acceptance of the property. First Nat'l Bank v. Burdick, 51 N.D. 508, 200 N.W. 44, 1923 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 1923).

   Where the promise is to subserve some interest or purpose of the promisor, notwithstanding the effect is to pay or discharge the debt of another, the promise is an original obligation and not a promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another. Glock v. Hillestad, 85 N.W.2d 568, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1957).

   Oral guarantee of general contractor, guaranteeing payment for boiler supplied by supplier to subcontractor, served a purpose of the promisor, i.e., discharge of it’s contractual obligation to furnish a boiler to fulfill its contractual obligations, and was enforceable as an “original obligation.” Baker Mfg. Co. Wholesale Div. v. Kramer Sheet Metal, 371 N.W.2d 149, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 359</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   Where it appears that a party was told by another that he would see that goods delivered to a third person, and charged to such person, would be paid for, there is established a promise to pay for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another within the statute of frauds. Gidley v. Glass, 41 N.D. 542, 171 N.W. 93, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 1919).

   Although the facts did not bring the case within the exceptions to the statute of frauds set out in this section, defendant was not allowed to invoke the statute of frauds as a defense to an action on defendant’s oral guarantee to repay loans made by plaintiff to the corporation of which defendant was an incorporator and a stockholder where defendant induced plaintiff to make the loan and gave several assurances that it would be repaid, defendant was in a position of trust with plaintiff when she was in an emotionally weakened state, defendant induced plaintiff to make the loan under false pretenses that he was unable financially to make the loan himself, defendant and the corporation repeatedly refused to comply with plaintiff’s request that papers be drawn up concerning the terms of the loan, and defendant received a direct personal benefit from the loan in the form of a reimbursement he received from the corporation on a loan that he had made, since to allow the defendant to invoke the statute of frauds under such facts would promote an injustice.

       Guaranty of solvency — Failure to take proceedings to collect — Removal of principal from state.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A guaranty to the effect that an obligation is good or is collectible imports that the debtor is solvent and that the demand is collectible by the usual legal proceedings if the same are taken with reasonable diligence. Such a guaranty is not discharged by any omission to take proceedings upon the principal debt or upon any collateral security for its payment if no part of the debt could have been collected thereby. The removal of the principal from the state, leaving no property therein from which the obligation might be satisfied, is equivalent to the insolvency of the principal in its effect upon the rights and obligations of the guarantor.

       Limitations upon obligation of guarantor.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The obligation of a guarantor must be neither larger in amount, nor in other respects more burdensome, than that of the principal. A stockholder or partner of any entity, including a limited liability company, business corporation, professional corporation, and partnership, may enter into a separate contract of guaranty for the real estate mortgage debt of the entity. If in its terms the obligation exceeds that of the principal, the obligation is reducible in proportion to the principal obligation.

   By 1993 legislation, the Legislature removed anti-deficiency protection from a group that the Supreme Court had previously held was protected. The Legislature has clearly signaled an intent not to protect guarantors with the anti-deficiency statutes. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Anseth, 503 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   The district court erred in dismissing a bondholder’s action on guaranties and ordering compliance with the anti-deficiency statutes. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Anseth, 503 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        When general partners personally guaranty a general partnership mortgage debt, the anti-deficiency statutes are applicable, and the procedures for deficiency judgments outlined in First State Bank v. Ihringer, 217 N.W.2d 857 (1974), must be satisfied. However, because of contractual expectations, this decision will be applied prospectively. First Interstate Bank v. Larson, 475 N.W.2d 538 (N.D. 1991), overruling Mandan Sec. Bank v. Heinsohn, 320 N.W.2d 494 (N.D. 1982), decided prior to the amendment to this section by Session Laws 1993, ch. 246.

        General partners who personally guaranty a general partnership’s mortgage debt have not changed the nature of their obligation on the debt. The partners are parties personally liable for the partnership’s debt and, pursuant to former subdivision (1) (now subdivision (2)) of section 22-01-01, the partners have not personally guarantied the debt of another. First Interstate Bank v. Larson, 475 N.W.2d 538 (N.D. 1991), decided prior to the amendment to N.D.C.C. §§ 22-01-12 and 45-06-07, by Session Laws 1993, ch. 246.

     <p>
      A continuing guaranty may be revoked at any time by the guarantor in respect to future transactions unless there is a continuing consideration as to such transactions which the guarantor does not renounce. If the contract of guaranty signed by the guarantor so states, the revocation must be in writing and delivered to the guarantee. If the contract does not so state, an oral attempt to revoke is not effective if at the time of the oral communication the guarantee requests delivery of a written revocation and confirms the request in writing.

   Mere fact that creditor takes new notes as collateral security for debt, which mature after the time the debt for which surety is liable comes due, will not discharge surety if there is an express condition that their acceptance should not operate to extend the time of payment. Foster County State Bank v. Hester, 18 N.D. 135, 119 N.W. 1044, 1909 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 1909).

   Prior to the enactment of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the extension of the time of payment of a guaranteed note for valuable consideration, and without the consent of the guarantor, released the guarantor from liability. Northern State Bank v. Bellamy, 19 N.D. 509, 125 N.W. 888, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1910).

   An agreement extending the time within which payment of the principal obligation must be made, if without the assent of the guarantor thereof, and if binding on the creditor so as to prohibit him from enforcing the obligation for the extended period, exonerates the guarantor from liability, except so far as may be indemnified by the principal.

   District court properly found that the seller's CEO had authority to execute a stock purchase agreement on behalf of his wife and the other selling shareholders because the statute at issue authorized the action, the shareholders and board of directors authorized the CEO, individually and as their agent, to execute the stock purchase agreement, and the stock purchase agreement included two paragraphs relating to the judgment creditor's litigation and indemnification, and nothing statutorily relating to indemnity required a contract for indemnity to be in writing.

       Rules applied in interpretation of a contract of indemnity.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In the interpretation of a contract of indemnity, unless a contrary intention appears, the following rules are to be applied:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t22c22-02s22-02-07ol11">
       Upon an indemnity against liability, expressly or in other equivalent terms, the person indemnified is entitled to recover upon becoming liable.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c22-02s22-02-07ol12">
       Upon an indemnity against claims, demands, damages, or costs, expressly or in other equivalent terms, the person indemnified is not entitled to recover without payment thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c22-02s22-02-07ol13">
       An indemnity against claims, demands, or liability, expressly or in other equivalent terms, embraces the costs of defense against such claims, demands, or liability incurred in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable discretion.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c22-02s22-02-07ol14">
       The person indemnifying is bound, on the request of the person indemnified, to defend actions or proceedings brought against the latter in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity, but the person indemnified has the right to conduct such defense if that person chooses to do so.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c22-02s22-02-07ol15">
       If, after request, the person indemnifying neglects to defend the person indemnified, a recovery against the latter, suffered by the latter in good faith, is conclusive in the latter’s favor against the former.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c22-02s22-02-07ol16">
       If the person indemnifying, whether that person is a principal or a surety in the agreement, has not had reasonable notice of action or proceedings against the person indemnified or is not allowed to control its defense, judgment against the latter is only presumptive evidence against the former.
      </li>
      <li id="t22c22-02s22-02-07ol17">
       A stipulation that a judgment against the person indemnified shall be conclusive upon the person indemnifying is inapplicable if the person indemnifying had a good defense upon the merits which, by want of ordinary care, the person indemnifying failed to establish in the action.

   One signing a bond for a depository of public funds is a surety for the benefit of the debtor, and cannot be held beyond the expressed terms of his contract which will be interpreted as other contracts are interpreted. Mountrail County v. Farmers' State Bank, 53 N.D. 789, 208 N.W. 380, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1926).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Although a conveyance made subject to an existing and specified incumbrance does not alone obligate the grantee to pay the mortgage debt, a grantee who assumes a mortgage debt becomes primarily liable for the debt. Under these circumstances, the assuming grantee, if the original mortgagee assents to the arrangement, becomes the principal, the grantor becomes a surety and the grantee, upon default, is subject to foreclosure of the property. First Interstate Bank, N.A. v. Rebarchek, 511 N.W.2d 235, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 1994).

   Where, under the terms of a warranty deed, a transferee assumed and agreed to pay a mortgage, and received and made use of the property, the transferee became the principal obligor and the transferor a surety, the party secondarily liable.

        Company that issued a bond which guaranteed a subcontractor’s performance on a road construction project on an Indian reservation was not liable under the bond for work a construction company performed on the project before an Indian tribe issued a contract to the subcontractor and the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a notice to proceed. However, the district court’s judgment awarding the construction company $ 84,049.32 for work it performed after the tribe issued a contract to the subcontractor was not clearly erroneous because the subcontractor knew about additional charges the construction company demanded to perform the work and approved those charges.

       <p>

   A gratuitous surety is a favorite of the law, and the contract must be strictly construed so as to impose on the surety only the burdens clearly within its terms, and it cannot be extended by implication, presumption, or construction. Watkins Prods. v. Anhorn, 193 N.W.2d 228, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>

   Gratuitous surety’s obligation was limited to amount on agreement when signed and not amount for which principal was obligated to creditor, even though agreement contained an open-ended provision, because agreement was otherwise misleading and ambiguous and construed against the creditor-maker. Watkins Prods. v. Anhorn, 193 N.W.2d 228, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1971).

   Where blanks in a surety bond are filled without authority by a creditor so as to contain the amount of the existing indebtedness owing by the principal to the creditor, there is a material alteration avoiding the instrument. J. R. Watkins Co. v. Keeney, 52 N.D. 280, 201 N.W. 833, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1924).

         Matters Outside Contract of Suretyship.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   The favor with which the law regards sureties cannot affect the determination of collateral questions which, though indirectly touching the interests of the sureties, do not arise out of the contract of suretyship itself. State Bank v. Nester, 385 N.W.2d 95, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        <b>
         Notice of Default.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Where the bond requires notice of any default in any of its terms and conditions, notice must be given to the sureties within the specified time, or the sureties are released. Mountrail County v. Farmers' State Bank, 53 N.D. 789, 208 N.W. 380, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where the surety received timely notice of default and the amount claimed was fixed, the right of the surety was not prejudiced by a failure of creditor to file a second claim within the time provided in the bond, and the creditor could recover from the surety on the second claim. Ireland's Lumber Yard v. Progressive Contractors, 122 N.W.2d 554, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where claimant fails to give timely notice of default to any of persons named in bond and brings suit on bond against sureties, sureties are exonerated only to extent to which they were prejudiced by the omission; materialman’s failure to give notice of claim to anyone other than principal did not bar action against sureties where latter were not prejudiced thereby. Robertson Lumber Co. v. Progressive Contractors, 160 N.W.2d 61, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 65</cite> (N.D. 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 714, 89 S. Ct. 1451, 22 L.

   If the holder of the note, at time of signing thereof by the surety, takes collateral security from the principal debtor, he holds such collateral in trust, and if surety pays obligation, he is entitled to reimburse himself by having such collateral applied in reduction of amount of money which surety has paid the holder. Scandinavian Am. Bank v. Westby, 41 N.D. 276, 172 N.W. 665, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 1918).

         Ratable Distribution Among Sureties.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Payee bank’s failure to distribute the proceeds from a collateral sale ratably among the three notes was prejudicial to the remedies and rights surety of two notes had in the collateral. The extent of this prejudice is not the entire amount due on the one note at issue, but rather the difference between surety’s full liability on that note and his liability which remains after a ratable distribution of the proceeds has reduced the amount surety owes on the note. State Bank v. Nester, 385 N.W.2d 95, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   A renunciation of rights against a principal debtor normally discharges a surety; however, a renunciation of rights against or discharge of a surety does not discharge the principal debtor. First Interstate Bank, N.A. v. Rebarchek, 511 N.W.2d 235, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 1994).

   Where the form of obligation is such that the sureties may be sued in a separate action, the creditor may proceed against them in the first instance without being held to have exonerated the sureties. Bottineau County Bank v. Stafford, 49 N.D. 942, 194 N.W. 393, 1923 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1923).

      A surety may require the surety’s creditor to proceed against the principal or to pursue any other remedy in the creditor’s power which the surety cannot pursue and which would lighten the surety’s burden.

   Contract executed by guarantors guarantying prompt payment, at maturity, of all notes of debtor corporation was an absolute, unconditional, continuing guaranty of payment as distinguished, from a guaranty of collection and from a surety contract, and thus guarantors were not exonerated by creditor’s refusal to proceed against principal debtor; even if guarantors were considered as sureties, this section would not have exonerated them where they had the same privilege and opportunity to sue debtor as creditor had.

   In the absence of notice under this section, a creditor is not required to proceed originally against the principal debtor, and where he holds a real estate mortgage securing indebtedness, and where he obtains judgment against the debtor, he is not required to exhaust remedies on the mortgage or judgment before proceeding against the surety at the peril of exonerating the surety under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t22c22-03s22-03-06" target="_self">22-03-06</a></cite>.

   To avail itself of the defense of exoneration, a surety must allege in its answer a reasonable notice and demand to proceed against the principal, and prejudice resulting to the surety by reason of the failure of the creditor to do so.
