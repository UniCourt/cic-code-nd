        There is no requirement under North Dakota law that the nuisance be under the control of the defendant. Hebron Public School Dist. v. U.S. Gypsum, 690 F. Supp. 866, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7160 (D.N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t42c42-01s42-01-01" target="_self">42-01-01</a></cite>(1) is not void for vagueness, as it did not require incorporation of city’s municipal ordinances on nuisance to derive its legal meaning; the terms used in the statute have commonly understood meanings and are not so ambiguous that persons of common intelligence would have to guess at their meanings or differ as to their application.

   City of Fargo v. Salsman, 2009 ND 15, 760 N.W.2d 123, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 2009).

         “Coming to the Nuisance” Doctrine.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Any individual, corporation or partnership that comes to an alleged nuisance has a heavy burden to establish liability. Jerry Harmon Motors v. Farmers Union Grain Terminal Ass'n, 337 N.W.2d 427, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 378</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where automobile dealership alleged that feed plant’s discharge of dust, chaff, and grindings into the atmosphere and onto the dealership’s inventory of cars and trucks parked on its sale lot constituted a private nuisance, and the feed plant was in existence before the dealership was established in the proximity of the feed plant, the trial court should have applied the “coming to the nuisance” doctrine to the case. Jerry Harmon Motors v. Farmers Union Grain Terminal Ass'n, 337 N.W.2d 427, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 378</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>

   The doctrine of “coming to the nuisance” is a factor considered in determining whether a nuisance exists, along with all other evidence respecting reasonableness of use. Rassier v. Houim, 488 N.W.2d 635, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>

   Anyone who comes to a nuisance has a heavy burden to establish liability. Rassier v. Houim, 488 N.W.2d 635, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   The common-law nuisance concept does not apply because the legislature has enacted a statute defining a nuisance. Jerry Harmon Motors v. Farmers Union Grain Terminal Ass'n, 337 N.W.2d 427, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 378</cite> (N.D. 1983).

       </h5>
       <p>

   While the various factual circumstances of each case must be resolved before the rules of law may be applied to those circumstances to determine whether or not a nuisance exists, the ultimate resolution of whether or not a nuisance exists, based on the facts and circumstances of each case, is a conclusion of law. Jerry Harmon Motors v. Farmers Union Grain Terminal Ass'n, 337 N.W.2d 427, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 378</cite> (N.D. 1983).

         Duty.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Although this section defines nuisance in part as “omitting to perform a duty”, the type of “duty” which gives rise to a claim of nuisance may differ from the “duty” implicated in a negligence action. Knoff v. American Crystal Sugar Co., 380 N.W.2d 313, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   The duty whose breach gives rise to a nuisance claim is the absolute duty not to act in a way which unreasonably interferes with other persons’ use and enjoyment of their property. Rassier v. Houim, 488 N.W.2d 635, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Injured party could not recover under a theory that an obstruction on the land owner’s property presented a nuisance because the landowner was immune from liability under the North Dakota Recreational Use Statute, N.D.C.C. § 53-08-02, and the landowner thus did not owe the injured party any duty. Cudworth v. Midcontinent Communs., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6242 (D.N.D. Apr. 11, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tort of nuisance is defined by statute, and the duty which gives rise to a nuisance claim is the absolute duty not to act in a way which unreasonably interferes with other persons’ use and enjoyment of their property; an injured snowmobile rider and his wife did not state an actionable nuisance claim because they failed to allege or show that a barrier, which defendants had erected and which had caused the rider to become injured, was unlawfully on defendants’ land. Cudworth v. Midcontinent Communs., 380 F.3d 375, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 17859 (8th Cir. N.D. 2004).

   Kappenman v. Klipfel, 2009 ND 89, 765 N.W.2d 716, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 2009).

   Mineral lessee had no liability for nuisance under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.38.html#t38c38-11.1s38-11.1-06" target="_blank">38-11.1-06</a></cite> regarding its use of a flare because such use was required by N.D. Admin.

Noise, litter, and storage of equipment were not nuisances as a matter of law because they were not excessive; however, limited discovery was appropriate as to whether soil and water contamination had occurred.

   Kartch v. EOG Res., Inc., 845 F. Supp. 2d 995, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25851 (D.N.D. 2012).

         Erroneously Admitted Evidence.

       </h5>

   It was error to admit evidence of the general reputation and good deeds of a landowner who allegedly caused a nuisance because (1) this was irrelevant to the required inquiry into the utility of the nuisance, (2) the evidence was inadmissible as character evidence, and (3) neighbors did not “open the door” to such evidence.

        Plaintiff school district’s nuisance theory was improperly submitted to the jury and it might have been the theory on which the jury returned its verdict for plaintiff who sought to recover costs of removing acoustical plaster which contained asbestos and was manufactured by defendant; hence the judgment of the trial court was set aside and the case remanded for a new trial.

   Because the landowners failed to present competent evidence supporting their claim that the law enforcement shooting range posed a danger to their property, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment on the landowners’

   private nuisance claim; the landowner admitted he had no expertise about the weapons used at the shooting range and his speculation was not competent evidence.

   Factors relevant to the reasonableness of a defendant’s interference with the plaintiff’s use of property include a balancing of the utility of defendant’s conduct against the harm to the plaintiff, plaintiff’s attempts to accommodate defendant’s use before bringing the nuisance action, and plaintiff’s lack of diligence in seeking relief.

       Sport shooting range deemed not a nuisance.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a sport shooting range has been in operation for one year since the date on which it began operation as a sport shooting range, it does not become a public or private nuisance as a result of changed conditions in or around the locality of the sport shooting range. If a sport shooting range remains in compliance with noise control or nuisance abatement rules or ordinances in effect on the date on which it commenced operation, it is not subject to a civil or criminal action resulting from or relating to noise generated by the operation of the sport shooting range. A person who acquires title to real property that is adversely affected by the operation of a permanently located and improved sport shooting range constructed and initially operated before that person acquired title to the property adversely affected may not maintain a civil action on the basis of noise or noise pollution against the person who owns or operates the sport shooting range. A rule, resolution, or ordinance relating to noise control, noise pollution, or noise abatement adopted by the state or a political subdivision may not be applied to prohibit the operation of a sport shooting range, provided the conduct was lawful and being conducted before the adoption of the rule, resolution, or ordinance. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a political subdivision may regulate the location and construction of a sport shooting range after August 1, 1999. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a county or city enacting a home rule charter under chapter 11-09.1, 40-05.1, or 54-40.4 may not regulate a sport shooting range except as otherwise provided in this section. As used in this section, sport shooting range means an area designated and operated by a person for the sport shooting of firearms or any area so designated and operated by the state or a political subdivision, regardless of the terms for admission to the sport shooting range.

   City which maintained sanitary landfill in location such as to permit rains to send down onto plaintiffs’ property surface waters laden with silt and other material rendered plaintiffs insecure in use of their property and created a private nuisance, entitling plaintiffs to bring civil action for damages. Thorson v. Minot, 153 N.W.2d 764, 1967 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1967).

   Because the landowners failed to present competent evidence supporting their claim that the law enforcement shooting range posed a danger to their property, the district court did not err by granting summary judgment on the landowners’

   private nuisance claim; the landowner admitted he had no expertise about the weapons used at the shooting range and his speculation was not competent evidence.

   In an action brought by a city against a property owner, the district court did not err in ordering the owner to immediately abate a nuisance on his property by removing and disposing of all trash, rubbish, junk and junk automobiles and permanently enjoining the owner from maintaining a nuisance on the property; the city presented sufficient evidence to establish a nuisance on the owner’s land.

   City of Fargo v. Salsman, 2009 ND 15, 760 N.W.2d 123, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>

   When viewed in the light most favorable to the landowners, the maps, photographs and additional evidence raised a genuine issue whether the terrain surrounding the shooting range prevented bullets from exiting the shooting range; because the landowners raised a genuine issue of material fact whether bullets fired at the law enforcement shooting range exited the range, crossed County Road 12 and posed an unlawful danger, the district court erred by dismissing their public nuisance claim.

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t42c42-01s42-01-07" target="_self">42-01-07</a></cite> is a list of remedies available against a public nuisance and does not limit the remedies that may be sought against the same individual for the same nuisance to only one of the listed remedies; the phrases separated by the word “or” in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t42c42-01s42-01-07" target="_self">42-01-07</a></cite> do not have separate and independent significance, interpreting “or” as indicating mutually exclusive alternatives is unreasonable, and the word “remedies” is plural, which indicates more than one remedy may be pursued against a public nuisance. Therefore, a trial court did not err by refusing to dismiss a criminal nuisance action based on the fact that a civil nuisance action had also been filed against defendant.

   When viewed in the light most favorable to the landowners, the maps, photographs and additional evidence raised a genuine issue whether the terrain surrounding the shooting range prevented bullets from exiting the shooting range; because the landowners raised a genuine issue of material fact whether bullets fired at the law enforcement shooting range exited the range, crossed County Road 12 and posed an unlawful danger, the district court erred by dismissing their public nuisance claim.

   Plaintiffs, as private persons, were not entitled to maintain a claim for a public nuisance because they did not show that the alleged public nuisance of the law enforcement shooting range was specially injurious to them as plaintiff husband’s use of the county road adjacent to the shooting range once or twice a month to visit friends and the evidence of bullet holes in signs near the road did not demonstrate the range was specially injurious to him in a manner different from other members of the public.

   Any citizen of a county where a claimed nuisance exists is permitted to bring an action in the name of the state to abate and perpetually enjoin the nuisance; however, private persons may maintain a public nuisance claim in their own right or in the name of the state only if the claimed public nuisance is specially injurious to them, or their property, but not otherwise.

   District court did not err in amending its 2013 order to clarify that the nuisance on the property at issue remained subject to abatement after the former owner’s conveyance of the property to his children because the amended order simply more clearly described the property already subject to the 2013 order, the former owner’s argument that he complied with the 2013 order was foreclosed under the principles of res judicata where he had raised it in his prior appeal the 2013 order to the state supreme court, the time for appealing the 2014 order denying his motion to reconsider had passed, and the former owner conceded at oral argument that he was still operating the business that created the nuisance.

   The fact that the defendant could have been charged with a violation of N.D.C.C. § 42-11-01 did not negate the right of the state to charge him with a violation of this section and to seek the punishment prescribed under this statute. State v. Hafner, 1998 ND 220, 587 N.W.2d 177, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 230</cite> (N.D. 1998).

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t42c42-01s42-01-07" target="_self">42-01-07</a></cite> is a list of remedies available against a public nuisance and does not limit the remedies that may be sought against the same individual for the same nuisance to only one of the listed remedies; the phrases separated by the word “or” in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t42c42-01s42-01-07" target="_self">42-01-07</a></cite> do not have separate and independent significance, interpreting “or” as indicating mutually exclusive alternatives is unreasonable, and the word “remedies” is plural, which indicates more than one remedy may be pursued against a public nuisance. Therefore, a trial court did not err by refusing to dismiss a criminal nuisance action based on the fact that a civil nuisance action had also been filed against defendant.

   City had the authority to bring a nuisance abatement action against a property owner, as N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t42c42-02s42-02-01" target="_self">42-02-01</a></cite> does not give exclusive authority to the individuals listed to bring a nuisance abatement action but gives only those individuals the authority to bring the action in the name of the state; under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t42c42-01s42-01-09" target="_self">42-01-09</a></cite>, any public body or officer authorized by law may abate a public nuisance.

   Plaintiffs, as private persons, were not entitled to maintain a claim for a public nuisance because they did not show that the alleged public nuisance of the law enforcement shooting range was specially injurious to them as plaintiff husband’s use of the county road adjacent to the shooting range once or twice a month to visit friends and the evidence of bullet holes in signs near the road did not demonstrate the range was specially injurious to him in a manner different from other members of the public.

   Any citizen of a county where a claimed nuisance exists is permitted to bring an action in the name of the state to abate and perpetually enjoin the nuisance; however, private persons may maintain a public nuisance claim in their own right or in the name of the state only if the claimed public nuisance is specially injurious to them, or their property, but not otherwise.

   When an action is brought in the name of the state ex rel. the state’s attorney of a county, to restrain a nuisance, the state, as the real party in interest, is the plaintiff. The state’s attorney is an officer of the state and has no personal interest in such lawsuit. If, during the action, his term expires, his successor takes his place as the prosecutor of the action for the state. There is no change of parties. State ex rel. Nedrud v.

   Provision of this statute for the granting of a temporary injunction at the commencement of an action to abate a bawdyhouse nuisance is not unconstitutional as depriving a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.

After judgment, such officer publicly shall destroy the personal property used in keeping and maintaining the nuisance.

   The death of the person charged with maintaining a common nuisance abates the nuisance and the cause of action does not survive. State ex rel. Kelly v. McMaster, 13 N.D. 58, 99 N.W. 58, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 15</cite> (N.D. 1904).

       </h5>
       <p>

   In an action for the discontinuance of a bawdyhouse as a common nuisance, the court has no inherent authority to order the destruction of personal property kept and used in connection with its operation and maintenance. State ex rel. McCurdy v. Bennett, 37 N.D. 465, 163 N.W. 1063, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 1917).
       </p>
       <p>

   To seize and destroy personal property found in a disorderly house also used as the home of the defendant there must be evidence to show what personal property was used in the keeping and maintaining of the nuisance and a judicial determination thereon. State ex rel. Halvorson v. Simpson, 78 N.D. 440, 49 N.W.2d 790, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where less drastic means are available to correct or alleviate the problem, destruction of private property deemed a nuisance is an arbitrary act that is prohibited as a matter of law. City of Minot v. Freelander, 380 N.W.2d 321, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   Destruction of nuisance property is a drastic remedy, and it must necessarily be a remedy of last resort unless the property is of such nature that its use or possession cannot be other than for evil.

   It is discretionary with the trial court whether the building in which a nuisance was maintained by selling liquors therein, of which the owner had knowledge, shall be released to the owner after it is closed by appropriate proceedings.
