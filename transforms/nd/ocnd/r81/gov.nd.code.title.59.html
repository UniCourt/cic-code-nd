       If the amount of an estate tax marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes, and as a result estate taxes paid from principal are increased and income taxes paid by an estate, trust, or beneficiary are decreased, each estate, trust, or beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax shall reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid. The total reimbursement must equal the increase in the estate tax to the extent that the principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction but for the payment. The proportionate share of the reimbursement for each estate, trust, or beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced must be the same as its proportionate share of the total decrease in income tax. An estate or trust shall reimburse principal from income.

A third-party special needs trust must limit distributions in a manner and for purposes that supplement or complement publicly funded benefits for an individual with a disability. A third-party special needs trust may not have the effect of replacing, reducing, or substituting for publicly funded benefits otherwise available to a beneficiary with a disability or rendering a beneficiary with a disability ineligible for publicly funded benefits.

   District court erred in ruling this case moot; this action was commenced before the settlor died, and a beneficiary alleged improper gifting of trust property, plus a failure by the trustee to provide annual accountings as called for under the terms of the trust, and the settlor's death did not make it impossible for the court to provide effective relief.

       An organization that conducts activities through employees has notice or knowledge of a fact involving a trust only from the time the information was received by an employee having responsibility to act for the trust, or would have been brought to the employee’s attention if the organization had exercised reasonable diligence. An organization exercises reasonable diligence if the organization maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the employee having responsibility to act for the trust and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Reasonable diligence does not require an employee of the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual’s regular duties or the individual knows a matter involving the trust would be materially affected by the information.

   Trial court did not err in deciding that a brother did not hold a farmstead with an implied trust to allow his sister to reside on the property, consequently, the brother’s transfer of the property to his daughter was not in violation of a trust, resulting in any obligation upon the daughter under former

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t59c59-01s59-01-06" target="_self">59-01-06</a></cite>(3) [Repealed].

      </p>
      <p>
       In an action in which plaintiff beneficiary and cotrustee (beneficiary) filed suit against defendants, cotrustee and his wife, alleging wrongful use of trust funds, there was enough evidence to create an implied trust relationship and impose fiduciary duties pursuant to former N.D.C.C. § 59-01-08 (repealed by S.L. 2007, ch. 549, § 27) where (1) defendant cotrustee voluntarily entered into a relationship of personal confidence with the beneficiary pursuant to which he agreed to undertake certain fiduciary responsibilities with regard to her property; and (2) defendant cotrustee not only voluntarily entered into the relationship, he fostered and promoted it, including going so far as to set goals for his administration of the beneficiary’s financial affairs based on his trial testimony.

   Trial court properly denied a petition by a settlor’s son for supervised administration of a trust because the son conceded that he did not want the trial court to supervise the trust if it meant that the cost would have to be paid out of the corpus, in the event the income was insufficient to pay for court supervision; the son testified that the trustees had not done anything wrong.

   When a beneficiary sought to contest a trust modification, it was an abuse of discretion to enter summary judgment dismissing the beneficiary’s contest on grounds the 120 day contest period expired before suit was filed without giving the beneficiary an opportunity to conduct discovery because the presumption that the beneficiary received notice of the modification proceedings when delivered to the beneficiary’s last known address was rebuttable, as the presumption was not a statutory conclusive presumption, and the 120 day limitation period did not begin until receipt of notice, so the beneficiary was entitled to conduct discovery on why notice was sent to a prior address, especially since the limitation period was relatively short.

      If the court finds the settlor has executed the trust instrument and had the requisite capacity, the court shall declare the trust to be valid. An adjudication that a trust is valid is binding on the parties. If the court finds a trust or amendment to be invalid, the challenged trust or amendment is ineffective as of a date and to the extent determined by the court.

The term “presently exercisable general power of appointment” includes a testamentary general power of appointment having no conditions precedent to its exercise other than the death of the holder, the validity of the holder’s last will and testament, and the inclusion of a provision in the will sufficient to exercise this power.

      To the extent a beneficiary’s interest is not subject to a spendthrift provision, the court may authorize a creditor or assignee of the beneficiary to reach the beneficiary’s interest by attachment of present or future distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary or other means. The court may limit the award to such relief as is appropriate under the circumstances.

      <li id="t59c59-13s59-13-05ol11">
       The following rules apply whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision. During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor’s creditors to the extent that the property would be subject to creditors’ claims if the property had not been placed in the trust. With respect to an irrevocable trust, other than a special needs trust, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor’s benefit. If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor’s interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor’s contribution. After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlor’s right to direct the source from which liabilities will be paid, the property of a trust that was revocable immediately before the settlor’s death is subject to claims of the settlor’s creditors, costs of administration of the settlor’s estate, the expenses of the settlor’s funeral and disposal of remains, and statutory allowances to a surviving spouse and children to the extent the settlor’s probate estate is inadequate to satisfy those claims, costs, expenses, and allowances. For purposes of this section, “statutory allowances” includes any homestead exception under chapter 47-18 and the allowances included in title 30.1.

   Trial court was in the best position to weigh conflicting evidence and judge whether decedent had capacity to change bank accounts into joint tenancy accounts, and correctly concluded under former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t59c59-01s59-01-08" target="_self">59-01-08</a></cite> and former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t59c59-01s59-01-16" target="_self">59-01-16</a></cite> that change in the accounts was a transaction by which decedent’s son obtained an advantage from decedent which gave rise to a presumption of undue influence and shifted the burden to the son to prove the nonexistence of undue influence.

   Contract between fiduciary and some but not all interested parties, which was not made known to the court or other interested parties, was void as against public policy where the terms of the contract required the fiduciary to take certain action rather than exercise his discretionary power in consideration of which the interested parties would not oppose his appointment as fiduciary.

       “Appointed trust” means an irrevocable trust which receives principal from an invaded trust under this chapter, including a trust created by the settlor of the invaded trust, under the terms of the invaded trust or any other trust instrument, or by the trustees, acting in that capacity, of the invaded trust. For purposes of creating another trust, a requirement that a trust instrument be signed by the settlor is deemed satisfied by the signature of the trustee of the appointed trust.

       “Authorized trustee” means, as to an invaded trust, a trustee with authority to pay trust principal to or for one or more current beneficiaries other than a trustee who is the settlor, or a beneficiary to whom income or principal must be paid currently or in the future, or who is or will become eligible to receive a distribution of income or principal in the discretion of the trustee, other than by the exercise of a power of appointment held in a nonfiduciary capacity.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c59-16.1s59-16.1-02ol13">
       “Current beneficiary” or “beneficiaries” means individual, or as to a class, an individual who is or will become members of that class, to whom the trustees may distribute principal at the time of the exercise of the power, provided that the interest of a beneficiary to whom income, but not principal, may be distributed at the discretion of the trustee of the invaded trust, may be continued in the appointed trust.
      </li>
      <li id="t59c59-16.1s59-16.1-02ol14">
       “Invade” means the power to pay directly to the beneficiary of a trust or make application for the benefit of the beneficiary.

       For the first three accounting periods of the trust, the unitrust amount for a current valuation year of the trust may not be less than three percent, or more than five percent, by the election of the trustee, the disinterested person, or the court, of the net fair market value of the assets held in the trust on the valuation date of the current valuation year;
      </li>
      <li id="t59c59-16.3s59-16.3-06ol12">
       Beginning with the fourth accounting period of the trust, the unitrust amount for a current valuation year of the trust may not be less than three percent, or more than five percent, by the election of the trustee, the disinterested person, or the court, of the average of the net fair market value of the assets held in the trust on the valuation date of the current valuation year and the net fair market value of the assets held in the trust on the valuation date of each prior valuation year;

      <li id="t59c59-16.3s59-16.3-06ol13">
       The percentage that may be elected by the trustee, the disinterested person, or the court in determining the unitrust amount must be a reasonable current return from the trust, taking into account the intentions of the settlor as expressed in the governing instrument. However, the election by the trustee, the disinterested person, or the court in determining the unitrust amount may not be less than three percent, or more than five percent;
      </li>
      <li id="t59c59-16.3s59-16.3-06ol14">
       The unitrust amount for the current valuation year must be proportionately reduced for any distribution, in whole or in part, other than distributions of the unitrust amount, and for any payments of expenses, including debts, disbursements, and taxes, from the trust within a current valuation year which the trustee determines to be material and substantial, and must be proportionately increased for the receipt, other than a receipt that represents a return on investment, of any additional property into the trust within a current valuation year;

      <li id="t59c59-16.3s59-16.3-06ol15">

      </li>
      <li id="t59c59-16.3s59-16.3-06ol16">
       If the net fair market value of an asset held in the trust has been incorrectly determined either in a current valuation year or in a prior valuation year, the unitrust amount must be increased in the case of an undervaluation, or be decreased in the case of an overvaluation, by an amount equal to the difference between the unitrust amount determined based on the correct valuation of the asset and the unitrust amount originally determined;

     <p>
      A transaction between a trustee and the trust’s beneficiary during the existence of the trust or while the influence acquired by the trustee remains by which the trustee obtains any advantage from the trust’s beneficiary is presumed to be entered by the trust’s beneficiary without sufficient consideration and under undue influence.

   District court had to reconsider a denial of a son's petition to remove a personal representative of a father's decedent's estate because the court incorrectly found no basis for the son's misappropriation claims against daughters, as the court did not apply the presumption of undue influence arising when the daughters made withdrawals from the father's checking account, incorrectly presuming the decedent's lucidity at the time barred any finding of undue influence, since the daughters did not successfully rebut the presumption, and the withdrawals were presumably made under undue influence.

   Statutory presumption of undue influence is rebutted, as a matter of law, when a beneficiary of a trust, represented by independent counsel, enters into a stipulation with a trustee, and the trust's beneficiary acknowledges in open court he understands the terms of the stipulation. Harris v. Harris (In re Estate of Harris), 2017 ND 35, 890 N.W.2d 561, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 2017).

   Bill of transfer from the proponent’s parent to the proponent was void because the proponent did not overcome the statutory presumption of undue influence when a significant confidential relationship existed in that the proponent’s parent relied to a significant extent on the proponent for care, transportation, and the management of the parent’s affairs. Evidence showed the proponent’s opportunity to influence the parent, the parent’s susceptibility to undue influence, and the proponent’s disposition to exercise undue influence over the parent.

   This section offers the trustee protection against personal liability only when the trustee executes the instrument “in the course of the administration of a trust”; if the trustee’s act is outside the authority conferred in the instrument of trust, both the common law and this section make the trustee personally liable for any resulting damages.
