   The owner of property is the one who has dominion of a thing, real or personal, corporeal or incorporeal, which he has a right to enjoy as he pleases, and to spoil or destroy it as far as the law permits, unless he is prevented by some agreement or covenant which restrains his right. Fleming v. Sherwood, 24 N.D. 144, 139 N.W. 101, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 17</cite> (N.D. 1912).

   Ownership is the right by which a thing belongs to an individual to the exclusion of all other persons. Fleming v. Sherwood, 24 N.D. 144, 139 N.W. 101, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 17</cite> (N.D. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>

   That which may be owned is property, and rights granted by statute may be owned. Iszler v. Jorda, 80 N.W.2d 665, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1957).

   The term “possessed and used” is broader than the term “title” or the term “possession” and includes both. Fleming v. Sherwood, 24 N.D. 144, 139 N.W. 101, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 17</cite> (N.D. 1912).

   Real property consists not only of land, but also of that which is affixed to land, that which is incidental or appurtenant to land, and that which is immovable by law. Mueller v. Mercer County, 60 N.W.2d 678, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1953).

       <p>
        In an adversary proceeding seeking a declaration of rights under a gas and oil lease service agreement, the service agreement did not run with the land because it was not enough for the parties to call something a covenant that ran with the land, it was not an easement that was an estate in property or appurtenant to property, and the right to control produced oil and gas was not the grant of an interest in real property.

   The interest of a desert-land entryman in public lands prior to his acquisition of a completed equitable title thereto is real property. Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Dist. v. Nelson, 71 N.D. 439, 2 N.W.2d 180, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 1941).

       </h5>
       <p>

   The term “real estate” means an estate in fee or for life in land, and does not comprehend terms for years or any interest short of a freehold. Sox v. Miracle, 35 N.D. 458, 160 N.W. 716, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 1916).
       </p>
       <p>

   Because a lessee was capable of closing within a reasonable time, and a decedent’s estate was unwilling to close on property, the lessee’s delay in performance was reasonable, and the district court’s finding that his was capable of closing on the property within a reasonable time from the execution of the agreement to purchase the property was not clearly erroneous; the lessee’s delay in performance was not unreasonable, and there was not a failure of consideration. Hartman v. Grager, 2021 ND 160, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 162</cite> (N.D. 2021).

         Determination of Fixture.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   An agreement that an article annexed to realty may be removed by the tenant, thereby rendering inapplicable the common-law rules governing fixtures, may be entered into after annexation. Warner v. Intlehouse, 60 N.D. 542, 235 N.W. 638, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>

   In determining whether personal property became a fixture under the statute, the court will look into the intention of the persons making the annexation, the manner in which the article or building is annexed, and its adaptation to the use of realty. Gray v. Krieger, 66 N.D. 115, 262 N.W. 343, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>

   In determining whether personalty has become a fixture under this section, court will look to intention of person making the annexation, the manner in which building is annexed, and its adaptation to use of realty. Strobel v. Northwest G. F. Mut. Ins. Co., 152 N.W.2d 794, 1967 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>

   Notwithstanding the physical characteristics of a fixture, the parties may agree that it is personal property; however, such an agreement is not binding upon subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith, without notice of the agreement. Conversely, a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee who joins in or has notice of the agreement is ordinarily bound thereby. Lundgren v. Mohagen, 426 N.W.2d 563, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   The determination whether there has been an agreement to treat fixtures as personalty is a question of fact. Marsh v. Binstock, 462 N.W.2d 172, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   Notwithstanding the physical characteristics of a fixture, parties may agree to give it the legal character of personalty. Marsh v. Binstock, 462 N.W.2d 172, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where contract for deed valued milking equipment at $8,000, and tax statement filed at time of sale stated that personal property valued at $8,000 was included, issue of material fact existed concerning whether vendor and purchaser agreed to treat milking equipment attached to barn as personalty precluding summary judgment in conversion action arising when equipment was sold by purchaser. Marsh v. Binstock, 462 N.W.2d 172, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>

   House was considered a fixture while it was being raised to have the foundation replaced where the intention was to have the house remain on the property permanently. Grinnell Mut. Reinsurance Co. v. Lynne, 2004 ND 166, 686 N.W.2d 118, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 293</cite> (N.D. 2004).

         “Improvement to Real Property.”
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   It was unnecessary to define the term “improvement to real property” because only one conclusion — that the grain bin was an improvement to real property — could reasonably be drawn, where the bin was a 10,000-bushel bin anchored to a cement slab by bolts, with a perforated floor nine inches above the cement slab upon which the bin rested, part of a grain-handling system which also consisted of two additional 10,000-bushel bins, a 3,500-bushel overhead bin, two hopper bins, and a leg, and since the bin was erected in 1967, the owner had never moved it or removed any of the anchors. Bellemare v. Gateway Builders, 420 N.W.2d 733, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Under a statute including as realty what is affixed to the land, and providing that it is deemed to be affixed when permanently resting on it, the term “permanently resting” contrasts with transient or temporary. Nelson v. Kloster, 68 N.D. 108, 277 N.W. 390, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1938).

         Railroad Tracks.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   While it may be true that railroad tracks are generally held to be personal property, when railroad tracks are placed on mining property a disputable presumption arises that they are part of the realty and an agreement to make them personal property is binding on a purchaser only if the purchaser has notice, actual or constructive, thereof. Burlington N. R.R. v. Scheid, 398 N.W.2d 114, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 444</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Parties may by agreement give to fixtures the legal character of realty or personalty at their option. Burlington N. R.R. v. Scheid, 398 N.W.2d 114, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 444</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   Whether or not an agreement to treat fixtures as personalty is binding on a purchaser of the land depends on notice of the agreement to the purchaser. Burlington N. R.R. v. Scheid, 398 N.W.2d 114, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 444</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   An agreement to give fixtures the legal character of personalty avails as against a purchaser of the land with notice thereof, actual or constructive. Burlington N. R.R. v. Scheid, 398 N.W.2d 114, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 444</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   When an owner of realty and fixtures sells the fixtures separate from the real estate, a constructive severance occurs and the fixtures become personal property. Marsh v. Binstock, 462 N.W.2d 172, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Because a lessee was capable of closing within a reasonable time, and a decedent’s estate was unwilling to close on property, the lessee’s delay in performance was reasonable, and the district court’s finding that his was capable of closing on the property within a reasonable time from the execution of the agreement to purchase the property was not clearly erroneous; the lessee’s delay in performance was not unreasonable, and there was not a failure of consideration.

   A light plant in the basement of a farm dwelling house, with necessary equipment, and a hay carrier attached to a barn, with necessary equipment, are fixtures. Klocke v. Troske, 57 N.D. 404, 222 N.W. 262, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>

   Windmills, wells, and fences ordinarily are fixtures. Hasse v. Dewitz, 76 N.D. 108, 33 N.W.2d 625, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>

   Barn which was purchased and moved onto purchaser’s land and placed on blocks was not affixed to land as fixture but was personalty; purchaser had insurable interest in barn under fire policy even though land had been lost on execution sale before barn burned. Strobel v. Northwest G. F. Mut. Ins. Co., 152 N.W.2d 794, 1967 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1967).
       </p>
       <p>

   At time of sale, physical characteristics of milking equipment were characteristic of fixtures as equipment was permanently attached to barn by screws, electric wiring and separate piping for water and freon and equipment was specifically adapted to the use of the realty. Marsh v. Binstock, 462 N.W.2d 172, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Defendant insured’s modular units as assembled and affixed to foundations for a motel were “real property” under this section and N.D.C.C. §§ 47-01-02 and 47-01-03; they therefore fell within the real property exception to the “damage to your product exclusion” in plaintiff insurer’s general liability policy.

   Absent a contrary intent, the grant under which the [riparian] land is held includes a riparian grantee’s full interest in the shore zone, and necessarily precludes the state’s claim of absolute ownership to the high watermark; however, the equal footing and public trust doctrines establish that the state cannot totally abdicate its interest to the high watermark, and that a riparian landowner’s interest to the law watermark is not absolute.

       </h5>
       <p>
        While federal law extends an upland owner’s rights only to the ordinary high water mark, North Dakota law provides that an upland owner “takes to the edge of the lake … at low watermark.”101 Ranch v. United States, 714 F. Supp. 1005, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16413 (D.N.D. 1988), aff'd, 905 F.2d 180, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 8644 (8th Cir. N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not entirely clear from the language of this section whether it grants upland owners title or only a license or easement down to the ordinary low watermark, but it is apparent that North Dakota law would extend some interest or rights to upland owners not provided under federal law. 101 Ranch v. United States, 714 F. Supp. 1005, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16413 (D.N.D. 1988), aff'd, 905 F.2d 180, 1990 U.S. App. LEXIS 8644 (8th Cir. N.D. 1990).

   Where an irregular tract of land abuts upon a stream, and a meander line is run ostensibly along the shore line for the purpose of fixing the area of this tract, the real boundary is the shore line and not the meander line.

   Although a riparian landowner may claim absolute ownership of the land above the ordinary high watermark and the state may claim absolute ownership of the land below the ordinary low watermark via the public trust and equal footing doctrines, those doctrines and this section do not contemplate absolute ownership of the shore zone by either party; both parties have correlative interests in the shore zone. Under the public trust and equal footing doctrines, the state has interests in the shore zone which involve more than a navigational servitude, and under this section a riparian owner “takes” more than the mere right of access to the water. State ex rel. Sprynczynatyk v. Mills, 523 N.W.2d 537, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 224</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>

   State owned the mineral interests under the shore zone of navigable waters upon statehood in 1889 under the equal footing doctrine, and the enduring language of the anti-gift clause found in N.D. Const. art. X, § 18 precluded construing the language codified in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-01s47-01-15" target="_self">47-01-15</a></cite> as a gift of the State’s mineral interests under the shore zone to the upland owners; however, an upland owner was not precluded from taking to the low watermark if the chain of title established that the State had granted its equal footing interest to an upland owner.

   Court properly granted summary judgment to an insurer in a declaratory judgment action where a semi-truck was not covered under a farmer’s policy because an exclusion contained limited exceptions which did not provide coverage for motor vehicles on public roads or highways.

   The semi-truck was indisputably driven on public roads and it was irrelevant whether the state’s interest in highway abutting insured’s property was treated as an easement or a fee interest and N.D.C.C. §

   <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-01s47-01-16" target="_self">47-01-16</a></cite> did not operate to extend coverage, as the collision occurred more than two miles from the insured’s farm, and the driver had to cross several strips of highway that did not abut land owned by insured.

   The language of the policy precluded coverage for the semi-truck because it was designed for travel on public roads and subject to motor vehicle registration. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Cos. v. Lagodinski, 2004 ND 147, 683 N.W.2d 903, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 279</cite> (N.D. 2004).

   Where removal of lateral support has affected a building or other structure on adjoining land, this section, which applies only to the support of “land”, does not alter the common law, and in order to incur liability, the excavating owner must have failed to use ordinary care and skill in accomplishing his task.

   This section does not grant to real property owners an absolute right to lateral support of their land, but rather a right to such support “subject to” the rights of adjoining landowners to excavate, provided they limit the excavation to those things which are proper and usual, do the work with ordinary care and skill, take precautions to sustain their neighbor’s land, and give the neighbor reasonable notice of their intent to excavate; but where an excavator fails to comply with any of the above conditions, he will be absolutely liable for any damages which result to his neighbor’s land, as at common law.

   Possession does not constitute title, at least not until it has ripened into title, or adverse actions are barred by the statute of limitations. The fact that possession furnishes a presumption of title does not preclude the adverse party from showing a lack of title. Goss v. Herman, 20 N.D. 295, 127 N.W. 78, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 1910).
      </p>
      <p>

   The right to maintain an action to remove a cloud upon the title to a nonpossessory interest in real property is a continuing right and a statute of limitations affecting such a right of action does not commence to run as long as the possession of the property is consistent with the nonpossessory interest. Yttredahl v. Federal Farm Mtg. Corp., 104 N.W.2d 705 (N.D. 1960); Wisness v. Paniman, 120 N.W.2d 594, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 1963).

   District court erred in ruling that the Department of Human Services was entitled to 100 percent of the net sale proceeds from the sale of a decedent’s home to pay for medical assistance benefits previously received by his deceased spouse because the Department’s recovery from a deceased Medicaid recipient’s joint tenancy property was limited to the deceased recipient’s fractional interest in the property.

   A joint tenant who survives does not take the moiety of the other tenant from him or as his successor, but takes it by right under the conveyance or instrument by which the joint tenancy was created. In re Estate of Kaspari, 71 N.W.2d 558, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1955).

   Joint tenancy real property became the property of the widow upon the death of her husband by right of survivorship and not by the will of the deceased husband. In re Estate of Kaspari, 71 N.W.2d 558, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1955).

   Although creditors of decedent might have levied upon decedent’s interest in the real estate during his lifetime, upon his death title passes to the survivor subject only to payment of estate taxes. Schlichenmayer v. Luithle, 221 N.W.2d 77, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>

   Real property owned by joint tenancy became property of widow on death of her husband by right of survivorship, and provision of will which purported to give widow life estate with remainder to husband’s children was void, since husband had no interest in property which he could devise. Cranston v. Winters, 238 N.W.2d 647, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>

   Each joint tenant with a right of survivorship holds what amounts to a life estate with a remainder in fee contingent upon survival of the other joint tenant; thus, each joint tenant has a contingent fee estate from the time of the creation of the tenancy and the survivor takes nothing from the estate of the other upon his death; therefore, where husband and wife held all their property jointly and had done so since its acquisition, upon the death of the husband-debtor there was nothing on which a writ of execution could operate, and such writ was properly quashed. Jamestown Terminal Elevator v. Knopp, 246 N.W.2d 612, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1976).

        Oil and Gas Leases.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Interests in oil and gas leases are interests in real property, and may be subject to the rule against perpetuities in proper cases. But the usual lease for a term of years and so long thereafter as oil and gas is produced is seemingly impregnable under the rule. Nevertheless, there are some interests related to oil and gas leasing where sufficiently definitive decisional law has not accumulated to “settle” the subject. “Top leasing” is apparently one of them. Nantt v. Puckett Energy Co., 382 N.W.2d 655, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 263</cite> (N.D. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>

   Since there was no extension of bottom leases by production, no violation of the rule against perpetuities by indefinite suspension of defendant’s possession of oil and gas rights under its top leases occurred. Nantt v. Puckett Energy Co., 382 N.W.2d 655, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 263</cite> (N.D. 1986).

      </p>
      <p>

   When a testator’s primary and dominant purpose is completely expressed in the trust provisions of the will, independent of any provisions that are void as against the statute on perpetuities, such portion expressing the primary intent of the testator will be held valid so as to carry out the testator’s intention as far as possible.

        Rule Against Perpetuities.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Strictly speaking, in this state there is no statute against perpetuities. The common-law rule against perpetuities is not in force in this state as statutes dealing with restraints on alienation are found in this chapter. Anderson v. Blixt, 72 N.W.2d 799, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1955).

       <b>
        Suspension of Power of Alienation.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   An active or express trust suspends the absolute power of alienation during its continuance, and such a trust is therefore void when it is to continue for longer than lives in being at the death of the testator. Penfield v. Tower, 1 N.D. 216, 46 N.W. 413, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 1890); Hull v. Rolfsrud, 65 N.W.2d 94, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>

   Every estate, present or future, which suspends the power of alienation is void. Penfield v. Tower, 1 N.D. 216, 46 N.W. 413, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 1890).
      </p>
      <p>

   If there is any possibility that the suspension may continue beyond the statutory limit, the suspension is void. Carlson v. Tioga Holding Co., 72 N.W.2d 236, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>

   A direction in a will giving the executor discretion as to when he shall sell the land and distribute the proceeds is valid, since the power of alienation is not suspended, though it may not be exercised during the period. Hagen v. Sacrison, 19 N.D. 160, 123 N.W. 518, 1909 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>

   A devise over, in case the devisee should refuse to accept the devise if not made subject to a condition precedent, does not suspend the power of alienation. In re Gray's Estate, 27 N.D. 417, 146 N.W. 722, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 55</cite> (N.D. 1914).
      </p>
      <p>

   If a testamentary trust suspends the power of the alienation of property beyond the time permitted by the statute against perpetuities in force at the time of the creation of the trust, such trust is invalid. Hull v. Rolfsrud, 65 N.W.2d 94, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>

   The test as to whether the absolute power of alienation has been suspended beyond the statutory limit is whether there is any possibility that the suspension may continue beyond it. If such possibility exists the suspension is void. Carlson v. Tioga Holding Co., 72 N.W.2d 236, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>

   The absolute power of alienation is suspended when there are no persons in being by whom an absolute interest in possession can be conveyed. Carlson v. Tioga Holding Co., 72 N.W.2d 236, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>

   A trust instrument which requires the trustee to hold real property intact for the duration of the trust and to distribute the rents and profits thereof to the beneficiaries of the trust suspends the absolute power of alienation during the continuance of the trust. Carlson v. Tioga Holding Co., 72 N.W.2d 236, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1955).
      </p>
      <p>

   A trust which suspends the absolute power of alienation for ten years and for as long thereafter as oil and gas may be produced upon the trust property suspends the power of alienation beyond the statutory limit. Carlson v. Tioga Holding Co., 72 N.W.2d 236, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1955).

        Trust to Provide Income for Beneficiaries.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   A trust created by will, which was to run for fifteen years, with an optional provision for an additional five years, and which did not become effective until twelve years after the testator’s death, did not violate rule against perpetuities where all the beneficiaries of the trust were in being at the time of the testator’s death. In such case, the lives of the beneficiaries provided the required limitation on suspension of alienability. In re Montgomery, 144 N.W.2d 382, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   The owner of a life estate must do no act to injure the inheritance. Roach v. McKee, 66 N.D. 304, 265 N.W. 264, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>

   Because the deed creating the life estate in the life tenant only reserved the minerals in the property and did not reserve the surface, and the deed did not contain any language excluding application of the doctrine, it was clear that the open mines doctrine applied. Thus, the life tenant was entitled to the proceeds from the oil and gas production, including the royalties and bonus payments, and she was not required to hold the proceeds in trust for the remainderman. The district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the remainderman. Reese v. Reese-Young, 2020 ND 35, 938 N.W.2d 405, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 34</cite> (N.D. 2020).

   Open mines doctrine was a common law doctrine adopted as the law in North Dakota as it did not conflict with any statutory law, including the duties and relationship between life tenants and remaindermen in N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-02s47-02-33" target="_self">47-02-33</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-04s47-04-22" target="_self">47-04-22</a></cite>.

   In a dispute between siblings over a trust, the trial court correctly determined that the trust instrument was not ambiguous as to the creation of life estate interests for defendant trustees; in accordance with N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-02s47-02-33" target="_self">47-02-33</a></cite>, defendants were entitled to profits from the trust lands during their lifetimes.

   Court did not err in finding the planned unit development (PUD) had authority to impose assessments against the owner’s property, because the owner’s warranty deed plainly stated in its legal description that her property was within the PUD, and the amended declaration for the PUD was recorded and the owner was charged with constructive notice of its contents, including provisions imposing covenants running with her property; the owner’s obligations to the PUD were imposed by the covenants running with the land and she was bound by the amended declaration’s relevant provisions by the purchase of her property within the development.

   A future estate is a remainder only when it cannot be a reversion, and it cannot be both at the same time. Sailer v. Mercer County, 75 N.D. 123, 26 N.W.2d 137, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 1947).

   District court erred in holding that the intent of the original parties to a deed was controlling and created a perpetual covenant for payments to the sellers of a portion of waste disposal fees generated from a landfill upon the subject property that was binding upon the successor to the buyer’s interest because the covenant did not benefit the land and did not run with the land.

   Court did not err in finding the planned unit development (PUD) had authority to impose assessments against the owner’s property, because the owner’s warranty deed plainly stated in its legal description that her property was within the PUD, and the amended declaration for the PUD was recorded and the owner was charged with constructive notice of its contents, including provisions imposing covenants running with her property; the owner’s obligations to the PUD were imposed by the covenants running with the land and she was bound by the amended declaration’s relevant provisions by the purchase of her property within the development.

   Court did not err in finding the planned unit development (PUD) had authority to impose assessments against the owner’s property, because the owner’s warranty deed plainly stated in its legal description that her property was within the PUD, and the amended declaration for the PUD was recorded and the owner was charged with constructive notice of its contents, including provisions imposing covenants running with her property; the owner’s obligations to the PUD were imposed by the covenants running with the land and she was bound by the amended declaration’s relevant provisions by the purchase of her property within the development.

   District court erred in holding that the intent of the original parties to a deed was controlling and created a perpetual covenant for payments to the sellers of a portion of waste disposal fees generated from a landfill upon the subject property that was binding upon the successor to the buyer’s interest because the covenant did not benefit the land and did not run with the land.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A covenant running with the land executed after August 1, 1997, must contain provisions addressing the modification of the covenant. If a covenant running with the land does not contain provisions relating to the modification of the covenant, eighty-five percent of all of the owners of the real property subject to the covenant may agree, in writing, to amend the covenant to include provisions relating to the modification of the covenant. Following approval of any modification, the modified covenant must be filed for recording with the recorder. This section does not apply to subdivisions that are not completed unless the subdivision has been in development for over fifteen years.

   This section prohibited the retroactive application of an amendment to the declaration of restrictions, which prohibited the leasing of the condominium units to nonowners except in limited circumstances, to those persons who had purchased a unit prior to the promulgation of the amendment and who had not acquiesced in such amendment.

   A prerequisite to the enforceability of a restriction is that the restriction be recorded prior to the conveyance of any condominium unit; restriction adopted after the purchase of a condominium unit would not be enforceable against the purchaser except through the purchaser’s acquiescence. Breene v. Plaza Tower Ass'n, 310 N.W.2d 730, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 326</cite> (N.D. 1981).

   Condominium association had standing to intervene in a declaratory judgment action to determine what party was entitled to insurance proceeds arising out of damage done to its condominium complex roof, as it had associational standing because it was tasked with representing the interests of its members who lived in the condominium complex. Under the law governing condominiums, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-04.1s47-04.1-01" target="_self">47-04.1-01</a></cite> et seq., it had to record restrictions that were enforceable against any condominium unit owner, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-04.1s47-04.1-04" target="_self">47-04.1-04</a></cite>, and it had to administer its bylaws to operate the condominium complex for the benefit of its members, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-04.1s47-04.1-07" target="_self">47-04.1-07</a></cite>(1), which included fixing the roof for the benefit of its members.

   A condominium combines two distinct forms of ownership of real property: (1) exclusive ownership of an individual unit of a multi-unit condominium project, and (2) ownership as a tenant in common of the common area of the project, in proportion to each unit’s interest in the total project.

   Where condominium association filed a Declaration of Project, and it later amended its declaration to restrict pet ownership and where the declaration of covenants and restrictions specified that the association’s bylaws were annexed to the declaration, there was no support for plaintiff pet owner’s argument that the amendments that prohibited pet ownership were not properly adopted, or for his argument that 100 percent of the mortgage owners must have approved the amendments as it was undisputed that the by-laws allowed for amendments with approval of a two-thirds majority.

   Bylaws have to relate to “maintenance of common elements, limited elements where applicable, assessment of expenses, payment of losses, division of profits, disposition of hazard insurance proceeds and similar matters”; prohibiting unit owners from leasing of a unit to nonowners is not within the scope of the subject matter of a bylaw and is, instead, governed by the provisions of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-04.1s47-04.1-04" target="_self">47-04.1-04</a></cite>, relating to restrictions.

   Condominium association had standing to intervene in a declaratory judgment action to determine what party was entitled to insurance proceeds arising out of damage done to its condominium complex roof, as it had associational standing because it was tasked with representing the interests of its members who lived in the condominium complex. Under the law governing condominiums, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-04.1s47-04.1-01" target="_self">47-04.1-01</a></cite> et seq., it had to record restrictions that were enforceable against any condominium unit owner, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-04.1s47-04.1-04" target="_self">47-04.1-04</a></cite>, and it had to administer its bylaws to operate the condominium complex for the benefit of its members, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-04.1s47-04.1-07" target="_self">47-04.1-07</a></cite>(1), which included fixing the roof for the benefit of its members.

   Where condominium association filed a Declaration of Project, and it later amended its declaration to restrict pet ownership and where the declaration of covenants and restrictions specified that the association’s bylaws were annexed to the declaration, there was no support for plaintiff pet owner’s argument that the amendments that prohibited pet ownership were not properly adopted, or for his argument that 100 percent of the mortgage owners must have approved the amendments as it was undisputed that the by-laws allowed for amendments with approval of a two-thirds majority.

   Summary judgment was properly entered against appellant in a case alleging trespass and other causes of action because a 1953 permit issued to another constituted an easement, rather than a license, since it was not revocable at the will of a landowner; under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-10s47-10-11" target="_self">47-10-11</a></cite>, a transfer of real property passed all easements, but a license was generally not assignable.

   Warranty deed did not create or reserve an express roadway easement by using the words “subject to” because they connoted a limitation on a grantor’s warranty, and not a reservation of rights. The evidence permitted an inference that a dirt trail was in existence before the warranty deed at issue was executed and that the grantor intended to limit the warranty because of the possible existence of an implied easement.

   April 2007 pipeline easement was ambiguous, and the district court erred in construing the easement as a matter of law. However, the district court did not err in ruling that an energy company's use of plaintiff's private road to access a second pipeline on plaintiffs' land was not authorized by a 2008 road use agreement and was a trespass.

   If an easement over a neighboring lot is ultimately found to be necessary, the landowner is not automatically entitled to access giving him the “best” use of his land; rather, the scope of the easement granted depends not only on necessity, but also on whether it is consistent with the full reasonable enjoyment of the servient estate (i.e., the neighboring lot).

         Question of Fact.

       </h5>
       <p>

   The determination of whether a particular use of an easement is reasonable is a question of fact. The supreme court’s review thereof is therefore limited to a determination of whether the finding is clearly erroneous. Radspinner v. Charlesworth, 369 N.W.2d 109, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 332</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Extent of an express easement must be determined by the terms of the grant; however, it may be necessary for the court to look at custom and usage to determine what was meant by the general terms used in the grant at the time it was executed.

   Where land was held in joint tenancy by husband and wife and husband’s will made ineffective attempt to give wife a life estate with remainder to his children by a previous marriage, wife’s possession of the property after husband’s death and brief possession by his children thereafter did not pass title to children by adverse possession since wife’s possession was not hostile to interests of her sisters who were her heirs as well as her residuary devisees, there being no reason for sisters to believe that she was other than fee owner.

   Since the only “title” instrument under which a partnership could make an adverse possession claim under this provision was the unrecorded purchase memorandum it received from the defendant, and its ownership claim was therefore “by, through, or under” the defendant, its adverse possession claim against the adjacent lot’s owner constituted a breach of the defendant’s special warranty against claims against title by, under, or through himself, and provided the legal basis for an award of damages to the adjacent lot’s owner. State Bank &amp; Trust v. Brekke, 1999 ND 212, 602 N.W.2d 681, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 230</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>

   The person claiming property by adverse possession by virtue of a title has the burden to prove that he, either alone or including those under whom he claims, has been in actual open adverse and undisputed possession for a period of ten years and that he, either alone or including those under whom he claims, has paid all taxes and assessments legally levied thereon for such period. Simons v. Tancre, 321 N.W.2d 495, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 286</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   The burden of proving adverse possession rests with the person alleging it and must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Benson v. Taralseth, 382 N.W.2d 649, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 265</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   Quieting title to property in favor of property owners and dismissal of a neighbor's claim for adverse possession was appropriate because the neighbor failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the neighbor, or the neighbor's predecessors-in-interest, had actual, visible, and continuous possession of the disputed property for the required period of time. Moody v. Sundley, 2015 ND 204, 868 N.W.2d 491, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 2015).

   Mere possession itself and the payment of taxes by a tenant in common is presumed to be for the benefit of all tenants in common, and the appropriation of rents and profits will not constitute adverse possession on the part of a tenant in common.

   A cotenant may hold adversely to other cotenants if his possession is such that it meets the requirements of the law of adverse possession; while one cotenant may oust another, it must be by acts so distinctly hostile to the rights of the other cotenants that the intent to dispossess is clear and unmistakable.

   Cotenant’s recording of oil and gas leases in which he was the only lessor, an affidavit stating that he was the sole and only owner, and a contract for deed for the entire property in which he was the only grantor constituted only constructive notice of his ouster of the other cotenants and was not sufficient notice to establish a hostile ouster for purposes of establishing title by adverse possession against his other cotenants.

   One who is in adverse possession of land and who later and upon the death of the owner, intestate, acquires by inheritance an interest therein as a cotenant with other heirs but continues in exclusive possession under his original adverse entry is not required to perform any other or further act of ouster in order to maintain his adverse possession against his cotenants.

   Where there is a severance of the mineral estate from the surface, the title to one cannot be acquired by adverse possession of the other, and possession of the surface estate under color of title with payment of taxes for the statutory period does not constitute possession of the severed mineral estate and is not adverse to the title holder of the mineral estate.

       <p>

   Where the mineral estate had been severed from the surface estate, possession of the surface estate by a party and her predecessors in interest did not constitute possession of the severed mineral estate sufficient for adverse possession; such party and her predecessors in interest would need to have had open, adverse, and undisputed possession of the mineral estate for a period of ten years in order to claim title to the mineral estate by adverse possession.

       Fixtures — When tenant may remove.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a person affixes that person’s property to the land of another without an agreement permitting that person to remove it, the thing affixed belongs to the owner of the land, unless the owner of the land chooses to require the former to remove it. A tenant may remove from the demised premises, anytime during the continuance of the tenant’s term, anything affixed thereto, for the purpose of trade, manufacture, ornament, or domestic use, if the removal can be effected without injury to the premises, unless the thing has become an integral part of the premises by the manner in which it is affixed. When any tenant upon agricultural land shall have built, erected, or placed upon such leased premises during the tenant’s tenancy, any grain bin, granary, or structure for the purpose of housing grain, and no written agreement between the landlord and the tenant has been made as to its removal, the tenant may remove the same at any time within eight months after the termination of the tenant’s lease and the vacating of said premises. The tenant shall not have said right of removal as against the owner or holder of any mortgage, deed, or conveyance which shall have been filed and recorded after the building, erection, or placing of such bin, granary, or structure, unless such tenant, within sixty days after such building, erecting, or placing, shall have filed in the office of the recorder a written notice describing the land, the character of the structure, and stating that the tenant intends to remove such structure as provided by law.

   By agreement the parties concerned may give fixtures the legal character of realty or personalty, and such agreement will be enforced so long as the rights of third parties are not prejudiced thereby. Myrick v. Bill, 17 N.W. 268, 3 Dakota 284, 1883 Dakota LEXIS 3 (Dakota 1883); Warner v. Intlehouse, 60 N.D. 542, 235 N.W. 638, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1931).

   The determination of whether or not items are trade fixtures is a question of law. Schnaible v. Bismarck, 275 N.W.2d 859, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1979).

   Owner of trade fixtures is entitled to just compensation from the condemnor if such fixtures are taken or damaged as a result of a condemnation; fact that owner of trade fixtures removes such fixtures subsequent to the condemnation does not deny him his right to compensation for damage to the fixtures resulting from the condemnation. Schnaible v. Bismarck, 275 N.W.2d 859, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1979).

   Heating apparatus constituted trade fixtures, where it was not permanently and irrevocably attached to building but was affixed simply by bolts, and was removed without causing any substantial damage to the building, as an adequate heating system is a sine qua non to the operation of a theater, since when a tenant installs fixtures in furtherance of his own purposes, there is a presumption that they are intended to be trade fixtures. R &amp; D Amusement Corp. v. Christianson, 392 N.W.2d 385, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 382</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   The fact that there was an agreement between the mortgagor and the seller of a light plant, that until the plant was paid for it should be considered chattel property, did not affect the rights of the mortgagees of the real estate or those claiming under them, as against the mortgagor.

   That which is affixed to land is real property and if property is affixed to the land of another without agreement permitting its removal, it belongs to the owner of the land unless he chooses to require its removal, except as otherwise provided by this section. Gussner v. Mandan Creamery &amp; Produce Co., 78 N.D. 594, 51 N.W.2d 352, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section is liberally construed in favor of the right of a tenant to remove trade fixtures and when the tenancy is terminated for reasons other than the expiration of the full term, the right to remove trade fixtures must be exercised within a reasonable time after termination. Gussner v. Mandan Creamery &amp; Produce Co., 78 N.D. 594, 51 N.W.2d 352, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>

   A fence placed on the property of another is the property of the landowner unless he chooses to require its removal, but if he requires its removal, then later tears it down and refuses to give it up to the true owner upon demand, he is guilty of conversion. Frank v. Schaff, 123 N.W.2d 827, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>

   The right of an outgoing tenant to remove trade fixtures is based upon the sound policy of encouraging trade and industry by allowing tenants to make the most beneficial use of the leased premises. Otherwise, a tenant would hesitate to undergo large expenditures in installing the necessities of his trade, if ownership of these articles would pass to the landlord by operation of law. R &amp; D Amusement Corp. v. Christianson, 392 N.W.2d 385, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 382</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>

   In order for an agricultural tenant to preserve the right to remove a grain bin against a holder of a mortgage recorded after the erection of the bin, the tenant must file a description of the bin and a notice of his or her intent to remove it with the county register of deeds [now recorder]. Farm Credit Bank v. Martinson, 453 N.W.2d 816, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 846, 111 S. Ct. 131, 112 L. Ed. 2d 99, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 4468 (U.S. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where tenant erected the grain bins in controversy on leased property prior to the recordation of bank’s mortgage, and tenant did not file a notice with the county register of deeds [now recorder] which would have given bank, as the holder of a mortgage, any notice of tenant’s intention to remove the bins, tenant failed to preserve his right of removal against the subsequent mortgagee; as a result, there was no reason to include him as a party in foreclosure proceedings on the leased property. Farm Credit Bank v. Martinson, 453 N.W.2d 816, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 846, 111 S. Ct. 131, 112 L. Ed. 2d 99, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 4468 (U.S. 1990).

   Dental cabinets, which were screwed into the wall, plumbed, and wired, were intended by the parties to be trade fixtures sold with the dental practice where the cabinets were separately valued as personal property in the purchase price of the dental practice and listed as depreciable assets of the practice by both the former owner and the lessee. Pfeifle v. Tanabe, 2000 ND 219, 620 N.W.2d 167, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 2000).

   Where a tenancy is cut short on account of acts which work a forfeiture by the tenant of the remainder of the term but not an abandonment of the trade fixtures, such fixtures may be removed within a reasonable time after such termination of the tenancy. Hamilton v. Charlebois, 63 N.D. 504, 248 N.W. 676, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 202</cite> (N.D. 1933).

   Agricultural tenant lost any right to the fixtures and improvements that he left behind when his farm tenancy ended, long before the foreclosure. Because tenant had no possession of, nor an ownership interest in, the land or its improvements, the county court properly ordered him and his claimed goods evicted. Farm Credit Bank v. Martinson, 478 N.W.2d 810, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   The general tests to be applied in determining if an item is a trade fixture are (1) annexation to the realty, either constructive or actual; (2) adaptation or application to the use or purpose to which that part of the realty to which it is connected is appropriated; and (3) intention to make the article a permanent accession to the freehold. Schnaible v. Bismarck, 275 N.W.2d 859, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>

   In general, three factors are examined to determine if an item installed in a building is a trade fixture: (1) The means by which it has been annexed to the real estate; (2) whether it is adapted to and necessary for the purpose for which the premises is devoted; and (3) whether the parties intended that the article become a permanent part of the realty. Preeminent among these factors is the parties’ intent; the other two factors find their primary utility as evidence of that intent. R &amp; D Amusement Corp. v. Christianson, 392 N.W.2d 385, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 382</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   A light plant firmly attached to the floor in the basement of a farm dwelling house, with necessary equipment, and a hay carrier attached to a barn, with necessary equipment, are fixtures. Klocke v. Troske, 57 N.D. 404, 222 N.W. 262, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>

   Whether an item constitutes a trade fixture depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, a trade fixture can generally be defined as personal property annexed to the leased premises by the tenant for the purpose of carrying on the business to which the premises are devoted. R &amp; D Amusement Corp. v. Christianson, 392 N.W.2d 385, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 382</cite> (N.D. 1986).

         Accretion Replacing Land Lost by Erosion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Where land shown as riparian on the original survey is lost by erosion so that nonriparian land becomes riparian, and land is thereafter built by accretion to the land which was originally nonriparian, extending over the former location of the original riparian tract, the owner of the land which was originally nonriparian has title only to the accreted land within the boundary of the formerly nonriparian tract. All other land so accreted, extending over the area of the original riparian tract, becomes the property of the original riparian owner, or his successor in interest. Perry v. Erling, 132 N.W.2d 889, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1965).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court did not err in ruling as a matter of law that plaintiff could not claim title to accretions beyond the fixed boundary line set forth in his deed. Excepting land eroding into the river from the grant of property in defendants' deeds did not amount to a conveyance of accretions located in North Dakota to plaintiff. Norby v. Estate of Kuykendall, 2015 ND 232, 869 N.W.2d 405, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 2015).

       <p>

   The law governing the title to accretions that have formed since the establishment of meander lines and other boundaries of governmental subdivisions by the original United States Government Survey does not require that the division of the accretions between adjacent riparian owners be made by extending the boundary lines of legal subdivisions. Jennings v. Shipp, 115 N.W.2d 12, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1962).
       </p>
       <p>

   The main object to be kept in view in a division of accretions is that the division shall be equitable and proportional so as to give each owner a fair share of the land to be divided and his due portion of the new shore line proportionate to his share of the original shore. Jennings v. Shipp, 115 N.W.2d 12, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1962).

   Accretions may be divided between adjacent riparian owners by agreement as well as by actual survey. Jennings v. Shipp, 115 N.W.2d 12, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1962).

   The owner of land fronting on a lake is entitled to any land properly added to his frontage by accretion, provided the process was gradual and imperceptible, and that his land was not originally separated from the water’s edge by the intervening property of any other person.

        Where island in river had completely eroded away by 1933, land formed by accretions to east bank of river belonged to owners of lots on bank even though accreted land extended over area formerly occupied by island lots; thus owners of bank land lots were entitled to compensation for condemnation of land rather than owners of island lots.

       <p>
        Where islands in river which were part of certain riparian lots were completely washed away over a period of time, and subsequent accretion formed new portions of land on certain riparian lots on the river bank, such new areas were the property of the owners of the riparian properties to which the new land attached itself, and did not belong to the successors in interest of the original grantee of the island property. United States v. 2,134.46 Acres of Land, 257 F. Supp. 723, 1966 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10039 (D.N.D. 1966), aff'd, Peterson v. United States, 384 F.2d 664, 1967 U.S. App. LEXIS 4768 (8th Cir. N.D. 1967).

   This statute contemplates a situation where a stream in high water, whether suddenly by avulsion, or gradually by intermittent action at flood stage, cuts a new or auxiliary channel around a portion of the mainland and leaves such portion intact as an island and as a recognizable segment of the mainland from which it was severed.

   This statute has no application to a case where the stream, moving by gradual and imperceptible degrees, eroded and utterly destroyed the mainland in the area in controversy, leaving no part of it intact and identifiable above the low-water mark.

   Where the property of the owner is damaged by reason of the negligence or wrongful act of another, the owner’s right of action to recover is a property right. Kaiser v. Minneapolis, S. P., S. S. M. Ry., 62 N.W.2d 40, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1953).

   Prima facie a chose in action is worth what appears to be due upon it, and unless the presumption is rebutted by legal evidence, it is conclusive. Anderson v.

   A cause of action for the breach of a covenant of seisin is assignable. Beulah Coal Mining Co. v. Heihn, 46 N.D. 646, 180 N.W. 787, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 1920).

   Money due under a contract for personal service can be assigned notwithstanding the fact that the contract itself is not assignable. Dixon-Reo Co. v. Horton Motor Co., 49 N.D. 304, 191 N.W. 780, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1922).

   A contract for the sale of land, in so far as it expresses the purchaser’s obligation to pay the price, is transferable without the purchaser’s consent. First Sec. Bank v. Hillesland, 62 N.D. 31, 241 N.W. 289, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1932).

   The mere naked right of action for fraud and deceit is not a thing in action arising out of the violation of a right of property or out of an obligation. Grabow v. Bergeth, 59 N.D. 214, 229 N.W. 282, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1930).

       <p>

   Fraud causing a pecuniary loss is not “damage to goods” of the deceased and a cause of action therefor does not survive, and is not assignable. Grabow v. Bergeth, 59 N.D. 214, 229 N.W. 282, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1930).

   A landowner’s claim for damages arising out of the negligent spraying of oats raised on his land is assignable. Burt v. Lake Region Flying Serv., 78 N.D. 928, 54 N.W.2d 339, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1952).

   Where the property of the owner is damaged by reason of the negligence or wrongful act of another, the owner’s right of action to recover damages is a property right and is assignable by the owner.

   The good will of one’s business, although intangible, is adequate as a consideration for the promise of a purchaser and may form the subject matter of a contract of sale, in whole or in part.

   Where the charter of a corporation expires after a long period of prosperity in the conduct of its business, and where for a period of years prior to its termination dividends had been earned and paid greatly in excess of a reasonable rate of interest on the capital invested, the good will has a substantial value, capable of being measured in money.

   Where husband desires to give his personal property to his wife, the execution and delivery of a bill of sale thereof is equivalent to a delivery of the property itself. Lenihan v. Meyer, 111 N.W.2d 696, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 1961).

   Where the owner of real estate executes and delivers a voluntary transfer of such property in the form of a deed, done in good faith and as grantor, such deed transfers all of the title of the grantor therein to his grantee and such voluntary transfer needs no consideration to be sustained. Arhart v. Thompson, 75 N.D. 189, 26 N.W.2d 523, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D. 1947).

   Where an aged, widowed mother executes and delivers to her only son a deed to all her real property, reserving in herself a life estate, and it appears in the evidence in an action to set aside the deed that the mother had a change of mind after the transaction was completed, equity does not require that the deed be set aside for failure of consideration. Young v. Smith, 191 N.W.2d 516, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite>, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 127</cite> (N.D. 1971).

   Although conveyance by deed takes effect upon delivery of the deed by the grantor, it is well settled that “acceptance by the grantee is an essential part of a delivery”. CUNA Mortgage v. Aafedt, 459 N.W.2d 801, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   The recording of a deed may create a rebuttable presumption of its delivery to, and its acceptance by, the grantee, and a failure to renounce a deed after knowledge of its existence may also in some circumstances be sufficient to show that a grantee accepted the deed. However, presumptions of acceptance arise only when the deed is beneficial to the grantee, not when the deed places a burden on the grantee. CUNA Mortgage v. Aafedt, 459 N.W.2d 801, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 1990).

   Where debtor recorded a deed in which he conveyed mortgaged home back to mortgage company in order to avoid foreclosure, mortgage company did not “constructively accept” the deed by failing to object to the deed for four weeks. Debtor had been told that deed would not be accepted, but recorded deed anyway. Nor did delay in objecting raise issues of laches, estoppel, or presumption of acceptance. CUNA Mortgage v.

   Trial court’s finding, in effect, that recording deed to husband and wife from wife’s father in the Register of Deeds [now Recorder] office constituted delivery of the deed sufficient to transfer the title of land described therein was not clearly erroneous. Thus, it was proper for the trial court to consider the land described therein as property within marital estate and subject to distribution in divorce, even though the wife claimed the parties did not own the land because there was no delivery of the deed. Dinius v. Dinius, 448 N.W.2d 210, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        Under North Dakota law, an interest transferred by a deed does not vest until there is delivery of the deed, and absent a delivery of a deed, the deed is of no effect. It is true, however, that the recording of a deed may create a rebuttable presumption of its delivery to, and its acceptance by, the grantee. Doeling v. Berger (In re Berger), 497 B.R. 47, 2013 Bankr. LEXIS 3023 (Bankr. D.N.D. 2013).

   The interest transferred by a deed does not vest until there is a delivery of the deed. Jorgensen v. Crow, 466 N.W.2d 120, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   District court properly quieted title to real property in a grandmother because “delivery” was not statutorily presumed and the grandson failed to establish the deeds at issue were delivered inasmuch as the grandmother's attorney was not acting as the grandson's attorney, the deeds were neither actually nor constructively delivered, the grandmother had dominion or control over the deeds through her attorney, the attorney was not a stranger to the grandmother, and the deeds held by the attorney were not constructively delivered to the grandson. Rice v. Neether, 2016 ND 247, 888 N.W.2d 749, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 237</cite> (N.D. 2016).

   District court erred in entering a judgment quieting title to the disputed royalty interest in defendants because, although defendants testified that they did not intend to convey a royalty interest, they could not otherwise explain how plaintiffs obtained the royalty deed conveying a one-twelfth royalty interest in minerals to plaintiffs; defendants only provided speculative testimony that delivery to plaintiffs might have been accidental; and defendants failed to rebut with clear and convincing evidence the presumption that the royalty deed was delivered to and accepted by plaintiffs. Trulson v. Meiers, 2019 ND 243, 933 N.W.2d 922, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   Where a delivery of a deed is made unconditionally, the fact that the deed was not recorded until after death of the grantor does not affect the title. McGuigan v. Heuer, 66 N.D. 710, 268 N.W. 679, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 1936).

   The delivery of a deed which has been knowingly executed with the intention of transferring title completes the transaction so far as the title is concerned, and vests title in the grantee. NORD v. NORD, 68 N.D. 560, 282 N.W. 507, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>

   The interest transferred to a grantee by a deed does not vest until there is a delivery of the deed by the grantor and acceptance of the deed by the grantee; a deed is of no effect unless it is delivered but, delivery is of no avail unless the grantor effectuates it with the intent that the deed presently pass title to the grantee. In re Estate of Dittus, 497 N.W.2d 415, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 41</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>

   Although the debtors provided extrinsic evidence indicating that a quitclaim deed between them and the lender was not intended to be an actual transfer of ownership, extrinsic evidence could not be considered under the parol evidence rule because the delivered and recorded deed clearly and unambiguously conveyed all of the debtors' right, title, and interest in the property to the lender.

       Delivery must be absolute — Conditional delivery ineffective, becomes absolute.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A grant cannot be delivered to the grantee conditionally. Delivery to the grantee or to the grantee’s agent as such is necessarily absolute and the instrument takes effect thereupon, discharged of any condition on which the delivery was made.

   To make transfer of real property by a deed valid as between the grantor and grantee, it is not necessary that the instrument be acknowledged. Bumann v. Burleigh County, 73 N.D. 655, 18 N.W.2d 10, 1945 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1945).

   Title to mineral rights was transferred to the grantee as of the date of the manual delivery by the grantor and manual acceptance by the grantee of the mineral deeds notwithstanding provisions in the contract for sale providing that grantee was not to issue the consideration for such conveyance until he was satisfied that grantor’s title was acceptable, and that grantee would not claim ownership of the mineral interests until after such consideration (in the form of corporate stock) had been issued to grantor. Adams v. Little Mo. Minerals Ass'n, 143 N.W.2d 659, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1966).

   Clear and convincing evidence must be produced to rebut the presumption of the delivery of a deed to or ownership of an instrument by a grantee in whose possession the deed is retained. Cox v. McLean, 66 N.D. 696, 268 N.W. 686, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 1936).

        Where plaintiffs executed deed and placed it in the hands of agent of defendant for delivery pursuant to an agreement that agent should have the right to demand from his principal as a condition precedent to such delivery, that the principal should procure a deed to the agent for other land, plaintiff’s deed, having been delivered to defendant without the performance of such condition precedent, passed title, as it was incompetent for the agent to make any agreement securing a benefit for himself adverse to his employers’ interests. Holt v. Colton, 22 N.W. 495, 4 Dakota 67, 1885 Dakota LEXIS 4 (Dakota 1885).
       </p>
       <p>

   If the grantor makes a manual delivery to the grantee of a deed absolute in form, intending to part with all authority and dominion over the instrument, the delivery is absolute and title passes immediately in accordance with the terms of the deed, notwithstanding any intention or understanding to the contrary between the parties. Ueland v. More Bros., 22 N.D. 283, 133 N.W. 543, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 1911); Anderson v. Overby, 46 N.D. 631, 180 N.W. 708, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   Where a grantee does not record a deed nor take possession of the land until after the decease of the grantor, and there is evidence that she had in mind a secret purpose to give back the title to the grantor in case he should survive the grantee, the deed nevertheless was absolute in the light of positive testimony to that effect. Cale v. Way, 46 N.D. 558, 179 N.W. 921, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>

   A deed given by a husband to his wife for cancellation of the husband’s debt to her father, and given by the wife to her father for safekeeping, is sufficiently delivered and founded on a good consideration. State Bank v. Newell, 55 N.D. 184, 212 N.W. 848, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1927).
       </p>
       <p>

   It is essential to a valid delivery that there be some act or declaration from which an intention to pass title may be inferred, and this is true although the grantee is of very immature years. Shuck v. Shuck, 77 N.D. 628, 44 N.W.2d 767, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>

   Whether there was a delivery of a deed depends upon the intention of the grantor. McGuigan v. Heuer, 66 N.D. 710, 268 N.W. 679, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 1936).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where the individuals claimed title through a series of quitclaim deeds, the judgment quieting title in the owner was affirmed; this section did not apply in that the delivery of the deed was not conditional. Valley Honey Co., LLC v. Graves, 2003 ND 125, 666 N.W.2d 453, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1165, 124 S. Ct. 1179, 157 L. Ed. 2d 1212, 2004 U.S. LEXIS 900 (U.S. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>

   Although the debtors provided extrinsic evidence indicating that a quitclaim deed between them and the lender was not intended to be an actual transfer of ownership, extrinsic evidence could not be considered under the parol evidence rule because the delivered and recorded deed clearly and unambiguously conveyed all of the debtors' right, title, and interest in the property to the lender.

   Finstad v. Gord, 2014 ND 72, 844 N.W.2d 913, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 2014).

      A grant may be deposited by the grantor with a third person to be delivered on the performance of a condition, and on delivery by the depositary it will take effect. While in the possession of the third person and subject to condition, it is called an escrow.

       <p>

   The placing by the parties thereto of a promissory note in the hands of a third party with instructions not to deliver the same until directed to do so by the maker did not constitute an escrow. Nichols &amp; Shepard Co. v. First Nat'l Bank, 6 N.D. 404, 71 N.W. 135, 1897 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 1897).
       </p>
       <p>

   An escrow of a grant can only be created by delivery to a third person and not by delivery to the grantee. Johnson v. Weldy, 79 N.D. 80, 54 N.W.2d 829, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1952); Kunick v. Trout, 85 N.W.2d 438, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1957).

       <p>

   A valid escrow may be made by oral agreement and its existence may, at least in part, be shown by circumstances and conduct indicating the intention of the parties. Ganser v. Zimmerman, 80 N.W.2d 828, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 1956); Kunick v. Trout, 85 N.W.2d 438, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1957).

   A document placed in escrow is simply left to await the happening of some event or fulfillment of a condition the performance of which rests entirely with the other party and the grantor or maker cannot recall the escrow nor control the document.

   An escrow agreement may apply to mortgages or other instruments deposited upon conditions similar to those prevailing in the escrow of deeds. Ganser v. Zimmerman, 80 N.W.2d 828, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   The death of a grantor while his deed is held in escrow does not invalidate the instrument and it may be subsequently delivered upon compliance by the grantee with the conditions of the escrow agreement or upon the happening of the contingency upon which valid delivery depends. Ganser v. Zimmerman, 80 N.W.2d 828, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   Time is not of the essence of an escrow agreement unless so specified, and if no time is specified performance should be had within a reasonable time unless such time of performance has been waived. Ganser v. Zimmerman, 80 N.W.2d 828, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   Trial court’s finding, in effect, that recording deed to husband and wife from wife’s father in the Register of Deeds [now Recorder] office constituted delivery of the deed sufficient to transfer the title of land described therein was not clearly erroneous. Thus, it was proper for the trial court to consider the land described therein as property within marital estate and subject to distribution in divorce, even though the wife claimed the parties did not own the land because there was no delivery of the deed.

   A deed left among other papers, with a letter showing an intention that the land described should go to the grantee on the death of the grantor, is not a constructive delivery. Black v. Black, 58 N.D. 501, 226 N.W. 485, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1929).

   There was no constructive delivery of the deed where grantor executed the deed without the knowledge of the grantee, retained possession of the deed in his bank box, retained possession of the keys to the bank box, and paid taxes on the land described in the deed until his death. First Nat'l Bank v. Bloom, 264 N.W.2d 208, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 1978).

   If a deed is delivered to a third person to be delivered to the grantee on the death of the grantor, such delivery transfers the title to the grantee, subject to the life interest of the grantor in the land. Arnegaard v. Arnegaard, 7 N.D. 475, 75 N.W. 797, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 1898); Silbernagel v. Silbernagel, 79 N.D. 275, 55 N.W.2d 713, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       </h5>
       <p>

   The question of constructive delivery of deeds to grantee named therein was a question of fact where the deeds were executed by grantee’s mother and left with bank with a statement that the grantor wanted the deeds recorded if anything happened to her. Magoffin v. Watros, 45 N.D. 406, 178 N.W. 134, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>

   Whether or not there was actual or constructive delivery of a deed is a question of fact. Thus, the findings of fact of the district court that there was actual or constructive delivery of a deed will be upheld by the supreme court unless it concludes that these findings are clearly erroneous.

   The destruction of an unrecorded but delivered deed does not divest the title of the grantee and revest it in the grantor. Russell v. Meyer, 7 N.D. 335, 75 N.W. 262, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 1898).

      <p>

   Where a grantor has deposited a deed with a third person to be delivered to the grantee after the death of the grantor, he cannot subsequently, by withdrawing or destroying the deed, affect a delivery thus completed. Silbernagel v. Silbernagel, 79 N.D. 275, 55 N.W.2d 713, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>

   Redelivering a deed of real property to the grantor does not operate to retransfer the legal title, nor is such retransfer effected by the destruction of the redelivered deed by the grantor. Kuntz v. Partridge, 65 N.W.2d 681, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 99</cite> (N.D. 1954).

   Summary judgment was properly entered against appellant in a case alleging trespass and other causes of action because a 1953 permit issued to another constituted an easement, rather than a license, since it was not revocable at the will of a landowner; under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-10s47-10-11" target="_self">47-10-11</a></cite>, a transfer of real property passed all easements, but a license was generally not assignable.

   April 2007 pipeline easement was ambiguous, and the district court erred in construing the easement as a matter of law. However, the district court did not err in ruling that an energy company's use of plaintiff's private road to access a second pipeline on plaintiffs' land was not authorized by a 2008 road use agreement and was a trespass.

   Insertion of the word “Royalty” in a printed deed form suited to the conveyance of a mineral interest created an ambiguity because rational contrary arguments could be made as to the meaning of the language in question.

   District court erred in ruling as a matter of law that a railroad acquired only an easement under five separate deeds where the deeds unambiguously conveyed land, warranted title, and did not use any words limiting the grant, and no other provisions or language created ambiguity.

   District court erred in ruling that the railroad acquired only an easement under a deed with a slightly different property description where the deed conveyed a strip, piece, or parcel of land to the railroad and included warranty and habendum clauses, and no other provisions or language limited the interest conveyed or created ambiguity in the type of interest conveyed.

   District court erred in holding an ambiguity existed in the right-of-way deeds where, rather than granting and conveying a strip, piece, parcel, or tract of land, the deeds explicitly stated that they granted a right of way through the specified land and specifically limited the purposes of the right of way for the laying out, construction, and maintenance of a public drain.

   Court interpreted grants of property in like manner with contracts and, therefore, the same reasoning applied to its interpretation of the lease. The designated acreage in an otherwise unambiguous lease was irrelevant in light of the specific description. Lario Oil &amp; Gas Co. v.

   In deciding ownership of mineral interests, the district court's findings about the existence of a resulting trust were not clearly erroneous. The district court properly considered the facts and circumstances of the case and found the use of the word “trustee” in the grant deed was evidence of an intent to create a trust at the time the property was conveyed.

   Transfer of rental signs from a rental sign business to a sign company did not constitute a gift in light of an ambiguous transfer agreement, as extrinsic evidence tended to establish that the transfer document was not intended to give ownership interest in the signs to the company but to allow the company to use the signs; therefore, the trial court did not err in dismissing the sign company owner’s suit for conversion after the signs and letters were taken by the rental sign business.

   Grantees were not entitled to quiet title to property because the grantor’s interest in the land of the decedent’s estate was still subject to administration and the personal representative’s power over the estate property was superior to any title or interest of the grantees in the estate property, while the grantor had no claim to the land held by a trust as the trustee had sole authority to act on behalf of the trust.

   A grantor who, by warranty deed, purports to convey a fractional mineral interest is estopped from asserting title to a reserved fractional mineral interest in contradiction to the interest purportedly conveyed; the key question is, not what the grantor purported to retain for himself, but what he purported to give to the grantee. If both grant and reservation cannot be given effect, the reservation must fail. Mau v. Schwan, 460 N.W.2d 131, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1990).

     <p>
      An estate in real property, other than an estate at will or for a term not exceeding one year, can be transferred only by operation of law or by an instrument in writing, subscribed by the party disposing of the same or by the party’s agent thereunto authorized by writing. This does not abridge the power of any court to compel the specific performance of any agreement for the sale of real property in case of part performance thereof.

       <p>

   To make a transfer of real property by a deed valid as between the grantor and the grantee, it is not necessary that the instrument be acknowledged. Bumann v. Burleigh County, 73 N.D. 655, 18 N.W.2d 10, 1945 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        As between the parties, the fact that the deed is not acknowledged does not prevent it from operating as a transfer of real estate. Knoshaug v. Pollman, 148 F. Supp. 16, 1957 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3967 (D.N.D.), aff'd, 245 F.2d 271, 1957 U.S. App. LEXIS 4833 (8th Cir. N.D. 1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of grantor to re-sign and re-acknowledge a deed that was altered by the grantee rendered that deed null and void on its face. Neither grantee's proffered justifications for altering an exhibit to the purchase agreement before recording it nor the alteration's purported harmlessness excused his noncompliance with the rules governing grantors. Armstrong v. Berco Res., LLC, 752 F.3d 716, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 9030 (8th Cir. N.D. 2014).

   To make valid a written contract for the sale of real property signed by an agent of the vendor, the agent must have authority in writing from the owner so to do. Brandrup v. Britten, 11 N.D. 376, 92 N.W. 453, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1902).

   The statute of frauds deals with contracts necessarily affecting the title and conveyance of real estate as between the parties to the contract and does not include a contract of agency whereby the agent is to bid in real estate in the name of the principal. Schmidt v. Beiseker, 14 N.D. 587, 105 N.W. 1102, 1905 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 92</cite> (N.D. 1905).

   Rule voiding real estate sale entered into with purchaser by agent who has only verbal authority from owner was applicable even though purported agent was attorney; mere payment of money consideration by buyer generally is not sufficient justification for enforcing oral contract to convey land; acts relied upon as partial performance, to take an oral agreement out of statute of frauds, must be such as to be incomprehensible unless related to the contract; payment of taxes, partial payment of $3,000 mortgage and possession of premises by purchaser were consistent with his operation of land under his seven-eighths ownership of property and were insufficient to take alleged oral contract for sale of remaining one-eighth interest in property out of statute of frauds.

   In an action by husband and wife, owning building and lot as joint tenants, to quiet title to a portion of their lot upon which defendant’s building encroached, where plaintiff husband entered into an oral agreement with the defendant for use of plaintiffs’ wall as a party wall and for an easement to a strip of plaintiffs’ lot, and pursuant to such oral agreement, the plaintiff husband allowed the defendant to construct his building, using such strip, and attach his building to plaintiffs’ building, and defendant spent large sums of money in construction of his building and to pay for repairs to the party wall, there was sufficient partial performance by the defendant to take the oral agreement out of the statute of frauds as between plaintiff husband and defendant.

   In order to be sufficient to relieve an oral agreement for the sale of real estate from the effect of the statute of frauds, the acts relied upon as partial performance must be of such a nature as to be incomprehensible unless viewed in relation to the contract to convey an interest in land.

   Actions of purchaser did not constitute sufficient part performance to remove an oral contract for the sale of real property from the statute of frauds where there was a dispute as to the amount of the property to be sold and the actions were consistent with either disputed amount. Anderson v. Mooney, 279 N.W.2d 423, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 1979).

   The general rule is that contracts for the sale of real property and transfers of real property interests must be made by an instrument in writing. However, part performance of an oral contract which is consistent only with the existence of the alleged contract removes it from the statute of frauds. Williston Coop. Credit Union v.

   Possession of real estate obtained without the acquiescence of a vendor is not such possession as will constitute part performance and thus satisfy the statute of frauds. Brey v. Tvedt, 74 N.D. 192, 21 N.W.2d 49, 1945 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>

   Constructive possession is without force as a factor to take verbal agreement for the sale of real estate out of the statute of frauds. Henry S. Grinde Corp. v. Klindworth, 77 N.D. 597, 44 N.W.2d 417, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite>, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>

   In order to operate as a factor in the part performance of a verbal contract for the sale of real estate so as to take it out of the statute of frauds, improvements must be valuable, substantial, and permanent, and such that an action at law for damages would not afford adequate relief. Henry S. Grinde Corp. v. Klindworth, 77 N.D. 597, 44 N.W.2d 417, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite>, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1950); Syrup v. Pitcher, 73 N.W.2d 140, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>

   An agreement for the conveyance of an interest in real property, within the statute of frauds, may be enforced, although it is not in writing, where the party takes possession and makes improvements on the property. Brandhagen v. Burt, 117 N.W.2d 696, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1962).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where defendants took possession pursuant to an oral contract of sale and made substantial permanent improvements to the property in reliance upon that contract, the statute of frauds did not bar specific enforcement of the oral contract of sale of the property. Green v. Gustafson, 482 N.W.2d 842, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section would not preclude enforcement of an alleged oral sales contract where the lessee invested labor and money in improvements on the premises; the lessor represented that she owned the land and would sell it to the lessee after the lease terminated. Ehrman v. Feist, 1997 ND 180, 568 N.W.2d 747, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1997).

   Where lessee-vendee in possession exercised an option to purchase an undivided one-half interest by tendering the purchase price, the option to purchase became an assignable contract of purchase and the lessee-vendee became the equitable owner of one-half interest and was entitled to share in the possession of the land.

   Because a lessee was capable of closing within a reasonable time, and a decedent’s estate was unwilling to close on property, the lessee’s delay in performance was reasonable, and the district court’s finding that his was capable of closing on the property within a reasonable time from the execution of the agreement to purchase the property was not clearly erroneous; the lessee’s delay in performance was not unreasonable, and there was not a failure of consideration.

   An executory contract to convey the deed with the usual covenants was not satisfied by a deed from vendor’s grantee, since the right to the vendor’s personal covenants not running with the land was a valuable right and the vendee was entitled to insist on receiving them in accordance with contract.

   A grantor who, by warranty deed, purports to convey a fractional mineral interest is estopped from asserting title to a reserved fractional mineral interest in contradiction to the interest purportedly conveyed; the key question is, not what the grantor purported to retain for himself, but what he purported to give to the grantee. If both grant and reservation cannot be given effect, the reservation must fail. Mau v. Schwan, 460 N.W.2d 131, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Perfection of a mortgage on real estate as against subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers is accomplished by recordation.

      A grant made by the owner of an estate for life or years, purporting to transfer a greater estate than the owner could transfer lawfully, does not work a forfeiture of the owner’s estate but passes to the grantee all the estate which the grantor could lawfully transfer.

       Title to highway, street, alley, and public right of way — Vacation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A transfer of land bounded by a highway, street, alley, or public right of way passes the title of the person whose estate is transferred to the soil of the highway, street, alley, or public right of way in front to the center thereof unless a different intent appears from the grant. Every conveyance of real estate, which abuts upon a vacated highway, street, alley, or other public right of way, shall be construed, unless a contrary intent appears, to include that part of such highway, street, alley, or public right of way which attaches either by operation or presumption of law, to such abutting real estate upon such vacation.

      A transfer of real property passes all easements attached thereto and creates in favor thereof an easement to use other real property of the person whose estate is transferred in the same manner and to the same extent as such property obviously and permanently was used by the person whose estate is transferred, for the benefit thereof, at the time when the transfer was agreed upon or completed.

   Summary judgment was properly entered against appellant in a case alleging trespass and other causes of action because a 1953 permit issued to another constituted an easement, rather than a license, since it was not revocable at the will of a landowner; under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-10s47-10-11" target="_self">47-10-11</a></cite>, a transfer of real property passed all easements, but a license was generally not assignable. Moreover, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-05s47-05-02.1" target="_self">47-05-02.1</a></cite>(1) only applied to easements that became binding after July 1, 1977.

       After-acquired title.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a person purports by proper instrument to convey real property in fee simple and subsequently acquires any title or claim of title to the real property, the real property passes by operation of law to the person to whom the property was conveyed or that person’s successor. A quitclaim deed that includes the word “grant” in the words of conveyance, regardless of the words used to describe the interest in the real property being conveyed by the grantor, passes after-acquired title. The use of a quitclaim deed, with or without the inclusion of after-acquired title in the deed, does not create any defect in the title of a person that conveys real property. This section applies to any conveyance regardless of when executed.

   Where grantor owned the property in fee simple at the time he purportedly executed the warranty deed transferring the property to the grantor, the doctrines of after-acquired title and estoppel by deed were not applicable to bar grantor’s claim to the property after the conveyance by adverse possession.

   After-acquired title by the grantor will not, as a general rule, inure to the benefit of the grantee under a quitclaim deed. Bilby v. Wire, 77 N.W.2d 882, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   When the quitclaim deed contains a warranty of title, the warranty estops the warrantor from asserting against the grantee or his assigns any after-acquired title derived through any act or conveyance of the warrantor prior to the deed.

Codified Laws §§ 3249, 3254, the court construed the deed as a quitclaim deed and rejected appellants’

   claim that use of the word “grant” transformed the entire deed so as to also pass after-acquired title under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-10s47-10-15" target="_self">47-10-15</a></cite>.

   Where a person purports by a proper instrument to grant real property in fee simple and subsequently acquires any title or claim of title thereto, the title or claim so acquired passes by operation of law to the grantee.

   Divorce judgment did not convey after-acquired title in mineral interests because the judgment was not a quit claim deed and included no language granting or warranting the grantor's title to the mineral interests in fee simple, so the judgment purported to convey only the grantor's interest as distinguished from a fee simple title.

   Since there is no reasonable basis for requiring that the nature, length, width and thickness of coal reservations be described in a deed when such description is not required of grants of coal, these sections (requiring that reservations be so described in order to be effective) create a classification which is unreasonable and which results in invidious discrimination against an interest in coal created by reservation as opposed to one created by a grant; this constitutes a violation of the equal protection clauses of the state constitution and the United States constitution.

   Since there is no reasonable basis for requiring that the nature, length, width and thickness of coal reservations be described in a deed when such description is not required of grants of coal, these sections (requiring that reservations be so described in order to be effective) create a classification which is unreasonable and which results in invidious discrimination against an interest in coal created by reservation as opposed to one created by a grant; this constitutes a violation of the equal protection clauses of the state constitution and the United States constitution.

      All conveyances of mineral rights or royalties in real property in this state, excluding leases, shall be construed to grant or convey to the grantee thereof all minerals of any nature whatsoever except those minerals specifically excluded by name in the deed, grant, or conveyance, and their compounds and byproducts, but shall not be construed to grant or convey to the grantee any interest in any gravel, clay, or scoria unless specifically included by name in the deed, grant, or conveyance.

      No lease of mineral rights in this state shall be construed as passing any interest to any minerals except those minerals specifically included and set forth by name in the lease. For the purposes of this paragraph the naming of either a specific metalliferous element, or nonmetalliferous element, and if so stated in lease, shall be deemed to include all of its compounds and byproducts, and in the case of oil and gas, all associated hydrocarbons produced in a liquid or gaseous form so named shall be deemed to be included in the mineral named. The use of the words “all other minerals” or similar words of an all-inclusive nature in any lease shall not be construed as leasing any minerals except those minerals specifically named in the lease and their compounds and byproducts.

   Where language in deed did not constitute a reservation so clearly expressed and explicit as to leave no room for doubt, and was ambiguous as to whether the exception was an exception to the grant or to the warranty, the language did not effectively except or reserve to the grantor any mineral interest.

   District court properly granted summary judgment to appellee landowner in her action to quiet title to gravel, clay, and scoria in a section of land because the reservation of minerals in a 1970 warranty deed did not include gravel, clay or scoria under North Dakota law prior to July 1, 1975—before the enactment of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-10s47-10-25" target="_self">47-10-25</a></cite>.

      If the attorney general has reason to believe that any person is violating section 47-10.1-02, the attorney general shall commence an action in the district court in which any agricultural land relative to the violation is situated, or if situated in two or more counties, in the district court for that county in which a substantial part of the land is situated. The attorney general shall file for record with the recorder in each county in which any portion of the land is located a notice of the pendency of the action. If the court finds that the land in question is being held in violation of section 47-10.1-02, it shall enter an order so declaring. The attorney general shall file for record any such order with the recorder of each county in which any portion of the land is located. Thereafter, the person, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company, trustee, or other business entity owning the land has a period of one year from the date of the order to divest itself of the lands. The one-year limitation period is deemed a covenant running with the title to the land against any grantee or assignee. Any land not divested within the time prescribed shall be sold at public sale in the manner prescribed by law for the foreclosure of a real estate mortgage by action. In addition, any prospective or threatened violation may be enjoined by an action brought by the attorney general in the manner provided by law. No title to land shall be invalid or subject to forfeiture by reason of the alienage of any former owner or person having a former interest therein.

   On the sale of personal property mixed with like property, separation of the part sold from the mass was not necessary for title to pass if the parties intended that title pass and the property sold had been identified.

   The title to property would not pass so long as the contract of sale made by an agent in excess of his authority remained executory. Westby v. J. I. Case Threshing Mach. Co., 21 N.D. 575, 132 N.W. 137, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>

   Under an executory agreement where delivery and acceptance, vesting of title and payment were concurrent acts, the title did not vest until delivery and acceptance.

   Hart-Parr Co. v. Finley, 31 N.D. 130, 153 N.W. 137 (1915), explained,

   Orfield v. Harney, 33 N.D. 568, 157 N.W. 124, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> and

   Where pursuant to the terms of an executory contract materials were to be furnished and labor performed, the contract was not divisible as between the material and labor so as to pass title to the materials before the required labor was performed, unless provided in the contract.

   District court did not err in finding a decedent gifted a tractor to a lessee because it chose between two permissible views of the evidence; the district court found the only evidence of the decedent owning the tractor was the fact that he depreciated it on his tax returns, which were not conclusive evidence that a gift was made or was not made.

       <p>

   Where a claim of a gift is not asserted until after the death of the donor, the evidence must be clear and convincing of every element requisite to constitute a gift. In re Estate of Kaspari, 71 N.W.2d 558, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1955).
       </p>

   District court did not err in finding a decedent gifted a tractor to a lessee because it chose between two permissible views of the evidence; the district court found the only evidence of the decedent owning the tractor was the fact that he depreciated it on his tax returns, which were not conclusive evidence that a gift was made or was not made. Hartman v. Grager, 2021 ND 160, 964 N.W.2d 482, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 162</cite> (N.D. 2021).

   To constitute a valid gift of personal property inter vivos, the delivery of the property must clearly appear and the donee must lose all control over the same. Luther v. Hunter, 7 N.D. 544, 75 N.W. 916, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1898).
       </p>
       <p>

   A verbal gift is invalid if it is not accompanied by a transfer of possession or by delivery, actual or symbolical. Ramsdell v. Warner, 48 N.D. 96, 183 N.W. 281, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>

   A completed “gift inter vivos” is a transfer of property made voluntarily and without consideration, effective immediately and irrevocably on unconditional delivery actual or symbolical, having regard to the circumstances and nature of the property. Reel v. Hansboro State Bank, 52 N.D. 182, 201 N.W. 861, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1924); First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Green, 66 N.D. 160, 262 N.W. 596, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>

   To constitute a valid, effective gift inter vivos there must be an intention on the part of the donor to then and there transfer title to the property to the donee, coupled with an actual or constructive delivery of the property of a nature sufficient to divest the donor of all dominion over the property and to invest the donee therewith. Zeman v. Mikolasek, 75 N.D. 41, 25 N.W.2d 272, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1947); In re Estate of Kaspari, 71 N.W.2d 558, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        As this section is a general provision dealing with all oral gifts, while N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-31 contains specific provisions governing joint accounts and disposition of funds remaining on deposit at death, any conflict between this section and N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-31 would be resolved in favor of the latter. 508 N.W.2d 360.

       <p>

   Transfer of rental signs from a rental sign business to a sign company did not constitute an oral gift confirmed by a written agreement in light of ambiguity in the transfer agreement, as extrinsic evidence tended to establish that the transfer document was not intended to give ownership interest in the signs to the company but to allow the company to use the signs; therefore, the trial court did not err in dismissing the sign company owner’s suit for conversion after the signs and letters were taken by the rental sign business.

In any other case, it need not be returned until demanded. The borrower of personal property for use shall return it to the lender at the place contemplated by the parties at the time of the lending, or if no particular place was contemplated by them, at the place where it was at the time of the lending.

         Essential Terms of Oral Agreement.

       </h5>
       <p>

   Essential terms of an oral contract to continue lending money in the future include the amount and duration of the loans, interest rates, and, where appropriate, the methods of repayment and collateral for the loans, if any. Taken alone, the absence of any one of these terms may not be of great significance; however, viewed collectively, their absence is fatal to the existence of a binding contract. Delzer v. United Bank, 459 N.W.2d 752, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>

   Interest rate of the alleged line of credit under oral agreement could have reasonably been inferred from bank’s prevailing lending rate in the farming and ranching sector. Delzer v. United Bank, 459 N.W.2d 752, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>

   For a case discussing the meaning of “loan of money” or “money loaned” within the context of antideficiency statutes, see Borsheim v. Owan, 467 N.W.2d 95, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 48</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a case involving the default of promissory notes, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of an assignee because the notes, which were executed to finance crops, constituted traditional loans of money since they used the terms “principal” and “interest,” rather than “credit extended” and “credit service charge”; therefore, they did not fall under the definition of revolving charge account agreements. AG Acceptance Corp. v. Glinz, 2004 ND 154, 684 N.W.2d 632, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 283</cite> (N.D. 2004).

   In order to constitute a transaction a loan, it is not essential that there be a promissory note or a specified rate of interest or due date. If money passes from one individual to another with the understanding that it is to be repaid, the law will supply the missing details. Hook v. Crary, 142 N.W.2d 140, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

      Interest for any legal indebtedness must be at the rate of six percent per annum unless a different rate not to exceed the rate specified in section 47-14-09 is contracted for in writing. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, all contracts must bear the same rate of interest after maturity as they bear before maturity. A charge for a late payment penalty may be imposed only if the amount of the late charge or the method of calculation of the late charge has been agreed to by the parties in the loan documents that are signed by the borrower.

   Attorney was charging the client “service charges” on her bill before the bill was due in June 1998, when the attorney quit representing the client, which constituted compensation for the use of money, not compensation for damages for the wrongful detention of money, and triggered application of the usury statutes; the attorney charged the client an interest rate higher than that permitted by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-14s47-14-09" target="_self">47-14-09</a></cite> before he completed his representation of her in June 1998, which was the date the court found the parties had agreed the client would pay the attorney for his services.

   It was not error to apply a two percent interest rate to a wife's equalization payment from a husband, rather than the 6.5 percent rate in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-20s28-20-34" target="_blank">28-20-34</a></cite> or the six percent rate in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-14s47-14-05" target="_self">47-14-05</a></cite>, because (1) no party presented evidence as to the proper rate, and (2) the court explained the reasons for setting the rate at two percent, which was within the range of rates argued by the parties.

   Farmer was entitled to maintain class action on allegations that grain elevators were charging usurious interest on advances to farmers where the same accounting procedure for billing interest was applied to all farmers; fact that some farmers may have signed notes while others did not, that there might be individual differences as to dates of advances and repayments and amount of damages and that there was only one party plaintiff and no other persons had sought to intervene did not preclude class action.

   Attorney was charging the client “service charges” on her bill before the bill was due in June 1998, when the attorney quit representing the client, which constituted compensation for the use of money, not compensation for damages for the wrongful detention of money, and triggered application of the usury statutes; the attorney charged the client an interest rate higher than that permitted by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-14s47-14-09" target="_self">47-14-09</a></cite> before he completed his representation of her in June 1998, which was the date the court found the parties had agreed the client would pay the attorney for his services.

   Where the interest rate charged under a promissory note did not exceed the maximum rate allowable, the forfeiture remedy under this section did not apply. Haider v. Montgomery, 423 N.W.2d 494, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   In order to recover the penalty the statute contemplates an actual payment, and interest is not paid, within the meaning of the statute, by the giving of a renewal note or notes. Lindberg v. Burton, 41 N.D. 587, 171 N.W. 616, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 1918).

   Although the client did not make any usurious payments to the attorney, charging a rate greater than allowed by the usury statutes triggered the usury sanctions under the first prong of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-14s47-14-10" target="_self">47-14-10</a></cite>.

   The parties to a usurious contract may purge it of usury by agreement, but a court of law or equity cannot do so after suit is brought and a defense of usury is interposed. Person v. Mattson, 33 N.D. 49, 156 N.W. 780, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1916).

       In a transaction involving more than one lessor, only one lessor is required to make the disclosures, but all lessors are bound by the disclosures. The disclosures must be made before the consumer rental purchase agreement is executed. The disclosures must be made clearly and conspicuously in writing in at least eight-point type and a copy of the disclosures and the consumer rental purchase agreement must be provided to the consumer. If a disclosure becomes inaccurate as a result of any act or occurrence caused by the consumer or by an agreement or consent entered into after delivery of the required disclosures, the resulting inaccuracy is not a violation of this chapter.

   District court did not err in ruling the 2013 agreement between the seller and the tenant was a lease which the landowner could not cancel at will because the landowner acquired the property subject to the rights of the tenants; the agreement stated it was effective until December 31, 2018, and contained provisions for monthly rent; up until the lawsuit, the parties treated the agreement as a lease; and the rent modification did not relieve the landowner of its obligations under the lease or allow it to eject the tenant from the property.

   In a partnership dispute, a reviewing court did not have to address a trial court’s interpretation of agricultural land in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-16s47-16-02" target="_self">47-16-02</a></cite> because, even assuming there was a possessory interest in a bin site, there was evidence to support the finding that a partner was not ejected from the bin site. The testimony showed that a truck was parked across a road to prevent the removal of equipment, but not to prevent the use of the bins.

   A son's two leases with his mother for farmland were valid and enforceable because each was by operation of law limited to the life estate interest of the mother and thus contained a conditional term not necessarily in excess of 10 years.

   District court erred in entering a judgment in favor of an owner following cross-motions for summary judgment because, even if the district court concluded that document at issue was subject to the 10-year statutory restriction of agricultural leases, the document was ambiguous with regard to whether it was an option to purchase, a contract for deed, or a lease, the court had to consider whether the document had a separate, distinct, and enforceable objective of providing the first lessee with a right of first refusal.

   A lease of agricultural land reserving rent or service of any kind which “shall continue so long as any one of the owners is still alive”, although of indefinite duration, is not a lease for a longer period than ten years, and is valid for the life of the surviving lessor or at least ten years from the date of the complete execution thereof if she lives that long. Anderson v. Blixt, 72 N.W.2d 799, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1955).

   In order for the ban on leases of agricultural lands for a term of more than ten years to apply, the property must actually be leased for agricultural purposes, not merely suitable for such purposes; thus the term of a lease of a radio transmission tower site on farmland was not limited by the ten-year provision. Berry-Iverson Co. v. Johnson, 242 N.W.2d 126, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 222</cite> (N.D. 1976).

   Lease of agricultural lands for the purpose of mining sand, gravel, and rock was not subject to the ten-year limitation of this section where, although not specifically stated in the lease, a construction of the entire lease authorized the lessee to use the land for mining purposes only and did not authorize its use for agricultural purposes, and the land was in fact used only for mining purposes by the lessee. Trauger v. Helm Bros., 279 N.W.2d 406, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1979).

   District court properly declared that the tenants complied with a lease relating to grain and farm equipment storage, declared the lease remained in effect, and dismissed the landlord's eviction action because the leased property was not agricultural land where the lease plainly stated that it was not suitable for farming and excluded pasture land, and remained functional—which the family equated with “good condition and repair”—since the lease was executed.

   Language of

   the agreement used the term “in perpetuity” in conjunction

   with other terms, including allowing the sale of the property at any

   time and the ability to opt out, and either the lessor or the lessee

   could terminate the lease within 10 years and both were uncertain

   events, and thus the agreement did not necessarily extend for a period

   longer than 10 years under the statute, and the district court did

   not err in finding the agreement did not violate the statute and was

   not invalid. Anderson v. Lyons, 2014 ND 61, 845 N.W.2d 1, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        The filing requirement applies to any lease that reserves an interest in crops, and not just those leases containing conditions. The title of the original act supports this conclusion. In re Wild, 795 F.2d 666, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 27181 (8th Cir. N.D. 1986).

        The applicability of this section does not turn on the nature of the landlord’s claim of interest, whether it be a mere lien or claim of title as owner. In re Wild, 50 B.R. 410, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6763 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1985).

       <p>

   Failure to file is a waiver of rights by the lessor only against subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers in good faith of the lessee. The statute does not make a reservation of title void. KERN v. KELNER, 75 N.D. 292, 27 N.W.2d 567, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        The reservation of interests in crops is ineffective against subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers unless the lessor files the lease with the register of deeds [now recorder]. In re Wild, 795 F.2d 666, 1986 U.S. App. LEXIS 27181 (8th Cir. N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the lessor intends to reserve a title interest, that interest may be preserved as against the lessee by merely entering into an agreement for the same. If, however, such reservations are to be effective as against subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers of the lessee, then the lease providing for an exception to the general law of N.D.C.C. §
        47-16-04 must be filed with the register of deeds [now recorder]. Failure to file a lease as required constitutes a waiver by the lessor of all rights reserved by him in the crops. Even a reservation of a title interest may be lost in this fashion. In re Wild, 50 B.R. 410, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 6763 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        The purpose of requiring a lessor to file a lease if he wishes to preserve his claim of interest or reserve title in crops grown on a leasehold is to protect third parties who otherwise would have no knowledge of what the arrangement might be between the lessor and lessee and would assume that all crops grown belonged to the lessee and were thus available to satisfy their liens.

   Where lessor placed lessee in possession of the premises as a tenant, while the parties negotiated the final terms of a contemplated long-term lease, and lessee partially performed its duties, even if the trial court determined that the parties did not agree to a long-term lease, lessee had a one-year lease under this section, absent further evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of a one-year lease.

     <p>
      If a lessee of real property remains in possession of the real property after the expiration of the lease and the lessor accepts rent from the lessee, the parties are presumed to have renewed the lease on the same terms and for the same time, not exceeding one year. Except in the case of a lease with an automatic renewal clause, if a lessee of real property for residential purposes remains in possession of the property after the expiration of the lease and the lessor accepts rent from the lessee, the parties are presumed to have renewed the lease as a month-to-month tenancy.

   The acceptance of rent operates as evidence that the landlord consents to the renewal or extension of the contract, and, where the evidence is adequate to establish such consent without a receipt of rent, the receipt or failure to receive the rent is not material.

   A change in a written contract of lease relating to the furnishing of seed and crop division did not alter the nature or break the continuity of a holding so as to terminate a year to year hold-over tenancy.

   If the lessee remains in possession after the expiration of the hiring and the lessor accepts rent from him, the parties are presumed to have renewed the hirings on the same terms and for the same time, not exceeding one year, and the rights of the parties are governed by the provisions of the contract which had expired.

   The presumption raised by this section is disputable and where it appeared that the lessor and the lessee were dissatisfied with the conditions of the lease and for some time had been conducting negotiations for a new lease, the evidence disputed the presumption of extension or renewal.

   Court did not err in holding that the leases terminated on December 31, 2011 and in dismissing the lessee's counterclaims because there was no automatic renewal, the lessors' letter sent to the lessee was effective to exercise the lessors' right to terminate the leases for any cause at the end of the one-year term, the lessee failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact about corporate ratification, and the lessee's counterclaim was time-barred as a matter of law.

     <p>
      A landlord may require reliable supporting documentation be provided by a tenant of a rental dwelling that is subject to a no pets policy, if the tenant asserts a disability requiring a service animal or assistance animal be allowed as an accommodation on the rented premises under any provision of law. Reliable supporting documentation may be provided by a physician or medical professional who does not operate in this state solely to provide certification for service or assistance animals. Reliable supporting documentation must confirm the tenant’s disability and the relationship between the tenant’s disability and the need for the requested accommodation. A landlord may not require supporting documentation from a tenant if the tenant’s disability or disability-related need for a service animal or assistance animal is readily apparent or already known to the landlord.

   A landlord is not answerable in damages to a tenant for eviction from leased property unless the eviction be due to some wrongful act on the part of the landlord, either personally or by some person acting under his authority, or by or through such person, or because of some paramount title. Smith v. Nortz Lumber Co., 72 N.D. 353, 7 N.W.2d 435, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1943).

   Where one joint tenant leased her own interest in the common property to another without the consent of the other joint tenant, the lessees succeeded to the rights of the lessor, and were entitled to enjoy the possession of the property with the other joint tenant as a joint tenant with an undivided one-half interest in the property.

   This section requires a lessee to give the lessor notice before vacating the premises. Hofmann v. Stoller, 320 N.W.2d 786, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 309</cite> (N.D. 1982).

   Where lessee provided lessor with written notice of his intent to terminate the lease and vacate the premises two months prior to vacating and also made several verbal complaints regarding the property in person and by telephone, this was sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that the lessor received notice under this section.

   In response to landlord’s claim for rent due, tenant asserted its right to either abate by virtue of deprivation of use of fire-damaged elevator unrepaired by landlord, or to deduct for the cost of repairs made by tenant following landlord’s failure to repair within a reasonable time pursuant to two lease clauses and this section.

   Commercial landlord’s failure to repair leaking roof and malfunctioning air conditioning unit in a store after repeated demands from the tenant left the premises unfit for occupancy for the purposes for which they were intended and constituted a constructive eviction justifying the tenant’s vacating the premises.

   That business for which the premises had been leased had been terminated, that lessee’s fixtures had all been sold to other parties, that on the date he left the keys to the premises in the cash register drawer, the lessee had no other property in the store, and that lessee had no further use for the premises, all persuasively indicate that lessee intended to surrender the leased premises.

       <p>

   When the tenants had fully performed their obligations and accepted the benefits under an unsigned written termination agreement, their actions were equally consistent with voluntary surrender of the leased premises and with mitigating their damages for the landlord’s alleged breach of the lease, and summary judgment for the landlord was improper.

   Commercial landlord’s failure to repair leaking roof and malfunctioning air conditioning unit in a store after repeated demands from the tenant left the premises unfit for occupancy for the purposes for which they were intended and constituted a constructive eviction justifying the tenant’s vacating the premises.

   Where lessee provided lessor with written notice of his intent to terminate the lease and vacate the premises two months prior to vacating and also made several verbal complaints regarding the property in person and by telephone, this was sufficient evidence to support the trial court’s finding that the lessor received notice under this section.

      Only a lease of real property which is terminable at the pleasure of one of the parties to the contract is terminated by the notice to one party of the death or incapacity of the other party to contract. Upon the death of a lessee of real property for residential purposes, however, and at the option of any surviving lessee or of the estate of the decedent, the lease terminates on the last day of the month in the month following the death of the lessee unless the lease term expires before that time.

   Where a tenant surrendered possession of land to the landlord and then reentered under color of title from a different source, his possession was not as tenant of the record owner and he owed no duty to the record owner to inform him of proceedings to forfeit the record owner’s title to the land.

      One who rents part of a room for a dwelling is entitled to the whole of the room, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary. If a landlord rents a room as a dwelling for more than one family, the person to whom the landlord first rents any part of it is entitled to the possession of the whole room for the term agreed upon. Every tenant in the building under the same landlord is relieved from all obligation to pay rent to the landlord while such double letting of any room continues.

     <p>
      Property with a total estimated value of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars which is left on the premises of a leased dwelling may be retained by the lessor and disposed of without legal process twenty-eight or more days after the lessor received actual notice that the lessee has vacated the premises or twenty-eight or more days after it reasonably appears to the lessor that the lessee has vacated the premises. The lessor is entitled to the proceeds from the sale of the property. The lessor may recover, from the lessee’s security deposit, any storage and moving expenses in excess of the proceeds from the sale incurred in disposing of the property. If the lessor removes the abandoned property from the dwelling unit after a judgment of eviction has been obtained and the special execution has been served, the lessor has a lien upon the property for the reasonable amount of any storage and moving expenses and may retain possession of the property until the charges have been paid. The lien does not have priority over a prior perfected security interest in the property.

   District court erred in granting a mover and a landlord summary judgment in tenants' conviction action and in allowing them the right to dispose of the tenants' property because the landlord failed to meet the requirements imposed by the statute by not serving a special execution and by disposing of property valued in excess of $ 1,500 without legal process; a special execution was required but the landlord admitted that no special execution was obtained or served on the tenants.

     <p>
      When any oil, gas, or other mineral lease given on real property situated in any county of North Dakota and recorded therein terminates or is forfeited it is the duty of the lessee, the lessee’s successors or assigns, within fifteen days after the date of the termination or forfeiture of any lease, to have the lease surrendered in writing, the surrender to be signed by the party making the same, acknowledged, and placed on record in the county where the leased real property is situated without cost to the owner thereof. If the lessee, the lessee’s successors or assigns, fails or neglects to execute and record the surrender within the time provided for, then the owner of the real property may serve upon the lessee, the lessee’s successors or assigns of record, in person or by registered or certified mail, at the lessee’s last-known address, or if the post-office address is not shown of record then by publication once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the real property is situated, a notice in writing in substantially the following form:
     </p>
     <p>
      To : I, the undersigned, owner of the following described land situated in County, North Dakota: (description of land) upon which a lease dated , , was given to notify you that the lease has terminated or become forfeited by breach of the terms thereof, that I elect to declare and do declare the lease forfeited and void and that, unless you do, within twenty days from this date, notify the recorder of the county as provided by law that the lease has not been forfeited, I will file with the recorder a satisfaction of lease as provided by law, and I demand that you execute or have executed a proper surrender of the lease and that you put the same of record in the office of the recorder of the county within twenty days from this date. Dated , .

     </p>
     <p>
      The owner of the real property may after twenty days from the date of service, registration, or first publication of the notice, file with the recorder of the county where the real property is situated a satisfaction of lease setting forth that the affiant is the owner of the real property, that the lease has terminated or that the lessee, or the lessee’s successors or assigns, has failed or neglected to comply with the terms of the lease, reciting the facts constituting the failure and that the same has been forfeited and is void, and setting out in satisfaction of lease a copy of the notice served, as above provided and the manner and time of the service thereof. If the lessee, the lessee’s successors or assigns, gives notice in writing within twenty days after service to the recorder of the county where the real property is located that the lease has not been forfeited and that the lessee, the lessee’s successors or assigns, still claim that the lease is in full force and effect, then the satisfaction of lease may not be recorded but the recorders shall notify the owner of the real property of the action of the lessee, the lessee’s successors or assigns, and the owner of the real property is entitled to the remedies now provided by law for the cancellation of the disputed lease. If the lessee, the lessee’s successors or assigns, fails to notify the recorder, as above provided, then the recorder shall record the satisfaction of lease and thereafter the record of the lease is not notice to the public of the existence of the lease or of any interest therein, or rights thereunder, and the record may not be received in evidence in any court of the state on behalf of the lessee, the lessee’s successors or assigns, against the lessor, the lessor’s successors or assigns.

   The fact that lessee may have less time to respond when lessor’s notice is sent by mail, since his time to respond is computed from the mailing date and not from the date of receipt, than when given by personal service or publication does not result in a denial of due process where lessee has a reasonable time left to respond after receiving the mailed notice; time to respond was reasonable where after receiving the mailed notice lessee still had eighteen days in which to act.

   District court, which declared an oil and gas lease terminated, did not err in concluding a lessee failed to timely pay or tender the required sum under the parties’

   agreement. Although the parties’

   supplemental agreement allowed the lessee to tender the sum by check or draft mailed or delivered to the lessor by the termination date, the check or draft had to be immediately payable and funded on that date, not delayed until some future date, to satisfy the agreement’s requirement that the sum be tendered by the termination date.

       The obligation arising under an oil and gas lease to pay oil or gas royalties to the mineral owner or the mineral owner’s assignee, to deliver oil or gas to a purchaser to the credit of the mineral owner or the mineral owner’s assignee, or to pay the market value thereof is of the essence in the lease contract, and breach of the obligation may constitute grounds for the cancellation of the lease in cases in which it is determined by the court that the equities of the case require cancellation. If the operator under an oil and gas lease fails to pay oil or gas royalties to the mineral owner or the mineral owner’s assignee within one hundred fifty days after oil or gas produced under the lease is marketed and cancellation of the lease is not sought or if the operator fails to pay oil or gas royalties to an unleased mineral interest owner within one hundred fifty days after oil or gas production is marketed from the unleased mineral interest owner’s mineral interest, the operator thereafter shall pay interest on the unpaid royalties, without the requirement that the mineral owner or the mineral owner’s assignee request the payment of interest, at the rate of eighteen percent per annum until paid. If the aggregate amount is less than fifty dollars, the operator may remit semiannually to a person entitled to royalties the aggregate of six months’ monthly royalties. The district court for the county in which the oil or gas well is located has jurisdiction over any proceeding brought under this section. The prevailing party in any proceeding brought under this section is entitled to recover court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees. This section does not apply if mineral owners or their assignees elect to take their proportionate share of production in kind, in the event of a dispute of title existing that would affect distribution of royalty payments, or if a mineral owner cannot be located after reasonable inquiry by the operator; however, the operator shall make royalty payments to those mineral owners whose title and ownership interest is not in dispute.

        This section was enacted as a means of increasing the bargaining power of landowners in their dealings with major oil companies concerning rights under oil and gas leases.

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-16s47-16-39.1" target="_self">47-16-39.1</a></cite> suggested that the possibility of future royalties was, or at least might be in a given case, an important component of the oil and gas lease; the relative importance of the royalty clause to the landowners could not be ascertained from the written document.

   Ir. Oil &amp; Gas, Inc. v. Riemer, 2011 ND 22, 794 N.W.2d 715, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 2011).

       <p>

   District court erred in granting summary judgment to an oil and gas company in the trustees' action for an accounting and all unpaid revenue because the court did not determine the validity of the trust's claim in the 1/8% royalty interest in the property and concluded that the company was not the proper party; however if the trust had a valid interest in the property, the company was a proper party from which to recover the underpayment, the company could not rely solely on its division order, to which the trust was not a party, to protect itself from liability without first proving its accuracy, and a determination of the “dispute of title exception” was contingent upon a finding as to the accuracy of the company's division order.

   District court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to declare a cancellation of an oil and gas lease for lessee’s failure to make royalty payments where there was a legitimate dispute between the lessee and lessor as to amount of royalty payments, and subsequent to filing of action by lessor for such payments, lessor accepted royalty payments upon terms of lessee subject to lessor’s claim for additional payments based upon his calculation of the amount of royalty payments.

        This section represents a judgment by the North Dakota legislature that traditional damage remedies are simply inadequate to protect mineral owners’ royalty interests. The legislature has supplanted common law equity with its own weighing of equitable principles and has determined that the nonpayment of royalties may be grounds for cancellation of a mineral lease. Imperial Oil of North Dakota, Inc. v. Consolidated Crude Oil Co., 851 F.2d 206, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8954 (8th Cir. N.D. 1988).

        The North Dakota legislature intended to make cancellation available as a remedy for the nonpayment of royalties in appropriate cases even where a damages remedy might be adequate. Imperial Oil of North Dakota, Inc. v. Consolidated Crude Oil Co., 851 F.2d 206, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8954 (8th Cir. N.D. 1988).

       <p>
        District court did not err in holding an assignee liable for the pre-bankruptcy confirmation royalties owed to the mineral owners because they did not receive notice of the owner’s bankruptcy proceedings, and the assignee was the entity formed under the reorganization plan and received assignment of the owner’s interest under the relevant oil and gas leases
        .
       </p>
       <p>

   Finding that defendant was liable for suspending royalty payments was improper because that action was justified since there was a dispute of title existing that would affect distribution of royalty payments. Because the trust defendants were mineral owners whose title and ownership interest was in dispute, the statute, by its plain language, did not apply. 2022 ND 8, 2022 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Where over a period of several years, defendant simply refused to make royalty payments to plaintiff and the failure to pay was intentional cancellation was the appropriate remedy. Imperial Oil of North Dakota, Inc. v. Consolidated Crude Oil Co., 851 F.2d 206, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 8954 (8th Cir. N.D. 1988).

       <p>

   District court did not err in awarding the mineral owners simple interest, rather than compound interest, because, while the mineral owners were the prevailing parties in their action for royalty payments, the plain language of the statute did not specifically require an award of interest to be compounded.

      A division order is an instrument executed by the operator, the royalty owners, and any other person having an interest in the production directing the purchaser of oil or gas to pay for the products taken in the proportions set out in the instrument. Royalty payments may not be withheld because an interest owner has not executed a division order. A division order may not alter or amend the terms of the oil and gas lease. A division order that varies the terms of the oil and gas lease is invalid to the extent of the variance and the terms of the oil and gas lease take precedence.

   In a dispute over an oil and gas lease, it was error for a trial court to grant summary judgment upon concluding, as a matter of law, that an individual was not a bona fide purchaser, due to having constructive notice of another’s claim when recording the lease, because (1) whether the individual had notice was a question of fact, (2) deciding an issue on summary judgment was not appropriate if the court had to draw inferences or make findings on disputed facts, (3) although two corporations argued the facts were not disputed, the corporations did not agree on the inferences that could be drawn from the evidence, (4) more than one inference could reasonably be drawn from the evidence and findings of fact were required, which was not appropriate in a summary judgment proceeding, (5) whether the individual acquired property rights in good faith and for value required findings of fact about the events surrounding a transaction, and (6) a factual dispute existed about whether the individual had constructive notice when the individual acquired rights under the lease.

   Where plaintiff had farmed land under an oral lease, on a half-share basis renewed annually, since 1957, but lived during the crop year on adjacent land owned by him and spent the winters in Fargo, he was not a tenant at will within the meaning of this section, and was not entitled to notice of the landlord’s intent to terminate the landlord-tenant relationship at the end of the lease term. Peterson v. McCarney, 254 N.W.2d 438, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 1977).

        This statute, although it requires a notice to quit, does not change the character of a tenancy at will. Spiritwood Grain Co. v. Northern P. R. Co., 179 F.2d 338, 1950 U.S. App. LEXIS 2218 (8th Cir. N.D. 1950).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The homestead of any individual, whether married or unmarried, residing in this state consists of the land upon which the claimant resides, and the dwelling house on that land in which the homestead claimant resides, with all its appurtenances, and all other improvements on the land, the total not to exceed one hundred thousand dollars in value, over and above liens or encumbrances or both. The homestead shall be exempt from judgment lien and from execution or forced sale, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. The homestead may not embrace different lots or tracts of land unless the lots or tracts of land are contiguous. For purposes of this section, “contiguous” means two or more tracts of real property which share a common point or which would share a common point but for an intervening road or right of way.

   The absence of a married woman from her home for three years, while the husband remains in constant occupancy of the land, does not constitute abandonment by the wife of her homestead rights. Rosholt v. Mehus, 3 N.D. 513, 57 N.W. 783, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 1894).
       </p>
       <p>

   A removal from the homestead, with the intention to abandon the same as a homestead, defeats the homestead exemption after creditors’ rights have intervened. Smith v. Spafford, 16 N.D. 208, 112 N.W. 965, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1907).
       </p>
       <p>

   A portion of a homestead may be abandoned and lose its exemption while the remainder of the homestead continues to have the protection of the exemption; such abandonment is a question of fact, and does not arise as a matter of law from the platting of a portion of the homestead land pursuant to a plan to sell. Falconer v. Farmers Union Oil Co., 260 N.W.2d 1, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The dominant element in abandonment of a homestead is intent. In re Lippert, 113 B.R. 576, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 867 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Closely akin to the issue of homestead abandonment is the issue of abandonment of a legal residency. Here too, the law looks to action coupled with intent with intent being the principal focus. As codified by N.D.C.C. §
        54-01-26, a residence cannot be changed until another is gained and can be changed only by the union of act and intent. In re Lippert, 113 B.R. 576, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 867 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is unreasonable and contrary to well-defined standards to assume a person has abandoned the homestead in advance of acquiring a new one. In re Lippert, 113 B.R. 576, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 867 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankruptcy court found that the debtor’s homestead exemption was valid and rejected the creditor’s assertion that the debtor abandoned the property; the creditor failed to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that the debtor’s move from the homestead was with an intent to discontinue her use of the property as a home. In re Murphy, 292 B.R. 403, 2003 Bankr. LEXIS 636 (Bankr. D.N.D. 2003).

   Before a homestead right attaches to land there must be actual or constructive residence on the land with a view to making it a home. Brokken v. Baumann, 10 N.D. 453, 88 N.W. 84, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1901).

   Mere intention to occupy land as a homestead is not sufficient in the absence of acts indicative of carrying such intention into immediate execution to some extent. Brokken v. Baumann, 10 N.D. 453, 88 N.W. 84, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1901).

        Where bankrupt intended to occupy homestead land after marriage and had placed furniture thereon prior to marriage, his failure to occupy such land after marriage and before adjudication as a bankrupt did not defeat his homestead rights therein because his inability to occupy the homestead was due to his confinement in a hospital.

   This section requires that a family reside upon the tract of land claimed as a homestead in a family residence so that acts sustain the intent asserted by the claimant. Tromsdahl v. Nass, 27 N.D. 441, 146 N.W. 719, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 54</cite> (N.D. 1914).

   The exemption which is declared in favor of the head of the family is in a representative capacity, and is intended not for the benefit of the individual, but for the protection and preservation of the home and the benefit of the family; the exemption is not presumed to be waived by failure expressly to claim it. Dieter v. Fraine, 20 N.D. 484, 128 N.W. 684, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1910); Healy v. Bismarck Bank, 30 N.D. 628, 153 N.W. 392, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        It seems clear from this section and the case law that a debtor in North Dakota is entitled to claim a homestead in any land upon which he resides including any structures erected thereon regardless of use or occupancy, so long as the amount claimed does not exceed $80,000.00 over and above liens and encumbrances and so long as the land, if comprised of different tracts, is contiguous.

   Homestead may be divided when the value of the homestead exceeds the homestead exemption amount of $100,000.00 and no material injury would result from the division; therefore, a district court did not abuse its discretion by dividing a marital homestead and awarding a surviving spouse a second floor residence as the homestead. However, the surviving spouse was improperly ordered to pay rent to live in the marital home; the decision to divide the marital home so as to ensure the value of the homestead granted to the surviving spouse remained within the homestead exemption amount was inconsistent with the purposes of the homestead provisions or case law.

   The cause of action of a husband’s judgment creditor, to avoid the husband’s transfer of a homestead to the wife, depends upon the value of the land in excess of the exemption, and is limited to such excess as nonexempt property. Farmers' State Bank v. Weisenhaus, 50 N.D. 949, 198 N.W. 673, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 1924).

   In an action by grantor’s creditor to set aside a deed as a fraudulent conveyance, the grantee in the deed, joined as defendant, could show under a general denial that the property was grantor’s homestead.

   The mortgaging and forced sale of a homestead is not unconstitutional. This section does not violate section 22 of Article XI of the North Dakota Constitution.State ex rel. Board of Univ. &amp; Sch. Lands v. Bladow, 462 N.W.2d 453, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1990).

   Section 22 of Article XI of the North Dakota Constitution does not forbid foreclosure sale of a mortgaged homestead. Farm Credit Bank v. Stedman, 449 N.W.2d 562, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 250</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       <p>

   The homestead and the proceeds thereof are absolutely exempt from seizure by a creditor except as otherwise provided by statute; since exemption was absolute, failure of husband, as head of family, to claim exemption did not waive it. Dieter v. Fraine, 20 N.D. 484, 128 N.W. 684, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1910).

        A judgment entered at a time when property was occupied as a homestead does not become a lien against the property until and unless the excepting provision of this section is complied with. In re Peterson, 80 B.R. 167, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1879 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1987).

   Where a wife joined in a mortgage with the understanding that it was to be used for a specific purpose, but the purpose failed and rights of third parties were not prejudiced, she was entitled to have the mortgage canceled as a lien upon the homestead. Kittel v. Straus, 47 N.D. 88, 181 N.W. 628, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 1920).

       <p>

   The mortgage of a homestead to secure the payment of the purchase price executed by the fee owner need not be signed by the spouse. Roby v. Bismarck Nat'l Bank, 4 N.D. 156, 59 N.W. 719, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 1894).
       </p>
       <p>

   A loan made to one who purchases a relinquishment from an entryman to complete the purchase and to establish a home upon the premises is a debt “created for the purchase price”, and a mortgage to secure the loan is valid although the wife does not join. First Nat'l Bank v. Zook, 50 N.D. 423, 196 N.W. 507, 1923 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1923).

   A property owner lost all right, title, and interest in a fifty-acre tract when her failure to redeem the property prior to the expiration of the redemption extinguished any homestead rights she may have had in the fifty-acre tract. Lake Region Credit Union v. Crystal Pure Water, 502 N.W.2d 524, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1993).

       <p>

   Mortgaging and forced sale of a homestead is constitutional. Podoll v. Brady, 423 N.W.2d 151, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   N.D. Const. Art. XI, § 22 , does not preclude mortgaging and forced sale of one’s homestead. Federal Land Bank v. Gefroh, 418 N.W.2d 602, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where land had been heavily mortgaged, so it was doubtful whether a homestead exemption could have been successfully asserted, and the debtors did not make a claim of homestead in the bankruptcy court until after the liquidation sale was final, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a postponement of the eviction. First Nat'l Bank v. Yagow, 415 N.W.2d 806, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 439</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   The forced sale of a homestead for a mortgage debt, in accordance with this section does not violate N.D. Const. Art. XI, § 22. Lake Region Credit Union v. Crystal Pure Water, 502 N.W.2d 524, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1993).

   Judgment lien attaching to real estate later occupied by the judgment debtor as a homestead is not divested by subsequently acquired homestead rights. First State Bank v. Fischer, 67 N.D. 400, 272 N.W. 752, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 92</cite> (N.D. 1937).

        Unless a judgment creditor, seeking to impress homestead property with the judgment, proceeds prior to conveyance, to seek appraisement and sale consistent with this section, a conveyance to a bona fide purchaser of the homestead property operates to forever foreclose the judgment from becoming a lien on the excess value. In re Peterson, 80 B.R. 167, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1879 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1987).

   Where a husband and wife entered into a verbal agreement to sell a part of a homestead, and accepted a part of the purchase price, and the purchaser went into possession and made improvements with the knowledge and acquiescence of the husband and wife, the purchaser became the equitable owner of the premises.

        Bankruptcy court’s decision to void a mortgage agreement executed between the bank and the partnership was reversed because the partner/debtors did not have authority to transfer the partnership’s property into ownership by the debtors and their spouses; the spouses thus did not have a homestead interest in the properties, and the fact that the spouses did not acknowledge the encumbrance was not relevant.

   Homestead may be divided when the value of the homestead exceeds the homestead exemption amount of $100,000.00 and no material injury would result from the division; therefore, a district court did not abuse its discretion by dividing a marital homestead and awarding a surviving spouse a second floor residence as the homestead. However, the surviving spouse was improperly ordered to pay rent to live in the marital home; the decision to divide the marital home so as to ensure the value of the homestead granted to the surviving spouse remained within the homestead exemption amount was inconsistent with the purposes of the homestead provisions or case law.

      If from the appraisers’ report it appears to the court that the real property claimed as a homestead exceeds in value the amount of the homestead exemption and that it cannot be divided without material injury, the court must make an order directing its sale under the execution. At such sale no bid must be received unless it exceeds the amount of the homestead exemption.

        Debtors did not abandon their home that was located in Bismarck, North Dakota (Bismarck home) simply by relocating to Medora, North Dakota, where the relocation was temporary and necessary for the debtors to manage their business which was located in that city, and in addition, it was reasonable for the debtors to have purchased a mobile home in Medora because they were away for an extended period of time while tending to their business and needed a temporary or second dwelling. Accordingly, the debtors could claim as exempt under N.D.C.C. § 47-18-16 the proceeds from the sale of the Bismarck home.

   Where homestead status once has been established and property has been occupied as homestead by husband and wife, homestead rights continue to exist in favor of husband after death of wife unless homestead has been voluntarily abandoned.

Globe Int’l Protective Bureau, 56 N.D. 613, 218 N.W. 864 (1928), Nelson v. Griggs County, 56 N.D. 729, 219 N.W. 225, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1928) and Conlon v.

   The failure to file a declaration of homestead did not affect the homestead right of claimants, and landowners were entitled to damages for injury to their entire farm in which they were entitled to a homestead of one hundred sixty acres.

   The right to claim premises as a homestead comes into existence by operation of law contemporaneously with the occupancy and use of the premises as a home, and the failure to file a declaration does not generally waive that right.

     <p>
      In order to select a homestead the claimant shall execute and acknowledge, in the same manner as a grant of real property is acknowledged, a declaration of homestead, and file the declaration for record.
     </p>
     <p>
      A claim of a homestead by a debtor who received a discharge is a declaration of homestead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Filing for record in the recorder’s office of the county where the homestead is located a certified copy with the legal description of the discharge constitutes notice that the property is a homestead and exempt from judgments.

   A deed which fails to contain the post-office address of the grantee and is thus ineligible for recording is nevertheless effective as a grant. Glascoe v. Bracksieck, 85 N.W.2d 423, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1957).

      In all cases of joint tenancy in lands, and in all cases where an estate, title, or interest in, or lien upon, lands has been or may be created, which estate, title, interest, or lien was or is to continue only during the life of any person named or described in the instrument by which the estate, title, interest, or lien was created, a copy of the death certificate of the joint tenant or of the person upon whose life the estate, title, interest, or lien was or is limited, duly certified by any officer who is required by the laws of the state or country in which the record is made, to keep a record of the death of persons occurring within the jurisdiction of the officer, may be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county in which the lands are situated. The legal description of any property to which the recording of the death certificate relates must be attached to the death certificate. The certified copy of death certificate, or the record thereof in the office, or a duly certified copy of the last mentioned record, is prima facie evidence of the death of the person and the termination of the joint tenancy and all the estate, title, interest, and lien as was or is limited upon the life of that person.

         Constructive Notice.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   By statute the recording of deeds and mortgages and instruments affecting title to real property is constructive notice to all purchasers and encumbrancers subsequent to the recording. It is not a notice to a prior purchaser. First Nat'l Bank v. Big Bend Land Co., 38 N.D. 33, 164 N.W. 322, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 1917).
       </p>
       <p>

   Instrument that is erroneously indexed under wrong description in tract index does not give constructive notice; prospective purchaser or encumbrancer has no duty, insofar as constructive notice is concerned, to consult reception book or grantor-grantee indexes other than to determine if there are unrecorded and unindexed instruments in hands of register of deeds [now recorder]; consequence of failure to correctly index a mortgage in tract index falls upon mortgagee rather than subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer. Hanson v. Zoller, 187 N.W.2d 47, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person dealing with real property is charged with notice of properly recorded instruments affecting the title to property. In re Fluge, 57 B.R. 451, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 4869 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where lessees’ failure to ascertain the true state of the title to property was the basis for their alleged mistake of fact, that mistake could not void the lease agreement, because they could have determined the true state of the title to the land in question before entering into the lease by checking the office of the register of deeds [now recorder].

       <p>

   Court did not err in finding the planned unit development (PUD) had authority to impose assessments against the owner’s property, because the owner’s warranty deed plainly stated in its legal description that her property was within the PUD, and the amended declaration for the PUD was recorded and the owner was charged with constructive notice of its contents, including provisions imposing covenants running with her property; the owner’s obligations to the PUD were imposed by the covenants running with the land and she was bound by the amended declaration’s relevant provisions by the purchase of her property within the development.

   In an action seeking to quiet title in mineral interests, summary judgment was inappropriate because there were disputed issues of material fact about whether the buyers were good-faith purchasers for value without notice of a prior unrecorded deed. A deed that was executed in 1990, but not recorded until 2012, was valid between the parties to the instrument and those with notice, a statement of claim imposed a duty of further inquiry to ascertain the state of the ownership of the disputed mineral interests, and a buyer was deemed to have constructive notice of the facts an inquiry would have revealed. Desert Partners IV, L.P. v. Benson, 2016 ND 37, 875 N.W.2d 510, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 34</cite> (N.D. 2016).

   District court properly granted summary judgment quieting title in a tract of land to a buyer, directing the trust to convey the land to him, and dismissing the trust's counterclaims because, assuming there was fraud by the buyer, the counterclaims were untimely, the trust's acceptance of sporadic payments for more than 30 years waived the clause in the contract for deed making time of the essence, and, although the buyer might have continued to make sporadic payments to the trust and to record additional mortgages and satisfactions on the property, the trust was deemed to have constructive notice of the record in the recorder's office.

   District court correctly concluded that a mortgagee did not have constructive notice that an assignee’s mortgages were intended to encumber the subject property because although the mortgagee had a similar mortgage that included the same errant legal description, it did not have a duty to inquire further into the assignee’s mortgages to determine the correct legal description of the mortgaged property.

   Where a bank was not a subsequent purchaser but held a prior mortgage, a third party’s recording of its subsequent mortgage did not constitute notice to the bank of its contents, because the recording of a mortgage is not notice to a prior purchaser.

   A certificate of acknowledgment of a deed regular on its face is sufficient proof of the execution of the deed. Cox v. McLean, 66 N.D. 696, 268 N.W. 686, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 1936).

     <p>
      An unrecorded conveyance of real estate is void as against any subsequent purchaser in good faith, and for a valuable consideration, of the same real estate or any part of the same real estate, regardless of whether recorded in the form of a warranty deed or deed of quitclaim and release or the form in common use first is recorded or as against an attachment on the property or judgment, against the owner of record, before the recording of the conveyance. The fact that the first recorded conveyance is a quitclaim deed does not affect the question of good faith of the subsequent purchaser, or be of itself notice of any unrecorded conveyance of the same real estate or any part of the same real estate. This section is notice to all who claim under unrecorded instruments that prior recording of later instruments may nullify their title to or lien on affected real property. An action affecting any title to or lien on real property may not be commenced or defense or counterclaim asserted on the ground that a recorded instrument was not entitled to be recorded. The record of all instruments whether or not entitled to be recorded is deemed valid and sufficient as the legal record of the instruments.

   The mere failure to record an instrument given prior to the four-month period preceding bankruptcy, and its later recordation within the four-month period, does not result in a “preference” within the contemplation of section 60a of the National Bankruptcy Act. Hart v. Weiser, 57 N.D. 849, 224 N.W. 308 (1929), following Hart v. Weiser, 57 N.D. 634, 225 N.W. 78, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 307</cite> (N.D. 1929).

        Although mortgage holders must comply with statutory requirements as a prerequisite to being “received” for recordation, those requirements are no longer an independent basis from which liens may be voided by a trustee in bankruptcy when the mortgage instrument has been actually recorded.

   In an action seeking to quiet title in mineral interests, summary judgment was inappropriate because there were disputed issues of material fact about whether the buyers were good-faith purchasers for value without notice of a prior unrecorded deed. A deed that was executed in 1990, but not recorded until 2012, was valid between the parties to the instrument and those with notice, a statement of claim imposed a duty of further inquiry to ascertain the state of the ownership of the disputed mineral interests, and a buyer was deemed to have constructive notice of the facts an inquiry would have revealed. Desert Partners IV, L.P. v. Benson, 2016 ND 37, 875 N.W.2d 510, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 34</cite> (N.D. 2016).

   The mere failure to record a mortgage is not a ground for setting it aside by subsequent creditors who have acquired no specific lien on the property, but where the mortgage is kept off the record so that the mortgagor’s credit will not be impaired, the mortgagee is estopped to assert priority as against creditors without notice, who have become such on the faith of the record. Hart v. Casterton, 56 N.D. 581, 218 N.W. 644, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of this section was simply to give priority to subsequent purchasers and attachment or judgment lien creditors, without notice, over the rights of an unrecorded deed holder, as a matter of estoppel, and the section does not prevent title to property from vesting in the grantee under unrecorded deeds. Collins v. Federal Land Bank, 119 F.2d 228, 1941 U.S. App. LEXIS 3680 (8th Cir. N.D. 1941).

   If the instrument is deposited for record and the instrument is recorded by being entered in the reception book or spread at length upon the record, it will be constructive notice to subsequent purchasers for value, even though the recording fee is not paid at the time of depositing the instrument for record.

   The words “in good faith” have reference not only to subsequent purchasers but to attachment and judgment creditors as well. Ildvedsen v.

   Purchaser was not a good faith purchaser, and took subject to a prior unrecorded oil and gas lease, where vendor told purchaser prior to sale that there was an outstanding lease on the property, showed purchaser rental receipts from lessee, and purchaser made no further inquiry other than to check if such lease had been recorded.

   Highway department was not a good faith purchaser, and took subject to a prior unrecorded lease for the removal of sand and other materials, where at time highway department acquired its lease it was aware that sand and other materials had been removed from the property, the owner was not in possession of the property, and it had been informed of the prior lease but had been told by the owner that he thought it had expired; under such circumstances, the highway department had a duty, which it failed to carry out, to make an inquiry as to the prior unrecorded lease and was chargeable with the information that a diligent inquiry would have disclosed.

   The consideration recited in the defendants’ 1951 quitclaim deed was a nominal consideration and did not constitute a valuable consideration, therefore, defendants were not good faith purchasers for a valuable consideration and could not claim priority over the plaintiffs’ 1934 deed which was not recorded until 1983.

   In a dispute over an oil and gas lease, it was error for a trial court to grant summary judgment upon concluding, as a matter of law, that an individual was not a bona fide purchaser, due to having constructive notice of another’s claim when recording the lease, because (1) whether the individual had notice was a question of fact, (2) deciding an issue on summary judgment was not appropriate if the court had to draw inferences or make findings on disputed facts, (3) although two corporations argued the facts were not disputed, the corporations did not agree on the inferences that could be drawn from the evidence, (4) more than one inference could reasonably be drawn from the evidence and findings of fact were required, which was not appropriate in a summary judgment proceeding, (5) whether the individual acquired property rights in good faith and for value required findings of fact about the events surrounding a transaction, and (6) a factual dispute existed about whether the individual had constructive notice when the individual acquired rights under the lease.

   Summary judgment determining that plaintiff held the superior leasehold mineral interest was improperly granted as the trial court erred in determining that plaintiff was a good-faith purchaser for value without notice of defendant's interest when it executed the lease with the trustee because there was a material factual dispute over what plaintiff knew or should have known about defendant's interest as defendant was operating on the tract at the time and had permits for wells which he received on April 24, 2013; defendant provided an affidavit that a search of the tract index would have shown his leases after May 27, 2011; and there appeared to be facts and recorded documents which would have imposed a duty of inquiry on plaintiff.

   From a third party’s occupation of real property, including construction of a building and operation of a business, and from a subdivision plat which contained a notation of a contract for deed signed by the third party, a reasonable inference could be made that a written contract for deed existed; thus the judgment lienor was not entitled to summary judgment as to that property allegedly owned by the third party.

   A judgment creditor with actual notice that a party is in possession of the property upon which the judgment lien attaches must make reasonable inquiry of the possessor’s interest in the property.

   Prior to the 1959 amendment of this section, recording of mortgage which was improperly acknowledged did not constitute constructive notice as against subsequent creditor who lawfully obtained a judgment against the mortgagor.

         Constructive Notice.

       <p>

   One dealing with respect to real property is charged with notice of properly recorded instruments affecting the title thereto. Northwestern Mut. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Hanson, 72 N.D. 629, 10 N.W.2d 599, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>

   An instrument gives only constructive notice of its contents when deposited in the office of the register of deeds [now recorder], and when recorded the record relates back to the date of deposit and as of that time is constructive notice of the contents actually and correctly recorded. 74 N.W.2d 497; Northern Pac. Ry. v. Advanced Realty Co., 78 N.W.2d 705, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>

   Instrument that is erroneously indexed under wrong description in tract index does not give constructive notice; prospective purchaser or encumbrancer has no duty, insofar as constructive notice is concerned, to consult reception book or grantor-grantee indexes other than to determine if there are unrecorded and unindexed instruments in hands of register of deeds [now recorder]; consequence of failure to correctly index a mortgage in tract index falls upon mortgagee rather than subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer. Hanson v. Zoller, 187 N.W.2d 47, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1971).

       <p>

   Cotenant’s recording of oil and gas leases in which he was the only lessor, an affidavit stating that he was sole and only owner, and a contract for deed for the entire property in which he was the only grantor constituted only constructive notice of his ouster of the other cotenants and was not sufficient notice to establish a hostile ouster for purposes of establishing title by adverse possession against his other cotenants; this section does not imply that constructive notice of one cotenant’s claimed interest is chargeable to the other cotenants.

   The primary purpose of the recording statutes is to give notice of and to protect rights, as against subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers, not to create rights not possessed, either of record or in fact.

   Where a bank was not a subsequent purchaser but held a prior mortgage, a third party’s recording of its subsequent mortgage did not constitute notice to the bank of its contents, because the recording of a mortgage is not notice to a prior purchaser.

Knowledge of the record of an instrument out of the chain of title does not constitute such notice, provided, however, that the record of a mortgage, deed, or other conveyance prior to the recording of a deed or other conveyance vesting title of record in the mortgagor or grantor shall not be considered out of the chain of title after the recording of a deed or other conveyance vesting title in the mortgagor or grantor in such first recorded mortgage, deed, or other conveyance.

   One who had knowledge of facts sufficient to put a prudent man on inquiry with regard to the existence of an unrecorded deed, and failed to make such inquiry, could not claim protection under the recording act; buyer’s knowledge, before his tender of purchase price, that there was a mortgage on record against the property was the equivalent of actual notice of mortgagor’s unrecorded deed and defeated buyer’s claim of priority. Doran v. Dazey, 5 N.D. 167, 64 N.W. 1023, 57 Am. St. Rep. 550 (1895), decided prior to the 1899 amendment to former § 5042 (see now N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-04s32-04-25" target="_blank">32-04-25</a></cite>); distinguished, Simonson v.

   Because the plaintiff knew of an agreement between the defendants and lienholder for lienholder’s purchase of property on default of payment by purchaser, he should have made the lienholder a party to action to cancel contract for deed before entering judgment.

   Vendee had constructive notice of the terms of an unrecorded contract for deed between the vendor and a third party, including provision therein reserving the mineral interests to the third party, where the records in register of deeds’ [now recorders] office established that record title to the land was in the third party and vendor had no recorded interests; such facts were sufficient to put a prudent person upon inquiry concerning what right vendor had in the land, and such inquiry would have necessarily revealed the terms of the unrecorded contract for deed, which was in the vendor’s possession.

       </p>
       <p>

   It was no error to quiet title to real estate in owners, despite the owners not recording title until after purchasers bought the property, because the purchasers had constructive notice of the owners' conflicting interest, as the purchasers knew someone planted trees around the property, which was next to the owners' home, and that the owners watered the trees and otherwise maintained the property, but did not ask the seller if the owners bought or rented the property or if the seller had sold the property, so the purchasers were not good faith purchasers, as the owners' possession and occupancy was open and notorious. Chornuk v. Nelson, 2014 ND 238, 857 N.W.2d 587, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 242</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>

   In an action seeking to quiet title in mineral interests, summary judgment was inappropriate because there were disputed issues of material fact about whether the buyers were good-faith purchasers for value without notice of a prior unrecorded deed. A deed that was executed in 1990, but not recorded until 2012, was valid between the parties to the instrument and those with notice, a statement of claim imposed a duty of further inquiry to ascertain the state of the ownership of the disputed mineral interests, and a buyer was deemed to have constructive notice of the facts an inquiry would have revealed.

      When a change in the name or identity of a corporate mortgagee or assignee of the mortgagee is caused by or results from a merger, consolidation, amendment to charter or articles of incorporation, or conversion of articles of incorporation or charter from federal to state, from state to federal, or from one form of entity to another, a mortgage assignment, satisfaction, or release that is otherwise recordable and that specifies in the body of the instrument the merger, consolidation, amendment, or conversion event causing the change in name or identity is in recordable form. The assignment, satisfaction, or release is entitled to be recorded in the office of the county recorder without further evidence of corporate merger, consolidation, amendment, or conversion. For purposes of assigning, satisfying, or releasing the mortgage, the assignment, satisfaction, or release is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in it with respect to the corporate merger, consolidation, amendment, or conversion, and the county recorder shall rely upon it to assign, satisfy, or release the mortgage.

   Marketable Record Title Act did not prevent an eviction even if the farm had been in tenant’s possession for at least 20 years, as the chain of title was interrupted by mortgage which was placed upon the property and was subsequently foreclosed.

   One purpose of the Marketable Record Title Act is to simplify and facilitate land transactions from the record itself; that purpose is furthered by construing the plain language of N.D.C.C. § 49-19.1-09 to allow recovery of attorney fees and costs on appeal which are expended in defending a favorable judgment involving a slander of title claim. Here, the jury found the purchaser in the failed land transaction was liable to the sellers for slander of their title to the land; the sellers were entitled to attorney fees on appeal under that finding and the plain language of § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-19.1s47-19.1-09" target="_self">47-19.1-09</a></cite>.

   Schwab v. Zajac, 2012 ND 239, 823 N.W.2d 737, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 243</cite> (N.D. 2012).
      </p>
      <p>

   Evidence permitted an inference that the relatives intentionally filed notices and recorded instruments for the purpose of slandering title to the real estate or to harass the owners of the real estate; thus, the district court erred in granting summary judgment dismissing the claim for slandering title to real estate.

   Arndt v. Maki, 2012 ND 55, 813 N.W.2d 564, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 2012).

      <p>

   Appellee was not entitled to damages in its slander of title claim because there was no evidence that an appellant acted with malice as deliberate conduct without reasonable cause did not necessarily constitute malice; instead, there had to be evidence of an intent to injure, vex, or annoy.

      This chapter shall be construed to effect the legislative purpose of simplifying and facilitating real estate title transactions by allowing persons to deal with the record title owner as defined herein and to rely upon the record title covering a period of twenty years or more subsequent to the recording of a deed of conveyance as set out in section 47-19.1-01, and to that end to bar all claims that affect or may affect the interest thus dealt with, the existence of which claims arises out of or depends upon any act, transaction, event, or omission occurring before the recording of such deed of conveyance, unless a notice of such claim, as provided in section 47-19.1-05, shall have been duly filed for record. The claims hereby barred shall mean any and all interest of any nature whatever, however denominated, whether such claims are asserted by a person sui juris or under disability, whether such person is or has been within or without the state, and whether such person is natural, corporate, private, or governmental.

   Where, under a trust intended to terminate ten years after it took effect, at which time the property would vest, either in one of two principal beneficiaries, if certain conditions were met, or in specified remaindermen if they were not, the trustees failed to terminate the trust, and though the conditions were not fulfilled did not attempt to convey the trust property to remaindermen, plaintiff, who held the property under a chain of title running from the successor trustees to one of the principal beneficiaries and thence to him nearly forty years after the scheduled termination of the trust, could not use this chapter to defend his title against the heirs of the remaindermen, because of the provisions of subdivision (1)(b) of this section.

     <p>
      It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and perpetuate public land survey corners and information concerning the location of such corners by requiring the systematic establishment of monuments and recording of information concerning the marking of the location of such public land survey corners and to allow the systematic location of other property corners, thereby providing for property security and a coherent system of property location and identification of ownerships, and thereby eliminating the repeated necessity for re-establishment and relocations of such corners where once they were established and located, and, to authorize any registered land surveyor to locate, erect, maintain, record and perpetuate landmarks, monuments, section corners, quarter corners, meander lines or boundary lines heretofore or hereafter established.

      The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth’s surface, used in expressing the geographic position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of this system, shall consist of two distances, expressed in United States survey feet [meters] and decimals of a foot [meter] when using the North Dakota coordinate system of 1927. One of these distances, to be known as the X-coordinate, shall give the position in an east-west direction; the other, to be known as the Y-coordinate, shall give the position in a north-south direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented points of the North American horizontal geodetic control network as published by the national ocean survey/national geodetic survey, or its successors, and the plane coordinates which have been computed on the systems defined in this chapter. Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection to either North Dakota coordinate system. For the purposes of converting coordinates of the North Dakota coordinate system of 1983 from meters to feet, the international survey foot must be used. The conversion factor is: one foot equals 0.3048 meter exactly.

     <p>
      Whenever coordinates based on the North Dakota coordinate system are used to describe any tract of land which in the same document is also described by reference to any subdivision, line, or corner of the United States public land surveys, the description by coordinates must be construed as supplemental to the basic description of each subdivision, line, or corner contained in the official plats and field notes filed of record, and, in the event of any conflict, the description by reference to the subdivision, line, or corner of the United States public land surveys prevails over the description by coordinates, unless the coordinates are upheld by adjudication, at which time the coordinate description will prevail. This chapter does not require any purchaser or mortgagee to rely on a description, any part of which depends exclusively upon the North Dakota coordinate system, unless the description has been adjudicated as provided in this section.

   N.D.C.C. chs. 47-22 and 47-25 provide for registration of trademarks and tradenames in North Dakota, but do not, however, provide the underlying substantive law protecting infringement, which stems from common law.

   KAT Video Prods. v. KKCT-FM Radio, 1997 ND 21, 1997 N.D. 21, 560 N.W.2d 203, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (1997).
      </p>
      <p>

   To determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists between parties’ trademarks and tradenames, among the factors the court must examine are the strength of the trademark or tradename; the similarities between the marks; the competitive proximity of the products; the alleged infringer’s intent to confuse the public; evidence of actual confusion; and the degree of care reasonably expected of plaintiff’s potential customers.

   KAT Video Prods. v. KKCT-FM Radio, 1997 ND 21, 1997 N.D. 21, 560 N.W.2d 203, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (1997).
      </p>
      <p>

   While the corporation used the word “Burris” as part of its business name, it failed to present sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact that it has used the mark “Burris” in connection with its goods or services and that the mark has achieved secondary meaning; the corporation did not own any rights to the mark “Burris (the word),” and therefore the district court properly granted summary judgment dismissing the corporation’s statutory and common law trademark infringement claims.

   N.D.C.C. chs. 47-22 and 47-25 provide for registration of trademarks and tradenames in North Dakota, but do not, however, provide the underlying substantive law protecting infringement, which stems from common law.

   KAT Video Prods. v. KKCT-FM Radio, 1997 ND 21, 1997 N.D. 21, 560 N.W.2d 203, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   While the corporation used the word “Burris” as part of its business name, it failed to present sufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact that it has used the mark “Burris” in connection with its goods or services and that the mark has achieved secondary meaning; the corporation did not own any rights to the mark “Burris (the word),” and therefore the district court properly granted summary judgment dismissing the corporation’s statutory and common law trademark infringement claims.

       <p>

   To determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists between parties’ trademarks and tradenames, among the factors the court must examine are the strength of the trademark or tradename; the similarities between the marks; the competitive proximity of the products; the alleged infringer’s intent to confuse the public; evidence of actual confusion; and the degree of care reasonably expected of plaintiff’s potential customers.

   Chapters 47-22 and 47-25 provide for registration of trademarks and tradenames in North Dakota, but do not, however, provide the underlying substantive law protecting infringement, which stems from common law.

   KAT Video Prods. v. KKCT-FM Radio, 1997 ND 21, 1997 N.D. 21, 560 N.W.2d 203, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (1997).
      </p>
      <p>

   To determine whether a likelihood of confusion exists between parties’ trademarks and tradenames, among the factors the court must examine are the strength of the trademark or tradename; the similarities between the marks; the competitive proximity of the products; the alleged infringer’s intent to confuse the public; evidence of actual confusion; and the degree of care reasonably expected of plaintiff’s potential customers.

   KAT Video Prods. v. KKCT-FM Radio, 1997 ND 21, 1997 N.D. 21, 560 N.W.2d 203, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (1997).
      </p>
      <p>

   Corporation did not claim it was entitled to common law trade name protection, but claimed the family infringed upon its registered trade name; because the corporation did not have a registered trade name and was only claiming infringement of a registered trade name under N.D.C.C. ch. 47-25, the district court properly dismissed the corporation’s trade name claim.

   Corporation did not claim it was entitled to common law trade name protection, but claimed the family infringed upon its registered trade name; because the corporation did not have a registered trade name and was only claiming infringement of a registered trade name under N.D.C.C. ch. 47-25, the district court properly dismissed the corporation’s trade name claim.

     <ol>
      <li id="t47c47-25s47-25-02.1ol11">

         That creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient of the communication; and

        <li id="t47c47-25s47-25-02.1ol15a">
         A record to be in writing, an electronic record satisfies the requirement.

   A finding that a public utility’s price and volume data was a trade secret for purposes of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act did not automatically except that information from the open-records law.

   Where price and volume data contained in a natural gas distributor’s filings derived independent economic value from not being generally known to and not being readily ascertainable by providers of alternative fuel, and where this data was kept confidential by the company, the data constituted a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.

        Information an employee acquires about customers of his employer may be confidential if the specific attributes of the customers are important to a seller and not obvious. Kovarik v. American Family Ins. Group, 108 F.3d 962, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 5790 (8th Cir. N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former employer met its burden of establishing the necessity of a temporary restraining order because it showed there was a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits for its claim of trade secret misappropriation under N.D.C.C. § 47-25.1-01(2) against three former employees who solicited all the employer’s customers in a particular region; sufficient evidence showed that the former employees had already disclosed and/or used trade secret and confidential information regarding pricing, service, repairs, and technical expertise when soliciting or servicing the former employer’s customers on behalf of the former employees’ newly formed company.
        CDI Energy Servs. v. West River Pumps, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86293 (D.N.D. Nov. 20, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former employer’s customer information acquired by three of its former employees was likely to constitute “information” within the definition of trade secret under N.D.C.C. § 47-25.1-01(4) because the information the former employees acquired included intimate details of the customers’
        oil and gas well programs and strategies, the former employer’s costs and pricing, and the former employer’s customized solutions to their customers’
        individual needs; this was information that the former employer had taken steps to safeguard through both confidentiality and conflict of interest policies.
        CDI Energy Servs. v. West River Pumps, Inc., 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86293 (D.N.D. Nov. 20, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former employer, which sued former employees for claims including misappropriation of trade secrets under North Dakota law, was properly denied a preliminary injunction. The employer did not establish a likelihood of success on the trade secrets claim because it did not show that the customer information involved qualified as a trade secret under N.D.C.C. § 47-25.1-01(4); the employer’s potential customers were a small collection of easily identifiable, locally operating companies.
        CDI Energy Servs. v. West River Pumps, Inc., 567 F.3d 398, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 11649 (8th Cir. N.D. 2009).

       <p>
        Where loan agreements gave the lender a security interest in the borrowers’
        geophysical and seismic data, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the lender misappropriated confidential and proprietary information by disclosing it to a wholly-owned subsidiary and whether such information was improperly used for their gain either to secure maximum return or to “compete” with the borrowers in violation of N.D.C.C. § 47-25.1-01(2)(b)(2)(b) or (b)(2)(c).
        Macquarie Bank v. Knickel, 723 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65844 (D.N.D. 2010), aff'd, 793 F.3d 926, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 12356 (8th Cir. N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where loan agreements gave the lender a security interest in the borrowers’
        geophysical and seismic data, a confidential relationship was created between the parties due to the nature of the lending and net profits arrangement and the value of the information provided; the borrowers had a reasonable expectation that the lender would keep its information confidential, not disclose it to third parties, and not misuse the information for personal gain.
        Macquarie Bank v. Knickel, 723 F. Supp. 2d 1161, 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 65844 (D.N.D. 2010), aff'd, 793 F.3d 926, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 12356 (8th Cir. N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was properly granted to a lender on one borrower's misappropriation of trade secrets claim because the borrower was not the party from whom the misappropriation occurred for purposes of entitlement to a remedy. Macquarie Bank Ltd. v. Knickel, 793 F.3d 926, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 12356 (8th Cir. N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Borrowers successfully proved their misappropriation claim because the confidential information regarding development of the leases constituted a trade secret, and the lender used or disclosed it without consent or entitlement. Macquarie Bank Ltd. v. Knickel, 793 F.3d 926, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 12356 (8th Cir. N.D. 2015).

       Former employer met its burden of establishing the necessity of a temporary restraining order under N.D.C.C. § 47-25.1-02(1) because it showed there was a sufficient likelihood of success on the merits for its claim of trade secret misappropriation against three former employees who solicited all the employer’s customers in a particular region, and it showed that it would likely suffer irreparable harm through the misappropriation of its trade secret information resulting in the loss of the former employer’s well-established goodwill.

       Except to the extent that a material and prejudicial change of position prior to acquiring knowledge or reason to know of misappropriation renders a monetary recovery inequitable, a complainant is entitled to recover damages for misappropriation. Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other method, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator’s unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.

       Fencing of lands owned by different persons in severalty but occupied in common.

     <p>
      When lands belonging to different persons in severalty have been occupied in common by such persons without a partition fence between their respective lands and one of the occupants desires to occupy that occupant’s part in severalty, that occupant may apply to a majority of the proper fence viewers:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t47c47-26s47-26-14ol11">
       If the other occupant or occupants shall refuse or neglect, upon demand, to divide with the applicant the line where the partition fence ought to be built, to divide such line and assign to the parties the parts thereof upon which each party shall build the fence; or
      </li>
      <li id="t47c47-26s47-26-14ol12">
       If the other occupant or occupants, when the line has been divided, shall refuse or neglect, upon demand, to build a sufficient fence upon the line assigned, to order such fence built.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Upon a division or assignment as provided in subsection 1, the fence viewers, in writing over their signatures, may assign a reasonable time for building the fence, having regard to the season of the year. If either party shall not build that party’s part of the fence within the time assigned, the other party, after having completed that party’s part thereof, may build the part assigned to the other party or parties and recover therefor the ascertained expense thereof, together with the fees of the fence viewers.

   Trial court’s finding that the landlord was entitled to evict a holdover tenant under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t47c47-32s47-32-01" target="_self">47-32-01</a></cite>(4) after expiration of the commercial lease was not clearly erroneous.

      In any action for eviction the time specified in the summons for the appearance of the defendant may not be fewer than three nor more than fifteen days from the date on which the summons is issued. If the person cannot be found in the county, of which the return of the sheriff or process server is prima facie proof, and service has been attempted at least once between the hours of six p.m. and ten p.m. upon the filing of an affidavit of the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney stating that the defendant cannot be found or on belief that the defendant is not in this state and a copy of the summons has been mailed to the defendant at the defendant’s last-known address if any is known to the plaintiff, service of the summons may be made upon the defendant by the sheriff or process server posting the summons upon the door of the residential unit. In all cases arising under subsections 4, 5, 6, and 8 of section 47-32-01, three days’ written notice of intention to evict must be given to the lessee, subtenant, or party in possession, before proceedings can be instituted. The notice may be served and returned as a summons is served and returned or, if the party cannot be found, then by the sheriff of the county or a process server posting the notice conspicuously upon the premises. Service by delivery of a copy of the summons to the defendant in person within the county must be made at least three days before the time fixed for the appearance of the defendant. Service elsewhere or personal service in any other mode must be made at least seven days before the time fixed for the appearance of the defendant.

   District court abused its discretion in denying a lessor reasonable attorneys' fees as the prevailing party based on the terms of the lease because the district court did not treat the eviction as a summary proceeding; by extending the proceedings to allow for supplemental briefing and further motion, the district court should have addressed the legal issues raised in the post-hearing motion for attorneys' fees.

   In an eviction action, service by the landlord’s son was not improper because his affidavit of personal service stated that he was over the age of 18 and was not a party to nor interested in the action. He testified that he had served three-day notices in the past for his mother, and there was sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that he did not have an ownership interest in the property.

      An action of eviction cannot be brought in a district court in connection with any other action, except for rents and profits accrued or for damages arising by reason of the defendant’s possession. No counterclaim can be interposed in such action, except as a setoff to a demand made for damages or for rents and profits. If the court finds for the plaintiff in the action, the court shall enter judgment that the plaintiff have immediate restitution of the premises. Upon a showing by the defendant that immediate restitution of the premises would work a substantial hardship on the defendant or the defendant’s family, except in cases in which the eviction judgment is based in whole or in part on a disturbance of the peace, the court may stay the special execution for a reasonable period, not to exceed five days.
