   In a guardianship case, a ward's statutory rights were not violated because a district court substantially complied with this statute by accepting a physician's letter as the required physician's report. Even though an appointed expert refused to evaluate the ward, this letter provided a medical evaluation to the court satisfying the statutory requirements, and there was liberal construction of this title.

     <p>
      Whenever fraud has been perpetrated in connection with any proceeding or in any statement filed under this title, or if fraud is used to avoid or circumvent the provisions or purposes of this title, any person injured thereby may obtain appropriate relief against the perpetrator of the fraud or restitution from any person, other than a bona fide purchaser, benefiting from the fraud, whether innocent or not. Any proceeding must be commenced within two years after the discovery of the fraud, but no proceeding may be brought against one not a perpetrator of the fraud later than five years after the time of commission of the fraud. This section has no bearing on remedies relating to fraud practiced on a decedent during the decedent’s lifetime which affects the succession of the decedent’s estate.

   When the formal processes of admitting a will to probate, appointing a personal representative, or settling an estate are preceded by notice to all interested persons and a full adversarial hearing, the adjudication generally binds notified persons. An independent action for relief from fraud is authorized if it has not already been litigated in a formal testacy proceeding, and a party wronged by fraud may bring a timely action outside of the usual procedures and limitations.

   District court did not err in determining the ownership of the property at issue because its findings that an estate's failed to meet its burden of proving fraud or mistake were not clearly erroneous where the primary purpose of the estate's action was to reform a deed and determine ownership of property the estate alleged it owned, the statute of limitations was not applicable to the estate's quiet title and reformation claim, the estate's appellate brief did not attack the district court's findings of fact on fraud, and the evidence did not establish whether the son and the father's estate intended to change the personal representative's deed or whether the deed was fraudulently or mistakenly altered.

      In addition to the rules of evidence in courts of general jurisdiction, the following rules relating to a determination of death and status apply:

      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-01s30.1-01-04ol11">
       Death occurs when an individual is determined to be dead under chapter 23-06.3.

      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-01s30.1-01-04ol12">
       A certified or authenticated copy of a death certificate purporting to be issued by an official or agency of the place where the death purportedly occurred is prima facie evidence of the fact, place, date, and time of death, and the identity of the decedent.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-01s30.1-01-04ol13">
       A certified or authenticated copy of any record or report of a governmental agency, domestic or foreign, that an individual is missing, detained, dead, or alive is prima facie evidence of the status and of the dates, circumstances, and places disclosed by the record or report.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-01s30.1-01-04ol14">
       In the absence of prima facie evidence of death under subsection 2 or 3, the fact of death may be established by clear and convincing evidence, including circumstantial evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-01s30.1-01-04ol15">
       An individual whose death is not established under this section, who is absent for a continuous period of five years, during which the person has not been heard from, and whose absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search or inquiry, is presumed to be dead. The death is presumed to have occurred at the end of the period unless there is sufficient evidence for determining that death occurred earlier.

   Because a creditor’s claim for tort damages can be filed in a probate proceeding under this title, the death of a potential defendant before the period of the statute of limitations has run on a tort claim does not make N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-01s28-01-16" target="_blank">28-01-16</a></cite> ineffective, and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-01s28-01-26" target="_blank">28-01-26</a></cite> does not apply.

   Appellate court reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of a corporation in its action for specific performance to compel the estate to sell the decedent’s stock certificates because the action was a claim against the estate under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-01s30.1-01-06" target="_self">30.1-01-06</a></cite>(7) as it was a claim that sought to impose a liability on the estate based on a contract right to purchase shares, and it was barred by the limitation clause in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-03" target="_self">30.1-19-03</a></cite>(2)(b).

   In determining whether the adopted woman was a proper devisee of the estate of decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father who predeceased the decedent, courts pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.01.html#t01c1-02s1-02-03" target="_blank">1-02-03</a></cite> had to give terms that defined the relationship between people their peculiar and appropriate meaning as defined by statute.

   Where petitioner was attempting to establish ownership of property through an unprobated will as evidence of a devise, and did not claim that he, or anyone else, was an heir entitled to the minerals under the law of intestate succession, and also did not attempt to probate a will, the proceeding was not a “formal testacy proceeding” as defined by this section or N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-01" target="_self">30.1-15-01</a></cite>, and since N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-06" target="_self">30.1-15-06</a></cite> applies to a “formal testacy proceeding”, it did not directly apply here.

   Informal proceedings for determining testacy and appointing personal representatives generally do not have notice requirements, are basically ex parte in nature, and are handled administratively, not adversarially. Ketterling v. Gonzalez (In re the Estate of Ketterling), 515 N.W.2d 158, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1994).

   Decedent’s daughter, as the personal representative of her mother’s estate and as a residuary beneficiary and child of the decedent who stood to acquire the disputed property if her action was successful, qualified as an “interested person” under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-01s30.1-01-06" target="_self">30.1-01-06</a></cite>(25) with standing to bring the will contest. Therefore, the daughter had standing in a will contest proceeding and was not prohibited from relying on the alleged invalidity of her mother and second husband’s marriage as evidence of fraud.

   Black v. Richmond (In re Estate of Richmond), 2005 ND 145, 701 N.W.2d 897, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>

   Decedent’s child was an interested person and was able to petition for removal of a personal representative; moreover, a district court failed to follow the statutory requirements for hearings on the petition because it entered an order denying such without providing time to schedule a hearing. The child requested a hearing following the procedural requirements for doing so. Valer v. Bartelson (In re Estate of Bartelson), 2013 ND 129, 833 N.W.2d 522, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>

   Son could not require a personal representative's supplementary inventory because, once another child was held entitled to an entire estate, the son had no right in or claim against the estate, so the son was no longer an “interested person,” and the son showed no statutory ground for the relief sought. Estate of Pedro v. Scheeler, 2014 ND 237, 856 N.W.2d 775, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a dispute over the sale of farmland, a dismissal of an appeal was not warranted based on mootness because the sale was made to an interested person involved in the probate proceedings; therefore, a conveyance after a district court issued its order did not deprive the North Dakota Supreme Court of jurisdiction over the farmland. In re Estate of Johnson, 2015 ND 110, 863 N.W.2d 215, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>

   Because a personal representative could be an interested person, petitioner was not precluded from filing petitions as an interested person in the formal supervised probate administration while simultaneously performing her fiduciary duty as the personal representative to distribute the property according to the decedent’s will and the best interests of the estate. Bouchard v. Biel (In re Estate of Brandt), 2019 ND 87, 924 N.W.2d 762, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>

   Probate court had personal jurisdiction over the parties because all of the parties necessary for determination of the title to the decedent’s property interests that were transferred to the legacy trust fell within the definition of an interested person, and they were provided with notice of the hearing on the petitions; and all parties to the civil action were served with notice of hearing of the petitions to determine title and value to the property. Bouchard v. Biel (In re Estate of Brandt), 2019 ND 87, 924 N.W.2d 762, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   Where a person of lawful age personally appeared without being cited at a hearing called by a county judge on petition for a guardian’s appointment, and stated that she wished to have a person appointed as her guardian, and signed a written request for his appointment, the court acquired jurisdiction over her person to the same extent as if she had been cited.

   The county court did not err in determining that agreement between decedent and his wife, residents of Washington, providing that all their property would be considered community property, title to which would immediately vest in the survivor on the death of either spouse, had no effect on the disposition of decedent’s North Dakota real property.

        Under certain circumstances, it is appropriate to seek a summary judgment in probate appeals to the district court. Knudsen v. Knudsen, 322 N.W.2d 454 (N.D. 1982), decided prior to the amendment to this section by Session Laws 1973, ch. 352.

   County court has jurisdiction to review allegations of breach of fiduciary duty by the personal representative and excessive compensation of persons employed by a personal representative. In re Estate of Ridl, 455 N.W.2d 188, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>

   The county court has jurisdiction to order a person who has received excessive compensation to make a refund to the estate and to order the personal representative to pay for losses to the estate caused by a breach of a fiduciary duty. In re Estate of Ridl, 455 N.W.2d 188, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1990).

         Conservatorships.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Because the district court does not have jurisdiction over conservatorships, it is proper for it to stay its order pending a resolution of whether the conservator has the power to revoke the trust in county court. In re Bo, 365 N.W.2d 847, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 286</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   County court had authority to resolve the issue of whether conservator acted with a substantial conflict of interest in authorizing sale of farmland belonging to the estate to her son so as to determine if rescission of the contract was necessary.

   The decision in In re Estate of Jones, 288 N.W.2d 758, which was rendered prior to the 1983 amendment of this section, is no longer dispositive of the issues of equitable jurisdiction of the county courts.

   The right to appellate review of probate orders is governed by the rules applicable to appeals to the supreme court in equity cases from the district court. In re Estate of Sorensen, 406 N.W.2d 365, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 331</cite> (N.D. 1987).

Those requirements applied in the personal representative’s case because the personal representative was appealing from a ruling in an informal probate case that did not distribute all of the insurance proceeds, approve a final distribution, or discharge the personal representative, and, thus, because not all of the issues had been ruled upon and no N.D. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification had been obtained, the state supreme court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.

     <p>
      In formal proceedings involving trusts or estates of decedents, minors, protected persons, or incapacitated persons, and in judicially supervised settlements, the following apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol11">
       Interests to be affected must be described in pleadings that give reasonable information to owners by name or class, by reference to the instrument creating the interests or in another appropriate manner.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol12">
       A person is bound by an order binding another in the following cases:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol12a">
         An order binding the sole holder or all coholders of a power of revocation or a presently exercisable general power of appointment, including one in the form of a power of amendment, binds another person to the extent that person’s interests, as objects, takers in default, or otherwise, are subject to the power.
        </li>
        <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol12b">
         To the extent there is no conflict of interest between them or among persons represented, an order binding a conservator binds the person whose estate the conservator controls; an order binding a guardian binds the ward if no conservator of the ward’s estate has been appointed; an order binding a trustee binds a beneficiary of the trust in proceedings to probate a will establishing or adding to a trust, to review the acts or accounts of a former fiduciary and in proceedings involving creditors or other third parties; an order binding a personal representative binds a person interested in the undistributed assets of a decedent’s estate in actions or proceedings by or against the estate; and an order binding a sole holder or all coholders of a general testamentary power of appointment binds other persons to the extent their interests as objects, takers in default, or otherwise are subject to the power.
        </li>
        <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol12c">
         Unless otherwise represented, a minor or an incapacitated, unborn, or unascertained person is bound by an order to the extent the person’s interest is adequately represented by another party having a substantially identical interest in the proceeding.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol13">
       If no conservator or guardian has been appointed, a parent may represent a minor child.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol14">
       Notice is required as follows:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol14a">
         The notice prescribed by section 30.1-03-01 must be given to every interested person or to one who can bind an interested person as described in subdivision a or b of subsection 2. Notice may be given both to a person and to another who may bind that person.
        </li>
        <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol14b">
         Notice is given to unborn or unascertained persons who are not represented under subdivision a or b of subsection 2 by giving notice to all known persons whose interests in the proceedings are substantially identical to those of the unborn or unascertained persons.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03ol15">
       At any point in a proceeding, a court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interest of a minor, an incapacitated, unborn, or unascertained person, or a person whose identity or address is unknown, if the court determines that representation of the interest otherwise would be inadequate. If not precluded by conflict of interests, a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent several persons or interests. The court shall state its reasons for appointing a guardian ad litem as a part of the record of the proceeding.

   Because the district court, which applied the doctrine of partial invalidity, gave effect to a portion of a decedent’s will to distribute the decedent’s shares in a ranch, it could not be said the will did not effectively dispose of the shares. The laws of intestacy therefore did not apply. Grenz v. Grenz (In re Estate of Grenz), 2020 ND 189, 948 N.W.2d 320, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 2020).

   Trial court did not err in holding that the granddaughters of a decedent’s half-sister inherited the intestate estate of the decedent because even though the decedent expressly excluded the half-sister under the will, it could not be inferred that the decedent intended to exclude the granddaughters; the decedent did not expressly exclude the half-sister’s heirs pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-04s30.1-04-01" target="_self">30.1-04-01</a></cite>(2).

   Where a will did not include a residuary clause or residuary devise, property devised to a predeceased beneficiary did not pass by will, rather, pursuant to this section it passed by the law of intestate succession to the issue of the decedent’s parents because decedent had no surviving issue or parents.

   Because a devise in a will failed due to the fact that the devisee predeceased the decedent, an estate passed under the laws of intestate succession. A trial court erred by awarding a grandmother a portion of a decedent’s estate because the decedent’s wife was entitled to the entire estate through intestate succession, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-04s30.1-04-02" target="_self">30.1-04-02</a></cite>(1)(a); moreover, the decedent’s will did not expressly disinherit the wife, and the wife did not forfeit her right to receive the entire estate through the laws of intestate succession by not withdrawing her petition for exercise of an elective share since she was allowed to state more than one claim or defense.

   Upon death of an intestate, his realty passed immediately to his heirs subject, for purposes of administration, to control of county court and possession of any administrator appointed by that court.

   Although an estate was in the progress of administration, an heir of a decedent could maintain an action to determine adverse claims and quiet title to decedent’s real estate provided heir did not interfere with administrator’s possession of property for purposes of administration.

   Because a devise in a will failed due to the fact that the devisee predeceased the decedent, an estate passed under the laws of intestate succession. A trial court erred by awarding a grandmother a portion of a decedent’s estate because the decedent’s wife was entitled to the entire estate through intestate succession, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-04s30.1-04-02" target="_self">30.1-04-02</a></cite>(1)(a); moreover, the decedent’s will did not expressly disinherit the wife, and the wife did not forfeit her right to receive the entire estate through the laws of intestate succession by not withdrawing her petition for exercise of an elective share since she was allowed to state more than one claim or defense.

   Hartvickson v. Haugen (In re Estate of Haugen), 2011 ND 28, 794 N.W.2d 448, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 2011).

   Trial court did not err in holding that the granddaughters of a decedent’s half-sister inherited the intestate estate of the decedent because even though the decedent expressly excluded the half-sister under the will, it could not be inferred that the decedent intended to exclude the granddaughters; the granddaughters were the only descendants of the decedent’s parents.

   Indenture agreement between prospective adoptive parents and foundling home which permitted the indentured child to enforce provisions of the indenture allowing inheritance by the child from the prospective parents did not create the same relationship created by statutory adoption; therefore, the natural children of the prospective parents had no inheritance rights under the laws of intestate succession to the estate of the indentured child upon his death without lineal descendants.

   Indenture agreement between prospective adoptive parents and foundling home which permitted the indentured child to enforce provisions of the indenture allowing inheritance by the child from the prospective parents did not create the same relationship created by statutory adoption; therefore, the natural children of the prospective parents had no inheritance rights under the laws of intestate succession to the estate of the indentured child upon his death without lineal descendants.

   In determining whether the adopted woman was a proper devisee of the estate of decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father who predeceased the decedent, courts pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.01.html#t01c1-02s1-02-03" target="_blank">1-02-03</a></cite> had to give terms that defined the relationship between people their peculiar and appropriate meaning as defined by statute.

        Action by Child.

      <p>

   Prior to its amendment in 1977, this section permitted a child born out of wedlock to bring an action after the alleged father’s death to determine rights of inheritance; the child had to show decedent’s paternity by clear and convincing proof; evidence that decedent had lived with child’s mother both before and after child’s birth, had orally acknowledged child as his and had provided support for her constituted sufficiently “clear and convincing” proof; the child’s right to bring an action was not dependent on whether the mother had taken any action to establish paternity by written acknowledgment or judicial determination. C.L.W. v. M.J., 254 N.W.2d 446, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 283</cite> (N.D. 1977).

   Estate representative’s contention had to be rejected that the adopted woman was prohibited from inheriting from decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father, because the biological father did not act as the adopted woman’s father before the adopted woman turned 18-years-old, as required by

   District court’s decision stated that the wife, as surviving spouse of the decedent, was allowed to claim her elective share in the amount of $67,000, plus one-fourth of the estate under Mich. Comp. Laws Serv. § 700.2202; however, the court’s findings did not include any calculation for the reduction of one-half of the value of property derived by the wife from the decedent by any means other than testate or intestate succession upon his death, or for the addition of one-half of any balance of the intestate estate, and the court’s conclusory findings were inadequate to understand the basis for the court’s decision about an elective share.

   In a case in which the wife died during divorce proceedings after the district court had issued a judgment of divorce, but before resolving the issue of property division, the Supreme Court concluded that no reason existed for the husband to not inherit from the wife's estate. Because the divorce action was abated, the husband was not divorced. In re Estate of Albrecht v. Albrecht, 2018 ND 67, 908 N.W.2d 135, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 2018).

   Because a devise in a will failed due to the fact that the devisee predeceased the decedent, an estate passed under the laws of intestate succession. A trial court erred by awarding a grandmother a portion of a decedent’s estate because the decedent’s wife was entitled to the entire estate through intestate succession, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-04s30.1-04-02" target="_self">30.1-04-02</a></cite>(1)(a); moreover, the decedent’s will did not expressly disinherit the wife, and the wife did not forfeit her right to receive the entire estate through the laws of intestate succession by not withdrawing her petition for exercise of an elective share since she was allowed to state more than one claim or defense.

       Although under section 30.1-05-02 a payment, item of property, or other benefit is included in the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others, a payer or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument, or for having taken any other action in reliance on the validity of a governing instrument, upon request and satisfactory proof of the decedent’s death, before the payer or other third party received written notice from the surviving spouse or spouse’s representative of an intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed. A payer or other third party is liable only for actions taken two or more business days after the payer or other third party received written notice of an intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed. The written notice must indicate the name of the decedent, the date of the decedent’s death, the name of the person asserting an interest, the nature of the payment or item of property or other benefit, and a statement that the spouse intends to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed. Any form of service of notice other than that described in subsection 2 is not sufficient to impose liability on a payer or other third party for actions taken pursuant to the governing instrument.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-05s30.1-05-08ol12">
       The written notice must be mailed to the payer’s or other third party’s main office or home by registered mail or served upon the payer or third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Notice to a sales representative of the payer or other third party does not constitute notice to the payer or other third party. Upon receipt of written notice of intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed, a payer or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent’s estate, or if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents’ estates located in the county of the decedent’s residence. The availability of an action under this section does not prevent the payer or other third party from taking any other action authorized by law or the governing instrument. If no probate proceedings have been commenced, the payer or other third party shall file with the court a copy of the written notice received by the payer or other third party, with the payment of funds or transfer or deposit of property. The court may not charge a filing fee to the payer or other third party for any such payment, transfer, or deposit with the court, even if no probate proceedings have been commenced before the payment, transfer, or deposit. The court shall hold the funds or items of property and, upon its determination under subsection 4 of section 30.1-05-05, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. If no petition is filed in the court within the specified time under subsection 1 of section 30.1-05-05, or, if filed, the demand for an elective share is withdrawn under subsection 3 of section 30.1-05-05, the court shall order disbursement to the designated beneficiary. A filing fee, if any, may be charged upon disbursement either to the recipient or against the funds or property on deposit with the court, in the discretion of the court. Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payer or other third party from all claims under the governing instrument or applicable law for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

   Where decedent had a new will drawn up in which he left the bulk of his estate to his “wife,” where a footnote appearing in the document indicated that the will was prepared in anticipation of his wedding, and where the decedent died three days before his wedding, the probate court did not err in ruling that the terms “spouse” and “wife” as used and defined in the decedent’s will were descriptive of his fiancee and did not create a condition precedent to her right to receive the devises because the will’s definition of “spouse” and references to the decedent’s fiancee as his “spouse” were descriptive terms that did not create a condition precedent; rather, the footnote evidenced the decedent’s intent that the will be operative before and after the marriage. The district court properly concluded that the fiancee was an unconditional devisee entitled to take under the decedent’s will; the fiancee’s right to the devises to her vested at the decedent’s death.

        This section, the current pretermitted children statute, did not apply to case where child was born before testator’s will was executed; mere omission of child from the 1987 will was insufficient to raise an inference that child was omitted from testator’s will solely because he believed she was dead.

     <p>
      In addition to the homestead defined in section 47-18-01, the decedent’s surviving spouse is entitled from the estate to a value, not exceeding fifteen thousand dollars in excess of any security interests therein, in household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances, and personal effects. If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent’s minor children, whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by the decedent, are entitled jointly to the same value. If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than fifteen thousand dollars, or if there is not fifteen thousand dollars worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or such children are entitled to other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the fifteen thousand dollar value. Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, but the right to any assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier payment of the homestead allowance and family allowance. These rights are in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the decedent’s will, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.

   A wife’s antenuptial agreement that she should receive out of her husband’s estate, in case of his death prior to hers, the use of the homestead for life and two thousand dollars, and no more, did not deprive her of the statutory exemptions. Herr v. Herr, 45 N.D. 492, 178 N.W. 443, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1920).

      <p>

   An antenuptial agreement to accept a stated sum in lieu of the widow’s property rights or claims did not prevent the widow from claiming exemptions from the husband’s estate, since her right to exemptions was not in the nature of an interest in the property, but was a preferred claim against the estate.

       In addition to the right to homestead allowance and exempt property, the decedent’s surviving spouse and minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by the decedent are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the estate for their maintenance during the period of administration, which allowance may not continue for longer than one year if the estate is inadequate to discharge allowed claims.

It is payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children; otherwise to the children, or persons having their care and custody. If a minor child or dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be made partially to the child or the child’s guardian or other person having the child’s care and custody, and partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear. The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims except the homestead allowance.

       The family allowance is not chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession or by way of elective share. The death of any person entitled to family allowance terminates the right to allowances not yet paid.

   The county court, in its discretion, could make, by its order, an additional allowance for the maintenance of the family, though such order allowed a claim against the estate after the time for filing claims had expired.

       If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised may not be used to satisfy rights to exempt property. Subject to this restriction, the surviving spouse, guardians of minor children, or children who are adults may select property of the estate as exempt property. The personal representative may make those selections if the surviving spouse, the children, or the guardians of the minor children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time, or there is no guardian of a minor child. The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of distribution to establish the ownership of property taken as exempt property. The personal representative may determine the family allowance in a lump sum not exceeding twenty-seven thousand dollars or periodic installments not exceeding two thousand two hundred fifty dollars per month for one year and may disburse funds of the estate in payment of the family allowance. The personal representative or any interested person aggrieved by any selection, determination, payment, proposed payment, or failure to act under this section may petition the court for appropriate relief, which may include a family allowance other than that which the personal representative determined or could have determined.

   To defeat a will on the ground that the testator lacked soundness of mind due to an insane delusion, it must be established that the testator was possessed of a delusion that had no basis in fact or probability and was wholly the product of the imagination, that the will was the product of that delusion, and that the testator devised his property in a way, except for that delusion, he would not have done.

   The critical inquiry in determining testamentary capacity is directed to the condition of mind of the testator at the very time he signed the will. In re Estate of Stanton, 472 N.W.2d 741, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   Like undue influence, a will contest must prove testamentary incapacity by a preponderance of the evidence. Berquist v. Keller (In re Estate of Wagner), 551 N.W.2d 292, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 1996).

         Undue Influence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Elements necessary to invalidate a will on the basis of undue influence are that the testator was subject to such influence, the opportunity to exercise it existed, there was a disposition to exercise it, and that the result appears to be the effect of such influence; to be undue, the influence must operate at the time the will is made and must dominate and control the making of the will so as to make the will express the purpose and intent of the person exercising the influence and not the purpose and intent of the testator.

   This section is not applicable to an instrument attempting to be established as a will where the execution and death of the maker of the instrument occur prior to the effective date of this section. Kuhn v. Kuhn, 281 N.W.2d 230, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1979).

   It was no error to probate a decedent’s will because the decedent signed the will in the presence of two witnesses, who signed the will in the decedent’s presence, and all three signatures were notarized. Nordahl v. Jensen (In re Estate of Blikre), 2019 ND 257, 934 N.W.2d 867, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 267</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   It was no error to deny probate of a decedent’s alleged holographic will because the decedent’s handwritten documents were not such a will, as the documents (1) lacked testamentary intent, (2) did not specify whether items were to be distributed between sisters and nieces, (3) did not explicitly devise anything to anyone, and (4) were not signed by the decedent.

   Recitals in an attestation clause of a will are presumed to be true and can be used to establish due execution, unless the presumption of truth is overcome by clear and convincing evidence. In re Estate of Stanton, 472 N.W.2d 741, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1991) (decided under former section 56-03-02).

   District court did not err in determining appellant will proponent presented evidence strong enough to establish a prima facie case of due execution of decedent’s will in accordance with the requirements of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-08s30.1-08-02" target="_self">30.1-08-02</a></cite>, because the court relied upon the notes of the deceased attorney who drafted the will, the deposition testimony of the attorney’s secretary, and the testimony of a witness who saw the signed will.

        Burden of Proof.

   Burden of proof was on one who offered a will for probate to establish execution of will in manner prescribed by statute. Stormon v. Weiss, 65 N.W.2d 475, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1954).

        Compliance with Statutory Requirements.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Testamentary disposition of property of decedent was subject absolutely to control of governing statute, and failure to comply with statutory mandate concerning execution of a will was fatal to its validity. McKee v. Buck, 72 N.D. 86, 4 N.W.2d 652, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1942); Knudsen v. Lyons, 79 N.D. 595, 58 N.W.2d 845 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>

   Written instrument which made a testamentary disposition of real property that was not entirely written, dated, and signed by hand of purported testator had to be executed and attested in manner prescribed by former section. Johnson v. Weldy, 79 N.D. 80, 54 N.W.2d 829, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>

   A testator had to comply with all the formalities required by statute in the execution and attesting of a will or the will was not valid. In re Baur's Estate, 79 N.D. 113, 54 N.W.2d 891, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1952).

       No will was valid unless executed according to the provisions of the laws of North Dakota or according to the law of the place in which it was made, or in which the testator at the time was domiciled. Knudsen v. Lyons, 79 N.D. 595, 58 N.W.2d 845 (1953).

   A holographic will was not dated as required by former statute, unless it showed the day, month, and year when executed. Montague v. Street, 59 N.D. 618, 231 N.W. 728, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1930).

   A mark made by one intending by making it to execute a will, witnessed as provided in former statute, was sufficient to comply with requirements of statute. McKee v. Buck, 72 N.D. 86, 4 N.W.2d 652, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1942); Whelan v. Burris, 72 N.W.2d 884, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1955).

       Former law requiring a witness to write his place of residence with his name was directory, and failure of witness to write his place of residence did not invalidate a will that had been otherwise validly executed and attested. Hutchinson v. Charles, 75 N.W.2d 313 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The validity of the execution of a will was not dependent upon the former requirement that each witness write with his name his place of residence when the will had already been otherwise validly executed and attested. Hutchinson v. Charles, 75 N.W.2d 313 (1956).

        Proper Execution.

      <p>

   Where a will was subscribed in presence of attesting witnesses or acknowledged by testator to them to have been made by him or by his authority, testator at time declaring to attesting witnesses that instrument was his will and witnesses signing in his presence and at his request, it was properly executed under former section. Ouren v. Friswold, 55 N.D. 664, 215 N.W. 160, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1927).

        Subscribing Testator’s Name.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Person subscribing testator’s name to a will, who also signed as an attesting witness, was not required to state on instrument that he wrote testator’s name, since such fact could be shown on proof of the signature. In re Starke's Estate, 67 N.D. 178, 271 N.W. 131, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>

   Where name of testator was subscribed to will by another person as prescribed by former statute, signature to the will was sufficient. In re Starke's Estate, 67 N.D. 178, 271 N.W. 131, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>

   Where testator subscribed will in the presence of one attesting witness and acknowledged to other attesting witness that he signed will, attestation was sufficient. Collins v. Stroup, 71 N.D. 679, 3 N.W.2d 742, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1942).

   Proof of due execution was fulfilled under N.D.C.C. § 56-03-02, since repealed, by the affidavit establishing the signatures of two of the attesting witnesses which, with the attestation clause, raised a presumption of due execution.

   Under subsection (2) (now (1)(b)) of this section, revocation can only be accomplished when a physical mutilation of the will is coupled with the intent and for the purpose of revocation. Thus, regardless of the testator’s intent, a revocation is not effectuated unless there has been a mutilation of the will. In re Estate of Stanton, 472 N.W.2d 741, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   Obliteration, as used in former section, was an erasure or a blotting out of words with intent and for purpose of revoking those portions of will so obliterated; drawing lines through name of devisee and alternate executor constituted obliteration. In re Estate of Bogner, 184 N.W.2d 718, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>

   Obliteration of will was presumed to have been effected by testator where will had been in his custody, and was found after his death among his personal effects, and fell within any of the statutorily prescribed modes of revocation. In re Estate of Bogner, 184 N.W.2d 718, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>

   Testator’s partial revocation was valid where he evidenced intention to exclude daughter’s ex-husband by obliterating latter’s name wherever it appeared as devisee or executor, daughter already having been named joint devisee and executrix. In re Estate of Bogner, 184 N.W.2d 718, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1971).

        Proof.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Although proof of intent to revoke portion of will could be assumed from fact of obliteration, it was proper to show other facts and circumstances, including declarations of testator indicating an intent to revoke; failure to receive and consider such evidence would have been a dereliction of court’s duty. In re Estate of Bogner, 184 N.W.2d 718, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1971).

      If the court finds under chapter 32-23 that the will has been properly executed and that the plaintiff testator has the requisite testamentary capacity and freedom from undue influence, it shall declare the will valid and order it placed on file with the court. For the purposes of section 30.1-12-02, a finding of validity under this chapter shall constitute an adjudication of probate. The will shall be binding in North Dakota unless and until the plaintiff-testator executes a new will and institutes a new proceeding under this chapter naming the appropriate parties to the new proceeding as well as the parties to any former proceeding brought under this chapter.

   Whether or not an ambiguity exists in a will is a question of law; the supreme court will determine for itself the correct construction of an unambiguous will. Jordan v. Anderson, 421 N.W.2d 816, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   Whether an ambiguity exists in a will is a question of law for the court to decide; a will provision is ambiguous if it can be given more than one interpretation or understood in more than one sense.

   By ordering distribution according to payable on death (P.O.D.) designations of savings accounts, and an appropriate unequal distribution of the estate, district court properly gave effect to testator’s intent that accounts be divided equally while abiding by the law governing P.O.D. accounts. Berger v. Peterson (In re Estate of Peterson), 1997 ND 48, 561 N.W.2d 618, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 1997).

       <p>

   Where language of a will is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the testator must be determined from the language of the will itself; where language used in a will in unclear, indefinite and ambiguous, extrinsic evidence is permissible to show what the testator meant by what he said, but not to show what testator intended to say. Quandee v. Skene, 321 N.W.2d 91, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   A provision in a will is ambiguous when more than one interpretation may be given to the provision and it may be understood in more than one sense, and if the language of a will is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence is permissible to remove the ambiguity, however, extrinsic evidence is admissible only to show what the testator meant by what he said, not to show what he intended to say. Jordan v. Anderson, 421 N.W.2d 816, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>

   Extrinsic evidence was properly considered to determine decedent’s intent, and evidence supported a trial court’s finding in interpreting ambiguous provision in decedent’s will; the trial court found that decedent intended the beneficiary to physically farm crop land (as opposed to leasing out land to be farmed on a sharecropping basis), and if he failed to do so, his sibling had an option to buy the land.

       <p>

   The court’s purpose in construing a will is to ascertain the intention of the testator as it appears from a full and complete consideration of the will when read in light of the surrounding circumstances. In construing a will, each word, clause and provision should be given effect, if possible, and when the language of a will is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the testator must be determined from the language of the will itself. Schatz v. Schatz, 419 N.W.2d 903, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 54</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   When the court construes a will, its purpose is to ascertain the testator’s intent as it appears from a complete consideration of the will given the surrounding circumstances; if the language of the will is clear and unambiguous, the court determines the testator’s intent from the language of the will. Zimbelman v. Loh (In re Estate of Zimbleman), 539 N.W.2d 67, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>

   It is not essential that a testator understand the meaning of the technical clauses of a will, if the instrument is intended as a will and if it expresses the testator’s intent to distribute his property at death. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   Direct evidence that the decedent fully read and understood all of the provisions of his or her will is unnecessary. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   If a duly executed will contains the decedent’s general instructions for its contents, testamentary intent exists. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   Unless a duly executed will is ambiguous, the testamentary intent is derived from the will itself, not from extrinsic evidence. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>

   Where decedent had a new will drawn up in which he left the bulk of his estate to his “wife,” where a footnote appearing in the document indicated that the will was prepared in anticipation of his wedding, and where the decedent died three days before his wedding, the probate court did not err in ruling that the terms “spouse” and “wife” as used and defined in the decedent’s will were descriptive of his fiancee and did not create a condition precedent to her right to receive the devises because the will’s definition of “spouse” and references to the decedent’s fiancee as his “spouse” were descriptive terms that did not create a condition precedent; rather, the footnote evidenced the decedent’s intent that the will be operative before and after the marriage. The district court properly concluded that the fiancee was an unconditional devisee entitled to take under the decedent’s will; the fiancee’s right to the devises to her vested at the decedent’s death.

   Estate of Paulson v. Risovi, 2012 ND 40, 812 N.W.2d 476, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 2012).

   A declaration by decedent to his son that certain farm equipment was “yours and mine and to be left to you” was a present gift of one-half the property, but declaration as to half held by the deceased was testamentary in nature and could become effective only by compliance with the law of wills.

   Sole purpose of court in construing a will was to ascertain intention of testator as same appeared from a full and complete consideration of the will, when read in light of surrounding circumstances. If that intent could be ascertained and was not violative of some rule of law which existed for purpose of limiting power of testator to dispose of his property as he wished, such intent had to prevail.

   Intention on part of insured to dispose by will of avails of a life insurance policy made payable to his estate and hence payable to his heirs at law, must have been declared in clear and unmistakable terms; such intention would not be inferred from fact that will purported to dispose of all “property” of testator.

   Intention of testator had to be determined from terms of will itself, and where will was explicit courts were powerless to vary its terms. In re Kahoutek's Estate, 39 N.D. 215, 166 N.W. 816, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 1918).

       <p>

   In construing a will, substance rather than form had to be regarded. Imperfection or awkwardness of expression would not defeat testator’s intention; if it could be ascertained from will, such intention would be given effect regardless of form of words used and of absence of technical terms. In re Glavkee's Estate, 76 N.D. 171, 34 N.W.2d 300, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1948).

       <p>

   Where an unconditional devise of all decedent’s property was contained in a valid will, and such bequest was followed by precatory words not used in the imperative and not certain in meaning as to what devisee would do in distributing property to other relatives of decedent, such precatory words did not in any way destroy absolute devise of property.

   Fact that in one paragraph of a will testator devised by specific description property that he did not own would not justify court in taking an equivalent amount from a bequest which was definitely made to another, and in saying that fact that former property was not owned by testator justified the conclusion that he intended that his valid and definite bequests should be set aside.

   Where testator bequeathed and devised residue of his estate to four nonprofit charitable organizations, and he failed to provide for a gift over in event any of the residuary devisees ceased to exist at time of his death, there was no lapse of devise to one of organizations which had merged into another of charitable organizations before testator’s death, and, pursuant to former section 10-25-06 (see section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.10.html#t10c10-33s10-33-85" target="_blank">10-33-85</a></cite> et seq., for similar provisions) remaining merged organization was entitled to devise made to defunct organization where such disposition of devise in no way frustrated charitable intent of testator.

   In an action brought by a surviving spouse’s stepchildren challenging her inter vivos transfers of real estate to her natural child and her natural child’s husband on the grounds that it circumvented an alleged agreement between the father and stepmother for the disposition of their property upon their deaths, the father’s 1985 will clearly and unambiguously provided that his wife, the children’s stepmother, was to receive all of the rest, residue and remainder of his property if she survived him, which she did. The prior 1973 wills did not reflect an agreement by the father and his wife to treat all of the children equally upon the surviving spouse’s death; therefore, the wife became the sole owner of all of the assets of the father’s estate, other than a relatively small amount of money left to a stepdaughter of his and the stepmother acted within her rights and power in conveying assets to anyone she chose.

   That the validity and interpretation of a will relating to personal property was to be governed by laws of testator’s domicile was a long-established rule. Penfield v. Tower, 1 N.D. 216, 46 N.W. 413, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 1890).

   The provisions of a will relating to personal property situated in this state had to be considered according to law of domicile of testator at time of his death. Penfield v. Tower, 1 N.D. 216, 46 N.W. 413, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 1890); Crandell v. Barker, 8 N.D. 263, 78 N.W. 347, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

      If a governing instrument creating a power of appointment expressly requires that the power be exercised by a reference, an express reference, or a specific reference, to the power or its source, it is presumed that the donor’s intention, in requiring that the donee exercise the power by making reference to the particular power or to the creating instrument, was to prevent an inadvertent exercise of the power.

   Estate representative’s contention had to be rejected that the adopted woman was prohibited from inheriting from decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father, because the biological father did not act as the adopted woman’s father before the adopted woman turned 18-years-old, as required by

Although the biological father did not act as a parent towards the adopted woman between the adopted woman’s ages of three and 15-years-old, the biological father and adopted woman reconciled when the adopted woman was 15-years-old, and the trial court’s finding that the biological father then “functioned as a parent of the child” as defined under

In the absence of a conviction, the court, upon the petition of an interested person, must determine whether, under the preponderance of evidence standard, the individual would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent. If the court determines that, under that standard, the individual would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent, the determination conclusively establishes that individual as the decedent’s killer for purposes of this section.

        Absent an express statutory provision to the contrary, a renunciation is not treated as a fraudulent transfer of assets, and the renouncer’s creditors cannot on that ground claim any rights to the renounced property. Nielsen v. Cass County Social Servs. Bd., 395 N.W.2d 157 (N.D. 1986), decided prior to the 1987 amendment to N.D.C.C. § 50-24.1-02(1).

        There is no valid distinction upon which to allow the department of human services to benefit by treating a renunciation as a transfer where the renouncer’s creditors and the tax department cannot.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The legislature did not expressly make renunciation a disqualifying act under section 50-24.1-02(1), although it could have easily so provided; nor did it define the terms “assignment” or “transfer”. However, as commonly understood, those terms connoted an act of designating or conveying a thing from one person to another. One who assigned or transferred a property designated the assignee or transferee and the terms of the conveyance. In contrast, one who renounced a bequest or inheritance under this section could not designate the recipient or otherwise control the disposition of the renounced property. Nielsen v. Cass County Social Servs. Bd., 395 N.W.2d 157 (N.D. 1986), decided prior to the 1987 amendment to N.D.C.C. § 50-24.1-02(1).
       </p>
       <p>
        Department of human services’ contention that benefit recipient’s interest in her deceased mother’s estate should be treated as an available resource or that her renunciation of it should be treated as a disqualifying transfer under section 50-24.1-02(1) was inconsistent with the requirement of prior version of this section that a renunciation relate back to the death of the decedent “for all purposes”. Nielsen v. Cass County Social Servs. Bd., 395 N.W.2d 157 (N.D. 1986), decided prior to the 1987 amendment to N.D.C.C. § 50-24.1-01(1).

   Trial court did not err in holding that the granddaughters of a decedent’s half-sister inherited the intestate estate of the decedent because even though the decedent expressly excluded the half-sister under the will, it could not be inferred that the decedent intended to exclude the granddaughters; the residuary of the estate was to pass as though the half-sister disclaimed the intestate share under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-10.1s30.1-10.1-03" target="_self">30.1-10.1-03</a></cite>(4).

     <p>
      A will may be deposited by the testator or the testator’s agent with a recorder for safekeeping. The will must be sealed and kept confidential. During the testator’s lifetime, a deposited will must be delivered only to the testator or to a person authorized in a writing signed by the testator to receive the will. A conservator may be allowed to examine a deposited will of a protected testator under procedures designed to maintain the confidential character of the document to the extent possible, and to ensure that it will be resealed and kept on deposit after the examination. Upon being informed of the testator’s death, the recorder shall notify any person designated to receive the will and deliver it to that person on request or the recorder may deliver the will to the appropriate court.

      After the death of a testator and on request of an interested person, a person having custody of a will of the testator shall deliver it with reasonable promptness to a person able to secure its probate, and if none is known, to an appropriate court. A person who willfully fails to deliver a will is liable to any person aggrieved for any damages that may be sustained by the failure. A person who willfully refuses or fails to deliver a will after being ordered by the court in a proceeding brought for the purpose of compelling delivery is subject to penalty for contempt of court.

   Because the estate had insufficient liquid assets to pay the estate taxes without resorting to royalty payments, the district court did not err in finding an implied trust and in ordering the proceeds from life insurance policies to be applied to the estate tax obligation; the testator's children had equal ownership interests in the royalty payments upon her death, subject to administration, and they were entitled to the income from the royalty interests during the administration.

   Issues of merger are resolved by the parties’ intent and the interests of substantial justice, and where a substantial injustice would have resulted if merger negated the deceased’s intent under the plain and unambiguous language of his will, the court declined to apply the doctrine of equitable merger.

   This section provides that, upon death, a person’s real and personal property devolves to the devisees, subject to administration. Additionally, N.D.C.C. § 59-04.1-05(2)(a) [repealed] provides that devisees of specific property are entitled to income earned from that property during the administration of the estate. Stratton v.

   Title to property passes to a decedent's heirs or devisees at death, subject to a personal representative's broad powers over the title for administration purposes; a personal representative is allowed to lease and sell estate property if acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons. Therefore, although a personal representative might have been acting reasonably when she leased farmland, an income-producing asset of the estate, there was insufficient analysis or supporting evidence presented on the issue.

      No proceeding to enforce a claim against the estate of a decedent or the decedent’s successors may be revived or commenced before the appointment of a personal representative. After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by chapters 30.1-12 through 30.1-23. After distribution, a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-04" target="_self">30.1-21-04</a></cite> or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-05" target="_self">30.1-21-05</a></cite>. This section has no application to a proceeding by a secured creditor of the decedent to enforce the secured creditor’s right to the secured creditor’s security except as to any deficiency judgment which might be sought therein.

   Probate court had personal jurisdiction over the parties because all of the parties necessary for determination of the title to the decedent’s property interests that were transferred to the legacy trust fell within the definition of an interested person, and they were provided with notice of the hearing on the petitions; and all parties to the civil action were served with notice of hearing of the petitions to determine title and value to the property.

   The county court could obtain jurisdiction over a party by his personal appearance if the party was of full age and had not been judicially declared incompetent to manage his affairs, even though there was pending a petition to declare the person incompetent. In re Guardianship of Jones, 66 N.D. 185, 263 N.W. 160, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1935).

      <p>

   Where a person of lawful age personally appeared without being cited at a hearing called by a county judge on petition for a guardian’s appointment, and stated that she wished to have a person appointed as guardian, and signed a written request for his appointment, the court acquired jurisdiction over her person to the same extent as if she had been cited.

      Unless supervised administration as described in chapter 30.1-16 is involved, each proceeding before the court is independent of any other proceeding involving the same estate. Petitions for formal orders of the court may combine various requests for relief in a single proceeding if the orders sought may be finally granted without delay. Except as required for proceedings which are particularly described by other sections of chapters 30.1-12 through 30.1-23, no petition is defective because it fails to embrace all matters which might then be the subject of a final order, proceedings for probate of wills or adjudications of no will may be combined with proceedings for appointment of personal representatives, and a proceeding for appointment of personal representative is concluded by an order making or declining the appointment.

   A workable reconciliation of this rule and the “separate proceeding” provisions of an unsupervised administration is to treat a determination of all of one creditor’s claims against an estate as a separate proceeding which does not need a N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b) certification. However, if one creditor has more than one claim, an appeal from an order resolving some, but not all, of that creditor’s claims is premature without a N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b) certification.

     <p>
      No informal probate or appointment proceeding or formal testacy or appointment proceeding, other than a proceeding to probate a will previously probated at the testator’s domicile and appointment proceedings relating to an estate in which there has been a prior appointment, may be commenced more than three years after the decedent’s death, except:

      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-12s30.1-12-08ol11">
       If a previous proceeding was dismissed because of doubt about the fact of the decedent’s death, appropriate probate, appointment, or testacy proceedings may be maintained at any time thereafter upon a finding that the decedent’s death occurred prior to the initiation of the previous proceeding and the applicant or petitioner has not delayed unduly in initiating the subsequent proceedings.

       A proceeding to contest an informally probated will and to secure appointment of the person with legal priority for appointment in the event the contest is successful may be commenced within the later of twelve months from the informal probate or three years from the decedent’s death.

       An informal appointment or a formal testacy or appointment proceeding may be commenced thereafter if no proceeding concerning the succession or estate administration has occurred within the three-year period after the decedent’s death, but the personal representative has no right to possess estate assets as provided in section 30.1-18-09 beyond that necessary to confirm title to the assets in the successors to the estate and claims other than expenses of administration may not be presented against the estate.

       A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced at any time after three years from the decedent’s death for the purpose of establishing an instrument to direct or control the ownership of property passing or distributable after the decedent’s death from one other than the decedent when the property is to be appointed by the terms of the decedent’s will or is to pass or be distributed as a part of the decedent’s estate or its transfer is otherwise to be controlled by the terms of the decedent’s will.

      These limitations do not apply to proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs of an intestate.

        Although the district court had diversity jurisdiction over a suit brought by three former designated beneficiaries of accounts owned by a deceased great aunt, the probate exception applied to bar the court from exercising jurisdiction over the beneficiaries’ suit because the probate of the great aunt’s will was closely intertwined with the beneficiaries’ allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the representative and sole beneficiary of the great aunt’s estate and the beneficiaries’ claims for relief included imposing a constructive trust on assets in the estate of the great aunt’s husband. The beneficiaries had time to file a suit pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 30.1-12-08(3) to contest the informal probate of the great aunt’s will, and the state court was the proper forum to invalidate the wills of the great aunt and/or her husband.

   Because a personal representative could be an interested person, petitioner was not precluded from filing petitions as an interested person in the formal supervised probate administration while simultaneously performing her fiduciary duty as the personal representative to distribute the property according to the decedent’s will and the best interests of the estate.

         Preference for Heir.

       </h5>
       <p>

   As a general rule and in accordance with the statutory provisions, a domiciled heir, a member of the family in its enlarged sense, if available, is and should be given priority for appointment as personal representative or administrator; however, this is not an inflexible position and extenuating circumstances may, and at certain times must, be considered. In re Estate of Engeseth, 352 N.W.2d 631, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 358</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where conservator of estate of one sister of the intestate decedents and another sister of the intestate decedents both petitioned to have themselves appointed as administrator and personal representative over the estates, and none of the other heirs appeared or expressed any objection or preference between the conservator and the sister, the court acted properly under this section in appointing the conservator, who was the county public administrator, as administrator and personal representative of the estates where more than three years had passed since the death of one decedent without any heir taking action; sister filed her petition only after conservator first filed; sister’s residence in California would involve unneeded duplicity and difficulty; and it was determined to be in the best interests of all three estates to have one person handle them all. In re Estate of Engeseth, 352 N.W.2d 631, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 358</cite> (N.D. 1984).

       Demand for notice of order or filing concerning decedent’s estate.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person desiring notice of any order or filing pertaining to a decedent’s estate in which the person has a financial or property interest may file a demand for notice with the court, at any time after the death of the decedent, stating the name of the decedent, the nature of the person’s interest in the estate, and the demandant’s address or that of the demandant’s attorney. The clerk shall mail a copy of the demand to the personal representative, if one has been appointed. After filing of a demand, no order or filing to which the demand relates shall be made or accepted without notice, as prescribed in section 30.1-03-01, to the demandant or the demandant’s attorney. The validity of an order which is issued or filing which is accepted without compliance with this requirement shall not be affected by the error, but the petitioner receiving the order or the person making the filing may be liable for any damage caused by the absence of notice. The requirement of notice arising from a demand under this provision may be waived in writing by the demandant and shall cease upon the termination of the demandant’s interest in the estate.

   Upon learning of decedent’s death, proper procedure for claimant against estate for tort of decedent is to petition for appointment of herself as the personal representative of decedent’s estate under this section; if others with higher priority for appointment refuse, she can then present her claim against the estate before the statute of limitations runs out.

   District court erred in finding that the testator’s missing will was not presumed to be revoked, because while N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-08s30.1-08-07" target="_self">30.1-08-07</a></cite> did not speak to admitting a lost will and neither N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-14s30.1-14-03" target="_self">30.1-14-03</a></cite> nor <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-02" target="_self">30.1-15-02</a></cite> provided specific presumptions for admitting a missing will, the drafter’s of the Uniform Probate Code did contemplate the probate of lost wills, and the district court erroneously failed to apply the common law amino revocandi presumption that a missing will was revoked; if a will could not be found upon the death of the testator, the presumption arose that the testator revoked the missing will, and under N.D.R.Ev. 301(a), the party seeking to probate the missing will must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the testator did not destroy or revoke the missing will animo revocandi.

       A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will. A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing a petition as described in subsection 1 of section 30.1-15-02 in which the interested person requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will which is the subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with subsection 2 of section 30.1-15-02 for an order that the decedent died intestate.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-01ol12">
       A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated. A formal testacy proceeding may, but need not, involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-01ol13">
       During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the court shall not act upon any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-01ol14">
       Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain from exercising the power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding. A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the powers of that office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator. In the absence of a request, or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.

   District court erred in finding that the testator’s missing will was not presumed to be revoked, because while N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-08s30.1-08-07" target="_self">30.1-08-07</a></cite> did not speak to admitting a lost will and neither N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-14s30.1-14-03" target="_self">30.1-14-03</a></cite> nor <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-02" target="_self">30.1-15-02</a></cite> provided specific presumptions for admitting a missing will, the drafter’s of the Uniform Probate Code did contemplate the probate of lost wills, and the district court erroneously failed to apply the common law amino revocandi presumption that a missing will was revoked; if a will could not be found upon the death of the testator, the presumption arose that the testator revoked the missing will, and under N.D.R.Ev. 301(a), the party seeking to probate the missing will must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the testator did not destroy or revoke the missing will animo revocandi.

      If a petition in a testacy proceeding is unopposed, the court may order probate or intestacy on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of section 30.1-15-09 have been met, or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters necessary to support the order sought. If evidence concerning execution of the will is necessary, the affidavit or testimony of one of any attesting witnesses to the instrument is sufficient. If the affidavit or testimony of an attesting witness is not available, execution of the will may be proved by other evidence or affidavit.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship. Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases, and, if they are also petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue. Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, revocation, or other cause affecting its validity. Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof. If a will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former, it shall be determined first whether the later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, it shall be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.

   Where it was clear that testator intended to draft the instrument and that he intended to sign it, it was irrelevant whether he harbored some secret intention that his actions would have no effect on the disposition of his estate; the consequence of drafting and executing an unambiguous will is that it will have legal effect upon the testator’s death. Norback v. Duemeland (In re Estate of Duemeland), 528 N.W.2d 369, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        Although this section generally recognizes mistake, along with several other grounds, as a basis for contesting the validity of a will, N.D.C.C. § 30.1-06-02 specifically controls whether the omission of a child from a will was because of mistake or was intentional.

   Since the trial court instructed that plaintiff, as the person contesting the will, had the burden of proof, there was no error in declining to further instruct that one who makes a will is presumed sane as this presumption was already a function of the burden of proof on the contestant as the trial court instructed.

   District court did not err in determining appellant will proponent presented evidence strong enough to establish met his burden under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-07" target="_self">30.1-15-07</a></cite> of proving due execution of decedent’s will, because the court relied upon the notes of the deceased attorney who drafted the will, the deposition testimony of the attorney’s secretary, and the testimony of a witness who saw the signed will. Because the will could not be found upon decedent’s death, the district court correctly applied the presumption that the missing will had been revoked.

   Testamentary capacity is presumed and the burden of proving lack of capacity is on contestants, who also have the burden of sustaining a challenge to the validity of a will on the ground of undue influence. In re Estate of Papineau, 396 N.W.2d 735, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 442</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   Under this section, the contestants of a will have the burden of proving lack of testamentary capacity. In re Estate of Aune, 478 N.W.2d 561, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   Direct evidence that the decedent fully read and understood all of the provisions of his or her will is unnecessary. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>

   It is not essential that a testator understand the meaning of the technical clauses of a will, if the instrument is intended as a will and if it expresses the testator’s intent to distribute his property at death. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   The question of whether a testator was suffering from an insane delusion which materially affected the will is a question of fact. The contestants must establish that the will was a product of the insane delusion and that the testator, if not laboring under the insane delusion, would have differently devised the property. In re Estate of Aune, 478 N.W.2d 561, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>

   Because appellant, who claimed that her father's will was the product of an insane delusion, did not make an appropriate offer of proof to properly preserve issues about evidence she claimed was improperly excluded, the district court did not improperly preclude appellant from presenting evidence about her father's alleged mental illness.

   There is no presumption of undue influence where the proponent of the will, while occupying a confidential relationship with the testator, participated in the preparation or procurement of the will and received a substantial bequest or benefit thereunder. In re Estate of Wagner, 265 N.W.2d 459, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>

   Contestant to the will carried the burden of proving that the will was the result of undue influence. In re Estate of Stenerson, 348 N.W.2d 141, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>

   Elements necessary to invalidate a will on the ground of undue influence are: that the testator was subject to such influence; that the opportunity to exercise it existed; that there was a disposition to exercise it; and that the result appears to be the effect of such influence. In re Estate of Stenerson, 348 N.W.2d 141, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>

   The determination of whether or not a testator was unduly influenced is a question of fact, and that determination, when made by the district court as finder of fact, will not be set aside on appeal unless clearly erroneous. In re Estate of Stenerson, 348 N.W.2d 141, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>

   To be undue, the influence must dominate and control the making of the will such as to make the will express the purpose and intent of the person exercising the influence rather than the testator’s purpose and intent. In re Estate of Stenerson, 348 N.W.2d 141, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>

   Elements necessary to invalidate a will on the basis of undue influence are that the testator was subject to such influence, the opportunity to exercise it existed, there was a disposition to exercise it, and that the result appears to be the effect of such influence; to be undue, the influence must operate at the time the will is made and must dominate and control the making of the will so as to make the will express the purpose and intent of the person exercising the influence and not the purpose and intent of the testator. Okken v. Okken Estate, 348 N.W.2d 447, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 297</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>

   Evidence which raises a mere suspicion of undue influence is insufficient to support a finding of undue influence. In re Estate of Polda, 349 N.W.2d 11, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>

   There is no presumption of undue influence, and the burden of proof does not shift to the proponent of the will to show lack of undue influence, where a confidential relationship exists between the proponent and the testator, coupled with the proponent participating in the preparation of the will and receiving a benefit by its terms. In re Estate of Polda, 349 N.W.2d 11, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 1984).

   When the formal processes of admitting a will to probate, appointing a personal representative, or settling an estate are preceded by notice to all interested persons and a full adversarial hearing, the adjudication generally binds notified persons. An independent action for relief from fraud is authorized, if it has not already been litigated in a formal testacy proceeding, and a party wronged by fraud may bring a timely action outside of the usual procedures and limitations.

        Interpretation of Statutes.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   A statute making a decree granting the probate of a will conclusive unless reversed, or vacated had to be read in conjunction with the statute providing for appeal to the district court from a decision of the county court affecting substantial rights, and the statute providing for contesting of a will after probate. In re McKee's Estate, 67 N.D. 504, 274 N.W. 601, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 1937); Tooz v. Tooz, 78 N.D. 432, 50 N.W.2d 61, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

         Jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   In a statutory proceeding to contest a will after probate, the court would not consider a challenge on the ground that a jurisdictional fact was wanting in probate where the petitioners submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and asked for a determination as to the validity of the will. In re McKee's Estate, 67 N.D. 504, 274 N.W. 601, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 1937).
       </p>
       <p>

   A decree of the county court could be attacked by motion in the proceeding in which it was rendered at any time on the ground of the nonexistence of any fact necessary to jurisdiction. In re Anderson's Estate, 76 N.D. 163, 34 N.W.2d 413, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1948); Knudsen v. Lyons, 79 N.D. 595, 58 N.W.2d 845 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where final decree in probate sale was entered on November 21, 1941, and petition to set aside sale and have estate reopened was filed in 1948, the only matter that the petitioner could have considered on appeal was whether any fact in the proceedings of the county court necessary to jurisdiction was nonexistent. Skachenko v. Sweetman, 77 N.D. 502, 43 N.W.2d 683, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1950).

   Upon an appeal taken generally from the county to the district court in a proceeding for the contest of a will after probate, district court could grant motion for a summary judgment where petition upon which the purported contest was based failed to state the required statutory grounds. Hoppin v. Fortin, 111 N.W.2d 122, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1961).

   An order of the county court granting a rehearing for the causes and within the time specified in former sections dealing with rehearings, which did not determine legal rights or affect the subject matter of the proceeding in which it was issued, was not appealable to the district court as affecting substantial rights.

       <p>

   In order to contest a will after probate, it was required that a sworn petition in writing be filed containing allegations that evidence discovered since probate of the will, the material facts of which had to be set forth, showed at least one of the four grounds set out in the statute for contesting the will. Hoppin v. Fortin, 111 N.W.2d 122, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1961).

     <p>
      Supervised administration is a single in rem proceeding to secure complete administration and settlement of a decedent’s estate under the continuing authority of the court which extends until entry of an order approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative, or other order terminating the proceeding. A supervised personal representative is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested parties, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a supervised personal representative has the same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not supervised.

        Appeal of Order in Supervised Administration.

      </p>
      <p>

   Appellate court could hear a son's appeal of a will's interpretation because (1) orders entered in the supervised probate proceeding were not final until a final distribution was approved, and (2) the son's notice of appeal was timely filed after the final order of distribution was entered. Grengs v. Lakefield (Estate of Grengs), 2015 ND 152, 864 N.W.2d 424, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>

   A workable reconciliation of this rule and the “separate proceeding” provisions of an unsupervised administration is to treat a determination of all of one creditor’s claims against an estate as a separate proceeding which does not need a Rule 54(b) certification. However, if one creditor has more than one claim, an appeal from an order resolving some, but not all, of that creditor’s claims is premature without a Rule 54(b) certification. In re Estate of Starcher, 447 N.W.2d 293, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1989).

Bond required by any will may be dispensed with in formal proceedings upon determination by the court that it is not necessary. No bond is required of any personal representative who, pursuant to statute, has deposited cash or collateral with an agency of this state to secure performance of the personal representative’s duties.

     <p>
      If bond is required and the provisions of the will or order do not specify the amount, unless stated in that person’s application or petition, the person qualifying shall file a statement under oath with the court indicating that person’s best estimate of the value of the personal estate of the decedent and of the income expected from the personal and real estate during the next year, and shall execute and file a bond with the court, or give other suitable security, in an amount not less than the estimate. The court shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or one or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property, or other adequate security. The court may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of assets of the estate deposited with a domestic financial institution, as defined in section 30.1-31-02, in a manner that prevents their unauthorized disposition. On petition of the personal representative or another interested person, the court may excuse a requirement of bond, increase or reduce the amount of the bond, release sureties, or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties.

   A sale of real property of an intestate in the course of administration was not invalid because order of license to sell did not require an additional bond to be given by the administrator, where the administrator had given a surety bond for one thousand dollars as required by C.L. 1913, § 8685, no personal property remained in the estate, and the real estate had been appraised at one thousand six hundred dollars.

       Demand for bond by interested person.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person apparently having an interest in the estate worth in excess of one thousand dollars, or any creditor having a claim in excess of one thousand dollars, may make a written demand that a personal representative give bond. The demand must be filed with the court and a copy mailed to the personal representative if appointment and qualification have occurred. Thereupon, bond is required, but the requirement ceases if the person demanding bond ceases to be interested in the estate, or if bond is excused as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-03" target="_self">30.1-17-03</a></cite> or <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-04" target="_self">30.1-17-04</a></cite>. After receiving notice and until the filing of the bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain from exercising any powers of office except as necessary to preserve the estate. Failure of the personal representative to meet a requirement of bond by giving suitable bond within thirty days after receipt of notice is cause for removal and appointment of a successor personal representative.

     <p>
      Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-09" target="_self">30.1-17-09</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-12" target="_self">30.1-17-12</a></cite>. Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the office of personal representative as conferred by this title or any will, except that a personal representative, at any time prior to distribution or until restrained or enjoined by court order, may perform acts necessary to protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a successor representative. Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination, or relieve the personal representative of the duty to preserve assets subject to the personal representative’s control, to account therefor, and to deliver the assets. Termination does not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the personal representative, but terminates the personal representative’s authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding.

Unless the decedent’s will directs otherwise, a personal representative appointed at the decedent’s domicile, incident to securing appointment of the personal representative or the personal representative’s nominee as ancillary personal representative, may obtain removal of another who was appointed personal representative in this state to administer local assets.

   The county court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that individual should be removed as personal representative of decedent’s estate where he believed he was the joint owner with decedent of a $49,898.77 account; believed he was entitled to the interest accumulated on the account from the date of its establishment; knew that the residuary devisees and legatees claimed the account to be part of decedent’s estate; understood that there would be a conflict of interest between his fiduciary duty and obligation as personal representative and his personal claim to the proceeds; as personal representative, withdrew all of the assets of the estate from decedent’s conservator and deposited the funds in another bank; and furnished no bond as personal representative because none was required by the terms of decedent’s will. Jarmin v. Shriners Hosps. for Crippled Children, 450 N.W.2d 750, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 1990).

   Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant appellant’s request to remove the personal representative where appellant’s failed to show how the personal representative mismanaged the estate or failed to perform a duty; appellants failed to object to the sale of decedant’s land or to offer to purchase it after receiving notice of a purchase offer; failed to prove ownership of personal property sold at the estate auction sale; and failed to prove the value of items sold which they claimed were undervalued.

   Order denying the heirs’

   petition to remove the estate’s personal representative was appealable without a certification, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition because although appropriate and timely notices were not given and a timely inventory and appraisal were not provided, the heirs failed to show that there had been mismanagement or that the representative’s untimely notices were a detriment to the heirs or estate. Puhr v. Novak (In re Estate of Shubert), 2013 ND 215, 839 N.W.2d 811, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 203</cite> (N.D. 2013).

   District court did not abuse its discretion in denying a son’s petition to remove a widow as personal representative of an intestate’s estate because it did not misapply the law, and it provided a reasoned explanation for its determination; the district court found that the widow had done nothing inappropriate. Estate of Huston v. Huston, 2014 ND 29, 843 N.W.2d 3, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 2014).

   It was not an abuse of discretion to decline a beneficiary's request to remove the personal representative of a decedent's estate because a cursory review of the record reflected a contentious probate dispute between the parties and their attorneys.

   When the co-personal representatives filed cross-motions for removal of the other co-personal representative from the administration of the decedent’s unsupervised estate, the district court’s determination of which co-personal representative to remove was appropriate because the court found that the conduct of the co-personal representative who was not removed had been appropriate and that the conduct, or lack of conduct, of the co-personal representative who was removed had been inappropriate.

   The mere fact that a personal representative has an interest in the estate he or she is administering is, generally, an insufficient conflict of interest to justify the removal of the personal representative.

After appointment and qualification, a successor personal representative may be substituted in all actions and proceedings to which the former personal representative was a party, and no notice, process, or claim which was given or served upon the former personal representative need be given to or served upon the successor in order to preserve any position or right the person giving the notice or filing the claim may thereby have obtained or preserved with reference to the former personal representative.

     <p>
      The duties and powers of a personal representative commence upon appointment. The powers of a personal representative relate back in time to give acts by the person appointed which are beneficial to the estate occurring prior to appointment the same effect as those occurring thereafter. Prior to appointment, a person named executor in a will may carry out written instructions of the decedent relating to the decedent’s body, funeral, and burial arrangements. A personal representative may ratify and accept acts on behalf of the estate done by others if the acts would have been proper for a personal representative.

A personal representative is under a duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of any probated and effective will and this title, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate.

       A personal representative may not be surcharged for acts of administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time. Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will authorizes a personal representative to administer and distribute the estate according to its terms. An order of appointment of a personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal proceedings, authorizes the personal representative to distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the decedent if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning the personal representative’s appointment or fitness to continue, or a supervised administration proceeding. This section does not affect the duty of the personal representative to administer and distribute the estate in accordance with the rights of claimants whose claims have been allowed, the surviving spouse, any minor and dependent children, and any pretermitted child of the decedent as described in this title.

   Where personal representative improperly prepared and filed estate tax returns, failed to properly distribute estate assets, caused overdraft and service charges against estate accounts, and paid himself unreasonable and excessive attorney fees, fiduciary duty imposed by this section was breached. In re Estate of Ridl, 455 N.W.2d 188, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1990).

   Generally, a personal representative has the duty, as well as the right, to defend the will by all fair means, and with his best efforts, at least where he has reasonable ground to believe the will is valid. In re Estate of Flaherty, 484 N.W.2d 515, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1992).

     <p>
      Not later than thirty days after appointment, every personal representative, except any special administrator, shall give information of the appointment to the heirs and devisees, including, if there has been no formal testacy proceeding and if the personal representative was appointed on the assumption that the decedent died intestate, the devisees in any will mentioned in the application for appointment of a personal representative. The information must be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative. The duty does not extend to require information to persons who have been adjudicated in a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate. The information must include the name and address of the personal representative, indicate that it is being sent to persons who have or may have some interest in the estate being administered, indicate whether bond has been filed, and describe the court where papers relating to the estate are on file. The information must state that the estate is being administered by the personal representative under this title without supervision by the court, but that recipients are entitled to information regarding the administration from the personal representative and may petition the court in any matter relating to the estate, including distribution of assets and expenses of administration. The personal representative’s failure to give this information is a breach of duty to the persons concerned but does not affect the validity of the appointment, the personal representative’s powers, or other duties. A personal representative may inform other persons of the appointment by delivery or ordinary first-class mail.

   Personal representative of decedent’s estate has authority to lease estate property for the benefit of joint devisees, and his decision to take possession of the property for administration purposes is conclusive against heirs and devisees, whom he may evict from the property.

   Title to property passes to a decedent's heirs or devisees at death, subject to a personal representative's broad powers over the title for administration purposes; a personal representative is allowed to lease and sell estate property if acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons. Therefore, although a personal representative might have been acting reasonably when she leased farmland, an income-producing asset of the estate, there was insufficient analysis or supporting evidence presented on the issue.

   All property belonging to the estate, of every kind, nature, and description, had to be accounted for in the county court of probate. Miller v. First Nat'l Bank, 62 N.D. 122, 242 N.W. 124, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 1932); Dolphin v. Peterson, 63 N.D. 792, 249 N.W. 784, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   Heirs could maintain action for possession of real estate, or for purpose of quieting title to same, against anyone except executor or administrator. Cathro v. McArthur, 30 N.D. 337, 152 N.W. 686, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1915).
      </p>
      <p>

   An heir could not maintain a suit for partition against other heirs and the administrator in district court after the county court had assumed jurisdiction to probate and administer the estate, and had appointed an administrator for that purpose, and before a final decree of distribution had been made in the county court. Honsinger v. Stewart, 34 N.D. 513, 159 N.W. 12, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>

   For purposes of administration where there had been a judgment in favor of estate in proceeding to determine adverse claims between executor and heirs at law, such judgment should have quieted title in heirs at law and in executor. Druey v. Baldwin, 41 N.D. 473, 172 N.W. 663, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D.), different results reached on reh'g, 41 N.D. 473, 182 N.W. 700, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   An administrator could maintain an action to determine adverse claims concerning the possession, interest, or title of the estate in the property involved. Magoffin v. Watros, 45 N.D. 406, 178 N.W. 134, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1920).

   A personal representative is a trustee of the estate for the benefit of creditors and heirs; as a trustee the personal representative is governed by chapter 59-01, in addition to the provisions of Title 30.1.

   Title to property passes to a decedent's heirs or devisees at death, subject to a personal representative's broad powers over the title for administration purposes; a personal representative is allowed to lease and sell estate property if acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons. Therefore, although a personal representative might have been acting reasonably when she leased farmland, an income-producing asset of the estate, there was insufficient analysis or supporting evidence presented on the issue.

       <p>

   Former section granted no jurisdiction to the county court in regard to motions to set aside decree, and was a statute of limitation applicable to actions in courts of general jurisdiction because the county court lacked equitable jurisdiction. Reichert v. Reichert, 41 N.D. 253, 170 N.W. 621, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1919); Bellingham State Bank v.

       </p>
       <p>

   Former section did not create a new remedy nor confer a new right of action, but merely recognized the existing rule that a judgment could be vacated by an equitable action upon certain grounds, and limited the time within which such action could be brought. Kranz v. Tavis, 49 N.D. 553, 192 N.W. 176, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1922).

         “Other Ground.”

   The phrase “or other ground upon which the action is based” meant any other ground which addressed itself to equity as a court of conscience. Moore v. Palmer, 43 N.D. 99, 174 N.W. 93, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 1919).

       <p>

   Equity would not grant relief for mere errors of law committed by county court, nor would it grant relief where person seeking to set aside decree could have had the matter litigated in county court if due diligence had been exercised. Kranz v. Tavis, 49 N.D. 553, 192 N.W. 176, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1922).

   Defense of statute of limitations was good as against claim of creditor who failed to file note, or copy of it, and permitted estate to be closed and administrator discharged, and equity would not reopen probate of estate.

       Persons dealing with personal representative — Protection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who in good faith either assists a personal representative or deals with the personal representative for value is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised the personal representative’s power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise. Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 30.1-16-04, no provision in any will or order of court purporting to limit the power of a personal representative is effective except as to persons with actual knowledge thereof. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a personal representative. The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged decedent is found to be alive. The protection here expressed is not in substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

   Title to property passes to a decedent's heirs or devisees at death, subject to a personal representative's broad powers over the title for administration purposes; a personal representative is allowed to lease and sell estate property if acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons. Therefore, although a personal representative might have been acting reasonably when she leased farmland, an income-producing asset of the estate, there was insufficient analysis or supporting evidence presented on the issue.

      A personal representative is entitled to reasonable compensation for the personal representative’s services.

A personal representative also may renounce the personal representative’s right to all or any part of the compensation. A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court.

       <p>

   District court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant’s request for personal representative’s fees and attorney’s fees. The district court found the litigation costs and a substantial portion of the attorney’s fees were more in pursuit of appellant’s own personal interests than the estate’s interests. Sande v. Sande (In re Estate of Sande), 2020 ND 125, 943 N.W.2d 826, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 2020).

   District court did not err in finding personal representative fees reasonable where personal representative submitted statements showing she spent many hours preparing assets for sale and negotiating sales, attending to estate obligations, and working with legal counsel. Berger v. Peterson (In re Estate of Peterson), 1997 ND 48, 561 N.W.2d 618, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Personal representative did not present any invoices, statements, cancelled checks, itemizations, or other documentation substantiating the requested fees; the children failed to meet their burden to affirmatively establish that the district court abused its discretion in determining a reasonable amount of additional personal representative’s fees and attorney’s fees.

   In re Estate of Cashmore v. Cashmore, 2010 ND 159, 787 N.W.2d 261, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>

   It was not an abuse of discretion to award a personal representative personal representative's fees because the trial court recognized (1) the extensive volume of work done by the personal representative for the estate and (2) that the actions taken by the personal representative were all done in good faith. Hogen v. Hogen (Estate of Hogen), 2015 ND 125, 863 N.W.2d 876, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the personal representative’s fees where it found the personal representative provided 392 hours of service over more than five years, based on a spreadsheet the personal representative prepared, the numbers of hours were reasonable given the nature of the matter, and it adequately explained its decision. In re Estate of Albrecht, 2020 ND 27, 938 N.W.2d 151, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 2020).

   District court stated that the wife, as personal representative of the estate, was allowed to claim her personal representative fees in a “reasonable amount;” however, the court’s decision did not otherwise provide a dollar amount of those services or explain how those personal representative’s fees were calculated, and as the court’s decision was inadequate to understand the basis for the award, a remand was necessary for a determination of the amount of personal representative fees.

        Computation of Compensation.

      </p>
      <p>

   Fact that inventory specified certain property as homestead did not exclude such property from estate of decedent for purposes of determining executor’s compensation. In re Novak's Estate, 73 N.D. 41, 11 N.W.2d 64, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>

   It was not erroneous for the court to compute the executor’s commission upon the total inventoried value of the estate, less the exempt personal property. In re Novak's Estate, 73 N.D. 41, 11 N.W.2d 64, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>

   Determination of proper fee to be paid to administrator should have been based not only upon actual money handled by him, but also on the value of the property undisposed of as originally inventoried and appraised.

         Allowance of Reasonable Attorney Fees.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   This section specifically provides that ultimate success in legal proceedings is not a prerequisite to the allowance of reasonable attorney fees. In re Estate of Flaherty, 484 N.W.2d 515, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   Award of attorney fees to a personal representative was not an abuse of discretion because, while the amount awarded was large, the court gave a reasoned explanation, including (1) consideration of the “lodestar” rate, and (2) the fact the case involved lengthy evidentiary hearings and issues related to reconstructing financial records and tracing crop-share proceeds and cash rent over several years for farmland in contentious litigation. Hogen v. Hogen (Estate of Hogen), 2015 ND 125, 863 N.W.2d 876, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court's decision approving the personal representative fees and attorney's fees was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable where many of the residuary devisees' arguments regarding the payment of fees relates to their allegation that the representative breached her fiduciary duties in selling the farmland to a grandson, the court had previously held that the representative had the power to sell the farmland, and the case had been ongoing for a long time. Mark v. Johnson (In re Estate of Johnson), 2017 ND 162, 897 N.W.2d 921, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 162</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the estate’s attorney’s fees where the Estate incurred significant attorney’s fees and costs in defending the petitions filed by the decedent’s son and the decedent’s estranged husband while the claims were pending for years. In re Estate of Albrecht, 2020 ND 27, 938 N.W.2d 151, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 2020).

   Person named as personal representative in a will was not entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs for his unsuccessful attempt to probate the will where the will was not admitted to probate because of lack of testamentary capacity of the testator, the person initiated the probate proceeding in the hope of personal gain and without any intent to benefit the estate, and the person exercised undue influence over the testator in executing the will; under such circumstances, the person was not entitled to any presumption that he offered the will for probate in good faith. In re Estate of Honerud, 326 N.W.2d 95, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 375</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   Since an attorney employed by a beneficiary usually seeks to benefit only his or her client and not the entire estate, regardless of professed motives or resulting outcome, attorney fees are disallowed. In re Estate of Rohrich, 496 N.W.2d 566, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 34</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where the personal representative attacked the trust’s creation, acting primarily to benefit his own interests, he was not entitled to collect attorney fees. First Nat'l Bank v. City of Larimore (In re Oliver), 540 N.W.2d 630, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>

   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reducing attorney’s fees by amount spent on activities that did nothing to benefit an estate or assist in an appeal. First Nat'l Bank v. City of Larimore (In re Oliver), 540 N.W.2d 630, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant’s request for personal representative’s fees and attorney’s fees. The district court found the litigation costs and a substantial portion of the attorney’s fees were more in pursuit of appellant’s own personal interests than the estate’s interests. Sande v. Sande (In re Estate of Sande), 2020 ND 125, 943 N.W.2d 826, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court’s denial of a request for a recovery of attorney’s fees by a co-personal representative who was removed from the administration of the decedent’s unsupervised estate was appropriate because the co-personal representative neither offered, nor identified any direct evidence that the decedent was either unduly influenced or susceptible to such influence as the co-personal representative claimed and the co-personal representative failed to perform any duty pertaining to the office. Binstock v. Finch (In re Estate of Finch), 2021 ND 159, 963 N.W.2d 754, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 2021).

       <p>

   In construing this section, it must appear that the personal representative acted in good faith, that his conduct was free from fraud, and that he benefited the estate before attorney fees and costs may be awarded by the court. A “benefit” to an estate certainly includes services that bring about an enhancement in value or an increase in the assets of the estate. In re Estate of Flaherty, 484 N.W.2d 515, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   A “benefit” to the estate is not to be measured solely in monetary terms, but can also include a personal representative’s good faith attempts to effectuate the testamentary intention set forth in a facially valid will. In re Estate of Flaherty, 484 N.W.2d 515, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   District court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the surviving spouse administration costs and attorney’s fees where her pursuit of an elective share from the estate was congruent with the decedent’s testamentary intent to provide for the spouse during her lifetime. Estate of Wicklund v. Wicklund, 2014 ND 64, 844 N.W.2d 565, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D. 2014).

   Even though district court did not find personal representative had acted in bad faith, court did not err in denying personal representative’s request that attorney fees be paid by the estate rather than from his personal funds where such fees were incurred in defending the validity of joint tenancies with right of survivorship between the personal representative and the deceased which defense, if successful, would have had the effect of making the joint tenancy property the property of the personal representative rather than property of the estate. Liebelt v. Saby, 279 N.W.2d 881, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1979).

   Attorney seeking compensation from personal representative of an estate must have rendered some necessary or beneficial legal services, there must be some evidence that such services were rendered, and the compensation therefor must be reasonable. In re Estate of Vertin, 381 N.W.2d 199, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>

   Even without a challenge under this section, a personal representative may pay out of the estate only reasonable attorney fees, for which there must be some basis. In re Estate of Vertin, 381 N.W.2d 199, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>

   District court did not err in ordering an attorney to repay the fees he charged in the administration of an estate because there was sufficient evidence suggesting that the fees were unreasonable; the district court did not misinterpret or misapply the law in holding the attorney personally responsible for the unreasonable fees he charged because it considered the evidence and testimony before it and determined that the fees he collected in his service to the estate were unreasonable.

     <p>
      Unless notice has already been given under this section, a personal representative upon appointment may publish a notice to creditors whose identities are not reasonably ascertainable. The notice must be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. If the personal representative elects to publish a notice to creditors then, in addition to publishing the notice to creditors, the personal representative shall mail a copy of the notice to those creditors whose identities are known to the personal representative or are reasonably ascertainable and who have not already filed a claim. The notice must announce the personal representative’s appointment and address and notify creditors of the estate to present their claims within three months after the date of the first publication or mailing of the notice or be forever barred. For the purpose of this section, a reasonably ascertainable creditor includes a creditor who regularly submits billings to the decedent or the decedent’s estate and to whose billings the personal representative has had access.

     <p>
      Unless an estate is insolvent, the personal representative, with the consent of all successors whose interests would be affected, may waive any defense of limitations available to the estate. If the defense is not waived, no claim that was barred by any statute of limitations at the time of the decedent’s death may be allowed or paid. The running of any statute of limitations measured from some other event than death and advertisement and mailing of notice for claims against a decedent is suspended during the three months following the decedent’s death but resumes thereafter as to claims not barred pursuant to the sections which follow. For purposes of any statute of limitations, the proper presentation of a claim under section 30.1-19-04 is equivalent to commencement of a proceeding on the claim.

   The exercise of the creditor’s power to petition for appointment of the personal representative is mandatory; a claimant cannot rely on the failure of other persons to seek appointment of a personal representative to suspend the running of a statute of limitations against the claimant.

   Upon the death of a person liable to suit on a tort claim for damages, the time to sue the decedent’s estate is measured from the date of the injury; that person’s death only causes a temporary suspension that extends the limitation period by three months under this section.

       Manner of presentation of claims.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Claims against a decedent’s estate may be presented as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-04ol11">
       The claimant may deliver or mail to the personal representative and any attorney of record for the estate a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed, or may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court. The claim is deemed presented on the first to occur, either receipt of the written statement of claim by the personal representative, or the filing of the claim with the court. If a claim is not yet due, the claimant shall state the date when it will become due. If the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the claimant shall state the nature of the uncertainty. If the claim is secured, the claimant shall describe the security. Failure to describe correctly the security, the nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the presentation.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-04ol12">
       The claimant may commence a proceeding against the personal representative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction, to obtain payment of the claimant’s claim against the estate, but the commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim. A presentation of claim is not required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent which were pending at the time of death.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-04ol13">
       If a claim is presented under subsection 1, a proceeding on the claim may not be commenced more than sixty days after the personal representative has mailed a notice of disallowance, but, in the case of a claim which is not presently due or which is contingent or unliquidated, the personal representative may consent to an extension of the sixty-day period, or to avoid injustice, the court, on petition, may order an extension of the sixty-day period, but in no event may the extension run beyond the applicable statute of limitations.

   Evidence of mailing a bill to the personal representative of an estate supports a finding of presentation under this section, unless outweighed by evidence that it was not received.

   County did not abuse its discretion by allowing business record evidence of presentation of funeral bill by mail, even though the business records and testimony of the funeral home may not have been as complete and painstaking as estate would have liked.

   North Dakota court should not have tried to resolve the merits of a claim relating to an award of military retirement benefits to a former wife because she was not required to submit a claim against her husband’s estate for such since an action was pending at the time of his death; moreover, if a judgment was entered against a personal representative as a substituted party in the pending California action regarding the retirement benefits, this constituted an allowance of the claim against the former husband’s estate.

        Burden of Proof When Pleading Nonclaim.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   The burden of proving the presentation and rejection of a claim against a decedent’s estate, and of a suit begun within ninety days thereof, was upon the plaintiff, whether or not the defendant had answered, pleading the statute of nonclaim. Mann v. Redmon, 27 N.D. 346, 145 N.W. 1031, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1914).

        Claim by State.

      </p>
      <p>

   Claim of state for paying old-age assistance to decedent was not objectionable for failure to attach papers on which allowance was made, since it was a claim for money. State v. Wehe, 72 N.D. 186, 5 N.W.2d 311, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1942).

      <p>

   A verified claim for care and support of decedent filed in the county court was evidence only of the fact that it was duly presented as a claim against the estate. Gange v. Gange, 79 N.D. 372, 56 N.W.2d 688, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 1953).

        Estate of Bank Shareholder.

      </p>
      <p>

   An estate of a deceased shareholder in a state bank was liable, through the executor, for an assessment on account of a superadded statutory liability where the bank failed after the death of the shareholder and claim was not filed or allowed in probate court. Baird v. McMillan, 53 N.D. 257, 205 N.W. 682, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1925).

   An administrator was entitled to credit for payment of the mortgage debt, in good faith, though the claim was not filed by the mortgagee. DANIELSON v. PRITZ, 59 N.D. 548, 231 N.W. 550, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 1930).

       </p>
       <p>

   A creditor of a decedent whose claim was secured by mortgage, pledge, or any specific lien did not need to present his claim to the administrator for allowance in order to preserve his right to subject the property covered by the lien to the satisfaction of the claim.

       <p>

   A creditor failing to file a note or copy thereof in presenting his claim against an estate, and permitting the estate to be closed and the administrator discharged, could not invoke the district court’s equitable jurisdiction to reopen the probate of the estate. People's State Bank v. Thompson, 64 N.D. 472, 253 N.W. 742, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 223</cite> (N.D. 1934).

   An heir could not maintain a suit for partition against other heirs and the administrator in district court, after the county court had assumed jurisdiction to probate and administer the estate, and had appointed an administrator for that purpose, and before a final decree of distribution had been made in the county court.

   A “contingent claim”, within former statute barring claims against an estate arising on contract, even though contingent, unless presented within the time limited in the notice, was one in which liability depended upon the occurrence of a future event which made it uncertain whether the claim would become a liability. Graber v. Bontrager, 69 N.D. 300, 285 N.W. 865, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 1939).

      In allowing a claim the personal representative may deduct any counterclaim which the estate has against the claimant. In determining a claim against an estate, a court shall reduce the amount allowed by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims exceed the claim, render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess. A counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction other than that upon which the claim is based.

   A deficit in case specifically appropriated property was insufficient to pay debts, in absence of a residuary estate, had to be spread over several devises or legacies. Black v. Black, 58 N.D. 501, 226 N.W. 485, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1929).

      If property distributed in kind or a security interest therein is acquired for value by a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who has received an instrument or deed of distribution from the personal representative, or is so acquired by a purchaser from or lender to a transferee of the distributee, the purchaser or lender takes title free of any right of an interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, or to any interested person, whether or not the distribution was proper or supported by court order or the authority of the personal representative was terminated before execution of the instrument or deed. This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who, as personal representative, has executed a deed of distribution to the personal representative, and a purchaser from or lender to any other distributee or the distributee’s transferee. To be protected under this provision, a purchaser or lender need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated before the distribution.

       Private agreements among successors to decedent binding on personal representative.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to the rights of creditors and taxing authorities, competent successors may agree among themselves to alter the interests, shares, or amounts to which they are entitled under the will of the decedent, or under the laws of intestacy, in any way that they provide in a written contract executed by all who are affected by its provisions. The personal representative shall abide by the terms of the agreement subject to the personal representative’s obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all taxes and costs of administration, and to carry out the responsibilities of the personal representative’s office for the benefit of any successors of the decedent who are not parties. Personal representatives of decedents’ estates are not required to see to the performance of trusts if the trustee thereof is another person who is willing to accept the trust. Accordingly, trustees of a testamentary trust are successors for the purposes of this section. Nothing herein relieves trustees of any duties owed to beneficiaries of trusts.

   District court did not err in apportioning the estate tax obligation in accordance with subsection (2) because a testator's boilerplate will provision directing payment of “federal and state taxes” from estate assets did not clearly and unambiguously direct a method of apportionment of estate taxes different from the method provided by statute.

   The federal estate taxes will be paid according to the apportionment method of this section unless the decedent’s will directs in clear and unambiguous language a different method of apportionment. Bushee v. Bushee, 303 N.W.2d 320, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 1981).

   Will provision directing the sale of decedent’s business properties and providing that “all of my debts, taxes, etc.; be paid in full, from revenue from such sale” did not clearly and unambiguously direct a method of apportionment of estate taxes different from the method provided by this section as the phrase “all of my … taxes” might refer to just personal or business taxes; there was no express reference in the will to estate taxes; and there was no express direction in the will against the apportionment of estate taxes.

   This section did not apply where will clearly and unambiguously expressed testator’s intent that estate taxes were to be paid in a manner different from that provided by this section. McGuire v. Gaffney, 314 N.W.2d 851, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1982).

   Group gift of what testator’s probate estate could claim as exempt under the unified credit in the Internal Revenue Code, § 2010, and deductible residual gifts to charities were designed to save federal estate taxes by combining exemptions and deductions in federal estate tax law, and testator’s intent to pay necessary estate taxes was not inconsistent with an intent to minimize estate taxes.

   Probate proceedings in the county court were limited to an administration that would result in payment of indebtedness and the ultimate distribution of residue, and did not extend to the determination of escheats.

        North Dakota had no special statute providing for the issuance of an execution to enforce a final decree of distribution; enforcement of such a decree was provided for by former N.D.C.C. § 30-21-10 dealing with the decree of distribution. 136 N.W.2d 455.

   In suit by decedent’s son to enforce option to purchase interest in realty pursuant to provision in will granting such option, county court had jurisdiction to enter final decree as to who was entitled to estate, and also had duty to determine what proportion or part of estate each person was entitled to receive; accordingly, court had jurisdiction to determine validity of option.

      A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition for an order of settlement of the estate which will not adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent.

      A compromise of any controversy as to admission to probate of any instrument offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction, validity, or effect of any governing instrument, the rights or interests in the estate of the decedent, of any successor, or the administration of the estate, if approved in a formal proceeding in the court for that purpose, is binding on all the parties thereto, including those unborn, unascertained, or who could not be located. An approved compromise is binding even though it may affect a trust or an inalienable interest. A compromise does not impair the rights of creditors or of taxing authorities who are not parties to it.

   In a trust dispute, a petition was a good faith challenge to the capacity to create a trust where the settlor was affected by alcoholism, and it was necessary to avoid further litigation and protect the interests of the beneficiaries. Moreover, a life estate holder did not have to sign the agreement because the settlement agreement pertained to distributions to residuary beneficiaries after the expiration of the life estate.

       The terms of the compromise shall be set forth in an agreement in writing which shall be executed by all competent persons and parents or guardians acting for any minor children having beneficial interests or having claims which will or may be affected by the compromise. Execution is not required by any person whose identity cannot be ascertained or whose whereabouts is unknown and cannot reasonably be ascertained.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-22s30.1-22-02ol12">
       Any interested person, including the personal representative, if any, or a trustee, then may submit the agreement to the court for its approval and for execution by the personal representative, the trustee of every affected testamentary trust, and other fiduciaries and representatives.

      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-22s30.1-22-02ol13">
       After notice to all interested persons or their representatives, including the personal representative of any estate and all affected trustees, the court, if it finds that the contest or controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the agreement upon the interests of persons represented by fiduciaries or other representatives is just and reasonable, shall make an order approving the agreement and directing all fiduciaries under its supervision to execute the agreement. Minor children represented only by their parents or guardians may be bound only if their parents or guardians join with other competent persons in execution of the compromise. Upon the making of the order and the execution of the agreement, all further disposition of the estate is in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

The person is not required to see to the application of the personal property or evidence thereof or to inquire into the truth of any statement in the affidavit. If any person to whom an affidavit is delivered refuses to pay, deliver, transfer, or issue any personal property or evidence thereof, it may be recovered or its payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance compelled upon proof of their right in a proceeding brought for the purpose by or on behalf of the persons entitled thereto. Any person to whom payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance is made is answerable and accountable therefor to any personal representative of the estate or to any other person having a superior right.

      The power of a domiciliary foreign personal representative under section 30.1-24-02 or 30.1-24-06 shall be exercised only if there is no administration or application therefor pending in this state. An application or petition for local administration of the estate terminates the power of the foreign personal representative to act under section 30.1-24-06, but the local court may allow the foreign personal representative to exercise limited powers to preserve the estate. No person who, before receiving actual notice of a pending local administration, has changed that person’s position in reliance upon the powers of a foreign personal representative shall be prejudiced by reason of the application or petition for, or grant of, local administration. The local personal representative is subject to all duties and obligations which have accrued by virtue of the exercise of the powers by the foreign personal representative and may be substituted for the foreign personal representative in any action or proceedings in this state.

       (5-202) Testamentary appointment of guardian of minor.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The parent of a minor may appoint by will a guardian of an unmarried minor. A testamentary appointment becomes effective upon filing the guardian’s acceptance in the court in which the will is probated and remains effective upon approval by the court either after or without a hearing, if, before acceptance, both parents are dead or the surviving parent’s rights have been terminated by prior court order. If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority. This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing the guardian’s acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the testator’s domicile and upon approval by the court either after or without a hearing. Upon acceptance of appointment, written notice of acceptance must be given by the guardian to the minor and to the person having the minor’s care or to the minor’s nearest adult relative under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.27.html#t27c27-20.3s27-20.3-02" target="_blank">27-20.3-02</a></cite>. Within forty-five days of the filing of acceptance, the testamentary guardian must file with the court a criminal history record check report and affidavit stating whether the proposed guardian has been investigated for offenses related to theft, fraud, or the abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an adult or child and shall provide a release authorizing access to any record information maintained by an agency in this or another state or a federal agency.

        Best Interests of Child.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   In awarding the custody of a minor or appointing a general guardian, the court was to be guided by the best interests of the child in respect to its temporal, moral, or mental welfare. Flath v. Nelson, 53 N.D. 603, 207 N.W. 444, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>

   In the awarding of the custody and the appointing of guardians of children, the determining consideration was the welfare of the child. Rufer v. Rufer, 67 N.D. 67, 269 N.W. 741, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 1936); Sjol v. Sjol, 76 N.D. 336, 35 N.W.2d 797, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>

   An eleven-year-old daughter was permitted to remain in the home of her maternal grandmother in which she had been cared for from early infancy since the welfare of the child outweighed the legal rights of the father. Borg v. Anderson, 73 N.D. 95, 11 N.W.2d 121, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>

   A parent was entitled to the custody of his child unless the evidence showed that the best interests of the child would not be served by awarding him custody. In re Custody of Wagner, 84 N.W.2d 587, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>

   In habeas corpus proceeding by father to obtain custody of nine-year-old daughter it was determined that the welfare of the child, who had been in the care and custody of the respondents almost since her birth, and treated as their own child, would be best served by permitting her to remain with the respondents. In re Custody of Wagner, 84 N.W.2d 587, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>

   The statutory right of the parent to primary consideration in the matter of custody was subject to a determination of what was best for the child, such best interests of the child being paramount. McKay v. Mitzel, 137 N.W.2d 792, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>

   The best interests of children were served by giving them to persons, who had had custody of children since their parents had been killed in auto accident, operated a 1,185 acre farm, made twelve thousand dollars per year, had four children with outstanding records, took the children to church and Sunday school every Sunday even though they might be more strict than other persons who had first petitioned for the children, who had four children of their own, who lived in trailer which was encumbered, made eight thousand dollars a year, were Lutherans but did not belong to or attend any church, and whose only character witness was owner and operator of a bar. In re Adoption of Godejohn, 190 N.W.2d 42, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>

   The statutory preference set forth in statute on rules for awarding custody was dependent upon a finding that an award of custody to either the mother or the father of a child of tender years would be in the best interests of the child. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 202 N.W.2d 760, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 98</cite> (N.D. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Capacity of Child to Choose.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   There was no exact age which gave child capacity to make choice as to custody within purview of statute on rules for awarding custody; phrase “other things being equal” gave court large measure of discretion to determine how best interests of child would be served and awarding custody of minor child to natural father was not an abuse of discretion under circumstances. Guldeman v. Heller, 151 N.W.2d 436, 1967 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Child of Tender Years.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   In custody proceedings neither parent is entitled to custody as of right, but other things being equal, if the child is of tender years, it should be given to the mother. Silseth v. Levang, 214 N.W.2d 361, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1974).

        Custody to Mother.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Upon the death of a father to whom was awarded the custody of a child in a divorce suit, the mother could be given custody in a habeas corpus proceeding, upon a showing that she was a proper person. Garrett v. Burbage, 55 N.D. 926, 215 N.W. 479, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 1927).

        Custody to Third Party.

      <p>

   Custody could be awarded to a third party when the morals or safety or interests of the child demanded it. Sjol v. Sjol, 76 N.D. 336, 35 N.W.2d 797, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1949).

   Mother who admitted committing adultery on one occasion but who was otherwise a good mother was awarded custody of her three and five-year-old daughters. Ficek v. Ficek, 186 N.W.2d 437, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1971).

   Under North Dakota’s guardianship of minors’

   law, a trial court must determine whether the welfare and best interest of the minor will be served by the appointment of the guardian. Likewise, the termination of a guardianship must be based on the ground that removal will be in the best interest of the minor; the guardianship of minors’

   law applies to both voluntarily established and involuntarily established guardianships, and determining the best interest of the minor does not necessarily require a finding that the parent is unfit.

   Barros v. Smestad (In re Barros), 2005 ND 122, 701 N.W.2d 402, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 2005), overruled in part, State v. G.L. (In re G.L.), 2018 ND 176, 915 N.W.2d 685, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       </h5>
       <p>

   In the context of a parent’s action to terminate a voluntarily-established guardianship of a minor, a natural parent must initially prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the impediments leading to the creation of the guardianship are removed. A nonparent seeking custody then has the burden of rebutting the presumption that it is in the best interests of the child to be in the custody of the parent; the presumption can be overcome when there exist “exceptional circumstances.”

       A parent had no authority over the property of his child without appointment as guardian of the child’s estate as provided by law. State v. Johnson, 88 N.W.2d 209 (N.D. 1958), overruled on other grounds, State v. Allen, 237 N.W.2d 154 (N.D. 1975), decided prior to the adoption of N.D.R.Crim.P. 29.

   Where general guardian and ward were represented by attorneys who defended quiet title suit brought against them and no special guardian was appointed to represent ward in legal proceedings, fact that court having jurisdiction over guardianship never gave consent that action be defended did not affect legality of proceedings.

   A guardian, if he invested the ward’s funds pursuant to the order or direction of the county court, was relieved of personal liability. KILBY v. BURNHAM, 65 N.D. 169, 256 N.W. 522, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 1934).

   Because a petitioner for removal of existing guardians failed to demonstrate that additional fees were authorized by statute or by the parties’ agreement, a district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award additional attorney’s fees to her, and because there was statutory support for paying attorney’s fees of guardians and conservators under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-03" target="_self">30.1-28-03</a></cite>(9), <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-24" target="_self">30.1-29-24</a></cite>(3)(w), (x) and the petitioner failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees to the guardians and conservator, the district court’s fee awards were affirmed.

   Guardianship or conservatorship contemplates a legal proceeding in which the ward has had his or her authority withdrawn by a court order; no guardianship or conservatorship existed that withdrew the attorney's client's authority to act for himself.

   In a guardianship case, a guardian ad litem fulfilled her duties under this statute when she stated that a guardianship was in the ward's best interest because she was not required to be the ward's advocate; the ward contended that the guardian should have advocated her wish to remain in her home and not have a guardian appointed. There was no indication that the guardian ad litem was retained as the ward's advocate. N.P. v. M.E. (In re M.E.), 2015 ND 267, 871 N.W.2d 435, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   In a guardianship case, a ward's statutory rights were not violated because a district court substantially complied with this statute by accepting a physician's letter as the required physician's report. Even though an appointed expert refused to evaluate the ward, this letter provided a medical evaluation to the court satisfying the statutory requirements, and there was liberal construction of this title.

   Where a guardian of an estate of an incompetent person had been appointed by the county court of his residence, the district court in an action against such incompetent person had no authority to appoint a guardian ad litem for such incompetent person.

   Where a person of lawful age personally appeared without being cited at a hearing called by a county judge on petition for a guardian’s appointment, and stated that she wished to have a person appointed as guardian, and signed a written request for his appointment, the court acquired jurisdiction over her person to the same extent as if she had been cited.

   To balance the competing interests of protection and liberty in guardianship situations, trial courts are expected to use a clear and convincing evidentiary standard, while appellate review under N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) uses a more probing “clearly erroneous” standard.

         Burden of Proof
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Supreme Court of North Dakota concludes that the party proposing the transfer of a ward to a more restrictive living arrangement has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed placement is the least restrictive alternative available. This allocation of the burden of proof is in accord with the current trend of courts and legislatures to enhance the protections available to persons alleged to be incapable of caring for themselves or their property.

   In a guardianship case, since a ward could not remember being exploited financially and was unable to drive, it was not error to deprive her of the right to marry or obtain a driver's license. However, the court erred in depriving the ward of the right to testify in judicial or administrative proceedings without a specific finding. N.P. v. M.E.

   In a guardianship case, a court's findings regarding the ward's incapacity, the necessity of the guardianship, and the authority given to the co-guardians and the co-conservators were not clearly erroneous; the ward could not remember being exploited financially, she had overdosed on medication, she had fallen in her home several times, and she posed a fire danger due to smoking in her home.

   Read together, the definitions of “mental deficiency” and “incapacity” require an incapacity that endangers the person’s welfare. In re Guardianship of Braaten, 502 N.W.2d 512, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1993).

   Although the trial court properly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that a person was incapacitated for purposes of medical decisionmaking, its finding of complete incapacity was not supported by convincing evidence, and was clearly erroneous. In re Guardianship of Braaten, 502 N.W.2d 512, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Trial court did not err in finding that a ward’s placement in a locked, dementia unit of a nursing home was the least restrictive alternative for his residence because his Alzheimer’s disease had been re-evaluated as “severe” and he had already wandered from his home, foster care would have to have been provided in a locked setting and would likely have been provided by people who did not have the training and experience of the people at the nursing home, and the ward was provided with a security net but also had an ability to be out of the facility and to have meaningful contacts.

   Van Sickle v. Van Sickle (In re Guardianship of Van Sickle), 2005 ND 69, 694 N.W.2d 212, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>

   There was no violation of this statute in the appointment of a guardian because, regardless of who was appointed, a physician testified that the ward required constant supervision, whether through home care or at an assisted living facility.

   Given a trial court’s erroneous findings about the extent of a person’s incapacity and about the availability of an alternative resource plan, an unlimited general guardianship was not “the least restrictive form of intervention.” In re Guardianship of Braaten, 502 N.W.2d 512, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       Termination of guardianship.

     <p>
      The authority and responsibility of a guardian for an incapacitated person terminates upon the death of the guardian or ward, except, the guardian may arrange for a deceased ward’s final disposition and refer the ward’s estate to probate, if no other person is available to perform those acts, the determination of incapacity of the guardian, or upon removal or resignation as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-07" target="_self">30.1-28-07</a></cite>. Testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding. Termination does not affect the guardian’s liability for prior acts nor the guardian’s obligation to account for funds and assets of the ward.

   District court did not err in denying a ward's petition to be restored to capacity because the ward failed to establish a prima facie case for restoration to capacity; a psychologist's notes and a visitor's report were not sufficient to establish a prima facie case for termination of the guardianship, and the ward failed to present any further evidence. M.E. v. M.E., 2017 ND 121, 894 N.W.2d 877, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>

   Ultimate burden to prove the need for a guardianship remains with the party petitioning for guardianship, or on the guardian if a guardianship has been established; the statute does not limit how often a ward may petition for termination of the guardianship, and it, therefore, is appropriate that the ward make a prima facie showing she no longer is incapacitated before the burden shifts to the guardian to prove the ward remains incapacitated and the guardianship continue. M.E. v. M.E., 2017 ND 121, 894 N.W.2d 877, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2017).

   Where a guardian had been appointed for an incompetent in this state, a judgment of a court in another state of which she subsequently became a resident, determining her competent, was not conclusive in a proceeding to have her adjudged restored to competency.

However, if no one else can be found to serve as guardian, an employee of an agency, institution, or nonprofit group home providing care and custody may be appointed guardian if the employee does not provide direct care to the proposed ward and the court makes a specific finding that the appointment presents no substantial risk of a conflict of interest.

   District court did not abuse its discretion in appointing nephew as his aunt’s guardian and conservator under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-11" target="_self">30.1-28-11</a></cite>(4), <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-10" target="_self">30.1-29-10</a></cite>(4) because it found that the nephew had no ownership or beneficiary interest in his aunt’s estate, would not accept any of her assets, and would waive his right to compensation if appointed. The aunt’s friend was willing to waive his right to compensation as guardian and conservator but was not willing to waive his right to take under the estate.

   Kolrud v. Thomas (In re Thomas), 2006 ND 219, 723 N.W.2d 384, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>

   Niece and a non-profit organization were properly appointed as co-guardians of a ward who suffered from Alzheimer's disease and dementia because this statute did not require the district court to make a specific finding that a person was of insufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice regarding appointing a guardian; there was no abuse of discretion in determining that the niece with equal priority to other relatives and the organization as the co-guardian were best qualified to serve. The district court was not of the opinion that the ward acted with or had sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice in this regard; the ward could not remember why she distrusted the niece and preferred other family members. J.W. v. B.K.J. (In re Guardianship of the Pers. &amp; Conservatorship of the Estate of B.K.J.), 2015 ND 191, 867 N.W.2d 345, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 206</cite> (N.D. 2015).

       <p>

   District court did not err in not appointing a nephew as the conservator and guardian of his uncle because, while the court's written findings did not explain its reasons, the oral findings were adequate to understand that family conflict was the reason for the court's finding of good cause not to appoint the nephew as conservator and guardian. C.G. v. K.P. (In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of R.G.), 2016 ND 96, 879 N.W.2d 416, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 2016).

   Trial court erred in denying a guardian’s request for compensation for services; the plain and ordinary meaning of the language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-12" target="_self">30.1-28-12</a></cite>(10) indicated the legislature intended to give a district court the discretion to consider what compensation was reasonable under the circumstances of any given guardianship, but the statutory language did not permit the district court to completely and preemptively reject a guardian’s request for compensation if such a request was reasonable.

   Patient or his estate was properly ordered to pay expenses arising from the appointment of a guardian/conservator because the guardian/conservator was entitled to reasonable compensation for services under N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-12" target="_self">30.1-28-12</a></cite> and N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-14" target="_self">30.1-29-14</a></cite>. The trial court had the discretion to determine the amount of reasonable compensation, the record did not show that the trial court misapplied the law in ordering the payment of expenses, and the trial court’s decision was not arbitrary, unconscionable, or unreasonable.

   Trial court did not err in finding that a ward’s placement in a locked, dementia unit of a nursing home was the least restrictive alternative for his residence because his Alzheimer’s disease had been re-evaluated as “severe” and he had already wandered from his home, foster care would have to have been provided in a locked setting and would likely have been provided by people who did not have the training and experience of the people at the nursing home, and the ward was provided with a security net but also had an ability to be out of the facility and to have meaningful contacts.

       <p>

   Supreme Court of North Dakota concludes that the party proposing the transfer of a ward to a more restrictive living arrangement has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed placement is the least restrictive alternative available. This allocation of the burden of proof is in accord with the current trend of courts and legislatures to enhance the protections available to persons alleged to be incapable of caring for themselves or their property.

   Prior authorization by court was not necessary in order to entitle a guardian to be compensated for funds which he had expended, or for obligations assumed for benefit of ward in proper and necessary management of the estate.

   Where guardian incurred liability or expended moneys without previous court order authorizing them, he faced the hazard that court might not authorize the expenditure to be charged against assets of estate.

   Appointment of a neutral conservator with limitations was proper for an elderly protected person with a large estate, cognitive decline, developing dementia, and two daughters in disagreement about the management of the estate; further, the daughter who initiated the conservatorship proceeding in good faith was properly awarded attorney fees from the estate.

   Guardianship or conservatorship contemplates a legal proceeding in which the ward has had his or her authority withdrawn by a court order; no guardianship or conservatorship existed that withdrew the attorney's client's authority to act for himself.

         Court's Findings.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial court did not make a mistake in finding that the 87-year-old respondent was incapacitated as a result of her advanced age and physical and medical problems, resulting in an inability to manage her property and that she had substantial property necessitating the appointment of a conservator for the preservation of the property and its proper application. The trial court’s findings were, therefore, not clearly erroneous, and the trial court did not err in appointing a conservator. In re Conservatorship of Gessler, 419 N.W.2d 541, 1988 N.D. App. LEXIS 1 (N.D. Ct. App. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court had personal jurisdiction over a father and did not clearly err in finding clear and convincing evidence supported the appointment of a conservator because the father properly received notice of the proceeding, rejected his children's attempts to assist him manage his affairs, his cognition and reasoning after his stroke were not what they had been before, and he made uncharacteristic gifts that showed a likelihood to dissipate assets. C.C. v. J.G.S. (In re Guardianship &amp; Conservatorship of J.G.S.), 2014 ND 239, 857 N.W.2d 847, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 243</cite> (N.D. 2014).

   In view of evidence that an individual’s financial affairs were currently in order and partially controlled through her living arrangement with a vocational adjustment workshop, the trial court erred in imposing a full and general conservatorship.

   Where questionable circumstances surrounded charitable organizations in estate plan, the trial court could not be faulted for approving a legal form for the charitable foundation that imposed a higher, fiduciary role upon management.

   In view of evidence that an individual’s financial affairs were currently in order and partially controlled through her living arrangement with a vocational adjustment workshop, the trial court erred in imposing a full and general conservatorship. In re Guardianship of Braaten, 502 N.W.2d 512, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1993).

   This section gives the supervising court and the conservator similar authority regarding a protected person’s real property. In re Conservatorship of Kinney, 495 N.W.2d 69, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>

   Trial court’s formal order stating “(Testator) shall redraft any recently executed last will and testament” did not invalidate a subsequent will or violate subsection (2)(c) given that the will was in writing, was signed by the testator, and was signed by two witnesses. Furthermore, the attorney who prepared the will did so as the testator’s attorney in accordance with testator’s stated wishes with an independent attorney serving as an impartial observer over testator’s execution of the will, and no evidence existed that the court, testator’s attorney, or the independent attorney forced testator to sign the subsequent will. Bartusch v. Hager (In re Estate of Dion), 2001 ND 53, 623 N.W.2d 720, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 2001).

   A court and conservator are not empowered to effectively defeat a protected person’s estate plan and intentions set forth in a valid will through the creation of a revocable living trust that depletes the estate that would have otherwise passed to intended beneficiaries. Oliver v. Braaten (In re Sickles), 518 N.W.2d 673, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 1994).

   Appointment of a neutral conservator with limitations was proper for an elderly protected person with a large estate, cognitive decline, developing dementia, and two daughters in disagreement about the management of the estate; further, the daughter who initiated the conservatorship proceeding in good faith was properly awarded attorney fees from the estate.

   E.P. v. T.K. (In re Conservatorship of T.K.), 2009 ND 195, 775 N.W.2d 496, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 205</cite> (N.D. 2009).

   District court erred in authorizing a limited conservator to assign a father's potential legal claims because it was not clear whether the district court authorized the conservator to assign the legal claims or whether it authorized the conservator to delegate its power to investigate and pursue the claims; it was also not clear what the district court meant by the language stating that the claims were assigned to the children in “equal shares.” P.M. v. V.A.M. (In re Estate

   A trial court’s findings concerning competency are questions of fact which will not be overturned on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. In re Bo, 365 N.W.2d 847, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 286</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   Because a supervising court and a conservator have similar discretionary authority regarding a protected person’s estate, and a supervising court’s decision regarding that property is reviewable under an abuse of discretion standard, a county court’s decision authorizing a conservator to sell a protected person’s homestead was reviewed under that standard. In re Conservatorship of Kinney, 495 N.W.2d 69, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1993).

   District court did not abuse its discretion in appointing nephew as his aunt’s guardian and conservator under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-11" target="_self">30.1-28-11</a></cite>(4), <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-10" target="_self">30.1-29-10</a></cite>(4) because it found that the nephew had no ownership or beneficiary interest in his aunt’s estate, would not accept any of her assets, and would waive his right to compensation if appointed. The aunt’s friend was willing to waive his right to compensation as guardian and conservator but was not willing to waive his right to take under the estate.

   Where an elderly protected person had a large estate, cognitive decline, developing dementia, and two daughters in disagreement about the management of the estate, there was good cause to appoint a neutral conservator with limitations rather than the caretaker daughter who was the most recent nomination in the protected person’s durable power of attorney because that daughter did not have the financial qualifications to manage the estate.

   Patient or his estate was properly ordered to pay expenses arising from the appointment of a guardian/conservator because the guardian/conservator was entitled to reasonable compensation for services under N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-12" target="_self">30.1-28-12</a></cite> and N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-14" target="_self">30.1-29-14</a></cite>.

       Conservators — Title by appointment.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The appointment of a conservator vests in the conservator title as trustee to all property of the protected person, presently held or thereafter acquired, including title to any property theretofore held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys in fact, or to the part thereof specified in the order. An order specifying that only a part of the property of the protected person vests in the conservator creates a limited conservatorship. The appointment of a conservator is not a transfer or alienation within the meaning of general provisions of any federal or state statute or regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will, or trust instrument imposing restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by the protected person of the protected person’s rights or interest, but this section does not restrict the ability of persons to make specific provision by contract or dispositive instrument relating to a conservator.

       Recording of conservator’s letters.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of all assets, or the part thereof specified in the letters, of a protected person to the conservator. An order terminating a conservatorship is evidence of transfer of all assets of the estate subjected to the conservatorship from the conservator to the protected person or the protected person’s successors. Subject to the requirements of general statutes governing the filing or recordation of documents of title to land or other property, letters of conservatorship, and orders terminating conservatorships, may be filed or recorded to give record notice of title as between the conservator and the protected person.

       Persons dealing with conservators — Protection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with the conservator for value in any transaction other than those requiring a court order as provided in section 30.1-29-08 is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 30.1-29-26 are effective as to third persons. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator. The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters. The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

   Because a petitioner for removal of existing guardians failed to demonstrate that additional fees were authorized by statute or by the parties’ agreement, a district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award additional attorney’s fees to her, and because there was statutory support for paying attorney’s fees of guardians and conservators under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-03" target="_self">30.1-28-03</a></cite>(9), <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-24" target="_self">30.1-29-24</a></cite>(3)(w), (x) and the petitioner failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees to the guardians and conservator, the district court’s fee awards were affirmed.

   Decision denying a claim to an estate was reversed because, although a conservator had broad discretion to act on behalf of a decedent, the record did not show if money stolen from a certificate of deposit (COD) that was in a payable on death account was put in a guardianship account after it was returned due to necessity and insufficient alternative funds under

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aVIc30.1-31.01s30.1-31-12" target="_self">30.1-31-12</a></cite>; also, several beneficiaries had no present interest in the COD as a payable on death account. Moreover, there was nothing to show whether a conservator was aware that the money had been in payable on death account as part of an estate plan or whether the conservator even knew that he had the power to return the funds to the pre-theft state.

   Thus, remand was necessary for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the conservator properly exercised its powers under N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-29. Allmaras v. Manly (In re Estate of Allmaras), 2007 ND 130, 737 N.W.2d 612, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person and the protected person’s dependents in accordance with the following principles:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11a">
         The conservator is to consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard of support, education, and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any. The conservator may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually furnishing support, education, or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless the conservator knows that the parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any personal duty of support, or unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of the protected person.

        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11b">
         The conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person with due regard to:
         <ol>
          <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11b1">
           The size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship, and the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage the protected person’s affairs and the estate which has been conserved for the protected person.
          </li>
          <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11b2">
           The accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of the protected person’s household.

        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11c">
         The conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person’s household, who are unable to support themselves, and who are in need of support.
        </li>
        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11d">
         Funds expended under this subsection may be paid by the conservator to any person, including the protected person, to reimburse for expenditures that the conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is reasonable to expect that they will be performed and advance payments are customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.
        </li>

       If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions authorized by the preceding subsection, a conservator for a protected person other than a minor has power to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might have been expected to make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year twenty percent of the income from the estate.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol13">
       When a minor who has not been adjudged disabled under subsection 2 of section 30.1-29-01 attains majority, the minor’s conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol14">
       When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person’s disability other than minority has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol15">
       If a protected person dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person which may have come into the conservator’s possession, inform the executor or a beneficiary named therein that the conservator has done so, and retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the decedent or other persons entitled thereto. If after forty days from the death of the protected person no other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative so that the conservator may proceed to administer and distribute the decedent’s estate without additional or further appointment. Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a conservator, after notice to any person demanding notice under section 30.1-13-04 and to any person nominated executor in any will of which the applicant is aware, the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection, and endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative. The making and entry of an order under this section shall have the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as provided in section 30.1-14-08 and chapters 30.1-17 through 30.1-21, except that estate in the name of the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent’s successors without prior retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.

   Where a county court’s decision to allow the conservator of an estate to sell the protected person’s automobile, homestead, and household goods was the product of a rational mental process by which the facts in the record and the applicable law were considered together to achieve a reasoned and reasonable determination, the court did not abuse its discretion.

   In dealing with a protected person’s estate, the preservation of a known estate plan is a permissible consideration for a conservator and a supervising court. In re Conservatorship of Kinney, 495 N.W.2d 69, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>

   Decision denying a claim to an estate was reversed because, although a conservator had broad discretion to act on behalf of a decedent, the record did not show if money stolen from a certificate of deposit (COD) that was in a payable upon death account was put in a guardianship account after it was returned due to necessity and insufficient alternative funds under

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aVIc30.1-31.01s30.1-31-12" target="_self">30.1-31-12</a></cite>; also, several beneficiaries had no present interest in the COD as a payable on death account. Moreover, there was nothing to show whether a conservator was aware that the money had been in payable on death account as part of an estate plan or whether the conservator even knew that he had the power to return the funds to the pre-theft state. Thus, remand was necessary for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the conservator properly exercised its powers under N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1–29. Allmaras v. Manly (In re Estate of Allmaras), 2007 ND 130, 737 N.W.2d 612, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2007).

   The rules relating to disbursement of a minor’s personal injury judgment create a two-prong test that the lower court must apply. First, the court must determine whether it is necessary to invade the award. If so, the court may, in its discretion, expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person. Because the allocation of funds is related solely to the benefit of the child, the award does not transform into community property. Dahner v. Daner, 374 N.W.2d 604, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   Decision denying a claim to an estate was reversed because, although a conservator had broad discretion to act on behalf of a decedent, the record did not show if money stolen from a certificate of deposit (COD) that was in a payable on death account was put in a guardianship account after it was returned due to necessity and insufficient alternative funds under

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aVIc30.1-31.01s30.1-31-12" target="_self">30.1-31-12</a></cite>; also, several beneficiaries had no present interest in the COD as a payable on death account. Moreover, there was nothing to show whether a conservator was aware that the money had been in payable on death account as part of an estate plan or whether the conservator even knew that he had the power to return the funds to the pre-theft state.

   Thus, remand was necessary for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the conservator properly exercised its powers under N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-29. Allmaras v. Manly (In re Estate of Allmaras), 2007 ND 130, 737 N.W.2d 612, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2007).

   Where a county court’s decision to allow the conservator of an estate to sell the protected person’s automobile, homestead, and household goods was the product of a rational mental process by which the facts in the record and the applicable law were considered together to achieve a reasoned and reasonable determination, the court did not abuse its discretion.

       A conservator must pay from the estate all just claims against the estate and against the protected person arising before or after the conservatorship upon their presentation and allowance. A claim may be presented by either of the following methods:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-28ol11a">
         The claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed.

        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-28ol11b">
         The claimant may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court and deliver or mail a copy of the statement to the conservator.

      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-28ol12">
       A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of the claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable statute of limitation, and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance and payment from the estate. If a proceeding is pending against a protected person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected person thereafter, the moving party must give notice of the proceeding to the conservator if the outcome is to constitute a claim against the estate.

       If it appears that the estate in conservatorship is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference is to be given to prior claims for the care, maintenance, and education of the protected person or the protected person’s dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A claim is deemed presented on the first to occur of either receipt of the written statement of claim by the conservator, or the filing of the claim with the court. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement mailed by the conservator to the claimant within sixty days after its presentation. The presentation of a claim tolls any statute of limitation relating to the claim until thirty days after its disallowance.

      The protected person, the protected person’s personal representative, the conservator, or any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the conservatorship. A protected person seeking termination is entitled to the same rights and procedures as in an original proceeding for a protective order. The court, upon determining, after notice and hearing, that the minority or disability of the protected person has ceased, may terminate the conservatorship. Upon termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the former protected person or to the protected person’s successors subject to provision in the order for expenses of administration or to conveyances from the conservator to the former protected person or the former protected person’s successors to evidence the transfer.

      A durable power of attorney is a power of attorney by which a principal designates another as the principal’s attorney in fact in writing and the writing contains the words “This power of attorney is not affected by subsequent disability or incapacity of the principal or by lapse of time,” or “This power of attorney becomes effective upon the disability or incapacity of the principal,” or similar words showing the intent of the principal that the authority conferred is exercisable notwithstanding the principal’s subsequent disability or incapacity, and, unless it states a time of termination, notwithstanding the lapse of time since the execution of the instrument.

   Grantor’s power of attorney was a durable power of attorney because the document’s specific language provided that the powers granted to the named agents were not affected by the grantor’s becoming disabled, incompetent, or incapacitated or the lapse of time. The power of attorney stated it was the grantor’s intent that the authority conferred would be exercisable notwithstanding physical disability or mental incompetence.

      As to acts undertaken in good faith reliance thereon, an affidavit executed by the attorney in fact under a power of attorney, durable or otherwise, stating that the attorney in fact did not have at the time of exercise of the power actual knowledge of the termination of the power by revocation or of the principal’s death, disability, or incapacity is conclusive proof of the nonrevocation or nontermination of the power at that time. If the exercise of the power of attorney requires execution and delivery of any instrument that is recordable, the affidavit when authenticated for record is likewise recordable. This section does not affect any provision in a power of attorney for its termination by expiration of time or occurrence of an event other than express revocation or a change in the principal’s capacity.

      If any power of attorney, durable or otherwise, or other writing authorizes an attorney in fact or other agent to perform any act that the principal might or could do or evidences the principal’s intent to give the attorney in fact or agent full power to handle the principal’s affairs or deal with the principal’s property, the attorney in fact or agent may make gifts. The gifts may be in any amount of any of the principal’s property to any individual or to an organization described in sections 170(c) and 2522(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or corresponding future provisions of federal tax law, or both. Notwithstanding this section, a principal, by express words in the power of attorney or other writing, may authorize, or limit the authority of, any attorney in fact or other agent to make gifts of the principal’s property. This section applies to a power of attorney executed before August 1, 1995, as well as a power of attorney executed after July 31, 1995.

        As
        N.D.C.C. § 47-11-07 is a general provision dealing with all oral gifts, while this chapter contains specific provisions governing joint accounts and disposition of funds remaining on deposit at death, any conflict between
        N.D.C.C. § 47-11-07 and N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-31 would be resolved in favor of the latter. In re Conservatorship of Milbrath, 508 N.W.2d 360 (N.D. 1993).

   District court properly dismissed a son’s complaint against his brother—for contempt of court and unjust enrichment—with prejudice because, while the son appeared to claim an interest in their deceased mother’s investment account as a beneficiary, he lacked standing where he never had a vested interest in the investment account, the summons and interim order were not entered for his protection, and, even assuming that he suffered some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action, he was not asserting his own legal rights and interests, but rather his claims rested on the legal rights and interests of his father in the parents’ divorce action.

       Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, on death of a party sums on deposit in a multiple-party account belong to the surviving party or parties. If two or more parties survive and one is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under section 30.1-31-08 belongs to the surviving spouse. If two or more parties survive and none is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under section 30.1-31-08 belongs to the surviving parties in equal shares, and augments the proportion to which each survivor, immediately before the decedent’s death, was beneficially entitled under section 30.1-31-08, and the right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties.

A P.O.D. designation in a multiple-party account without right of survivorship is ineffective. For purposes of this section, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the account is without right of survivorship.

   Decision denying a claim to an estate was reversed because, although a conservator had broad discretion to act on behalf of a decedent, the record did not show if money stolen from a certificate of deposit (COD) that was in a payable on death account was put in a guardianship account after it was returned due to necessity and insufficient alternative funds under

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t30.1aVIc30.1-31.01s30.1-31-12" target="_self">30.1-31-12</a></cite>; also, several beneficiaries had no present interest in the COD as a payable on death account. Moreover, there was nothing to show whether a conservator was aware that the money had been in payable on death account as part of an estate plan or whether the conservator even knew that he had the power to return the funds to the pre-theft state.

   Thus, remand was necessary for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the conservator properly exercised its powers under N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-29. Allmaras v. Manly (In re Estate of Allmaras), 2007 ND 130, 737 N.W.2d 612, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       Ownership on death of owner.

     <p>
      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

       A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests for registrations in beneficiary form and for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered T.O.D. beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary’s descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary’s death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters L.D.P.S., standing for “lineal descendants per stirpes”. This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary’s descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary’s domicile at the owner’s death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity’s terms and conditions.

   Prior discretionary application of old probate procedures did not fix procedural rights for the eternity of the probated estates. It is axiomatic that procedural modes, as distinguished, from substantive rights, are not vested and are subject to repeal, modification or change.

       <p>

   Before the Uniform Probate Code provisions apply to a will executed before the effective date of such code, the will must have been validly executed; such validity is determined by the law that existed at the time of the will’s execution. In re Estate of Thomas, 290 N.W.2d 223, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 196</cite> (N.D. 1980).
