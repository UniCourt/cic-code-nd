       Former employee’s claim of tortious interference with an employment contract under N.D.C.C. §§ 34-01-04 and 34-01-06 against her former employer and its CEO was dismissed because neither of the statutory provisions created a private cause of action and both statutes were criminal in nature.

        State court lacked jurisdiction over complaint that labor agreement provision for hiring employees through union registration facilities and referral systems constituted direct economic intimidation designed to induce employers to alter their mode of business and to limit or increase the rate of wages and fringe benefits paid to their employees in violation of this section, where such complaint concerned activity arguably subject to section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act and the provision did not constitute a union security clause regulated by the states pursuant to section 14 of the Taft-Hartley Act.

      For the purposes of this section, the word “employer” includes every person, firm, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, the state of North Dakota, and all municipal corporations. If at the time of the death of any person, the person’s employer is indebted to the person for work, labor, or services performed, and no executor or administrator of the person’s estate has been appointed, such employer, upon the request of the surviving spouse, or, if there is no surviving spouse, then upon the request of the person’s next eligible heir or heirs as determined by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.30.1.html#t30c30.1-04s30.1-04-03" target="_blank">30.1-04-03</a></cite>, forthwith shall pay said indebtedness to the said surviving spouse or heirs. The employer shall require proof of the claimant’s or claimants’ relationship to the decedent by affidavit and shall require claimant or claimants to acknowledge receipt of such payment in writing. Any payments made by an employer pursuant to the provisions of this section operate as a full and complete discharge of the employer’s indebtedness to the extent of such payment, and no employer thereafter may be liable therefor to the decedent’s estate or the decedent’s executor or administrator thereafter appointed. Any amount so received by a spouse or heirs must be considered in diminution of the allowance provided for by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.30.1.html#t30c30.1-07s30.1-07-02" target="_blank">30.1-07-02</a></cite>.

        Labor agreement provision that hiring for job vacancies was to be conducted through union registration facilities and referral systems when the referral systems are not in violation of federal law, although not expressly stated to be nondiscriminatory, was not on its face discriminatory against employees by making union membership a condition of employment; absence such a discriminatory condition, section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act does not apply and state court does not have jurisdiction over complaint that such labor agreement violates the state’s right-to-work law enacted pursuant to section 14(b). Associated General Contractors v. Otter Tail Power Co., 611 F.2d 684, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 10164 (8th Cir. N.D. 1979).

        State court would not have jurisdiction of action alleging that agreement between power companies and various labor unions requiring that contractors performing construction work on power plant use union registration facilities and referral systems in filling job vacancies discriminated against employees on account of their status as members or nonmembers of a labor union in violation of this section since the agreement was silent on the question of discrimination and the court would not infer discrimination; absent discrimination, section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act did not apply and neither the state court, nor the federal district court to which the action was removed because of diversity of citizenship, had jurisdiction.

   Public policy of the state as established by the constitution and statutes is to protect an employee in his right to work free from any interference, restraint, or coercion by either the employer or a labor organization. Ficek v. International Bhd. of Boilermakers, 219 N.W.2d 860, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1974).

       </h5>
       <p>

   This section in no way interferes with the normal exercise of an employer’s right to choose his employees, or to discharge them, with or without cause. Sand v. Queen City Packing Co., 108 N.W.2d 448, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>

   An employer will not be prevented from discharging an inefficient employee merely because such employee is engaging, or has engaged, in union activities. Sand v. Queen City Packing Co., 108 N.W.2d 448, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>

   The so-called “Right to Work” law (this section) places but one limitation upon the employer’s right to discharge an employee, and that is that such discharge cannot be made “on account of” union membership or nonmembership of the employee.

       Collection of actual representation expenses from nonunion employees.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      As used in this section, “actual representation expenses” are only those actual expenses which are sustained by a labor union or labor organization in processing any grievance of a nonunion employee. For grievances arising from actions occurring while an employee was a member of a bargaining unit of a management entity with which a labor union or labor organization has a contract, but while that employee was not a member of that union or organization, that labor union or labor organization shall collect actual representation expenses from that nonunion employee. Actual representation expenses may be assessed only in instances in which a nonunion employee has specifically requested in writing to use representation by the labor union or labor organization. A nonunion employee may not be compelled to pay any expenses incurred by a labor union or labor organization in the course of general contract negotiations or collective bargaining. An assessment under this section is not an abridgement of any rights guaranteed under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t34c34-01s34-01-14" target="_self">34-01-14</a></cite>. This section does not abridge or in any way interfere with rights guaranteed employees generally under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 [29 U.S.C. 401 et seq.].

   In a declaratory judgment action brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S. §§ 2201 and 2202 by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) against the State of North Dakota, seeking a declaration that N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t34c34-01s34-01-14.1" target="_self">34-01-14.1</a></cite> was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), as amended, 29 U.S.C.S. § 151 et seq., the court found the jurisdictional requirements for a declaratory judgment action had been met under 28 U.S.C.S. § 2201 as an actual justiciable controversy was presented and granted the NLRB’s motion for summary judgment, declaring that N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t34c34-01s34-01-14.1" target="_self">34-01-14.1</a></cite> was in actual conflict with §§ 7 and 8 of NLRA, 29 U.S.C.S. §§ 157 and 158(b)(1), and as such, the state law was preempted by the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art VI, cl. 2, as a matter of law; N.D.C.C. § 34-01-14.1 regulated conduct that was actually protected by federal law because it mandated that unions charge non-union members for grievance processing whenever union representation was provided in response to a non-union member’s written request for representation.

   This section does not create a public policy against retaliatory discharge for participating in an internal investigation of other employees’ job performance. Jose v. Norwest Bank ND, N.A., 1999 ND 175, 599 N.W.2d 293, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section’s statute of limitations, not the six-year common law statute of limitations, applied to a retaliation claim by a whistleblowing employee against an employer because N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.01.html#t01c1-01s1-01-06" target="_blank">1-01-06</a></cite> provided that statutory enactments took precedence over and governed conflicting common law doctrines; attorney fees could not be awarded under subsection (3) of this section because the employee did not rely on the statute in bringing the claim. Vandall v. Trinity Hosps., 2004 ND 47, 676 N.W.2d 88, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        North Dakota’s whistleblower statute, N.D.C.C. § 34-01-20, was inapplicable to the claims of tortious interference with a prospective business advantage filed by a racing simulcast provider and its owner because there was no evidence to support the employee’s allegation that the whistleblower statute was intended to prevent an employer from filing a lawsuit against an employee for reporting an alleged violation of state law.
        Bala v. Stenehjem, 671 F. Supp. 2d 1067, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111133 (D.N.D. 2009).

   Because plaintiff commenced his retaliatory discharge action 178 days after his termination from employment, and the retaliatory discharge statute contained a 180-day statute of limitations running from the date the violation occurred, and because, when a statute of limitations had run, a dismissal without prejudice was appealable because it foreclosed litigation in plaintiff’s chosen forum, the order dismissing plaintiff’s complaint without prejudice was appealable. Ramirez v. Walmart, 2018 ND 179, 915 N.W.2d 674, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2018), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 139 S. Ct. 1188, 203 L.

       <p>

   Attorney fee award was affirmed because the record reflected that the district court considered all factors and the lodestar formula in calculating the amount of attorney fees awarded to the employee, when a comparison of hours and rates charged by opposing counsel was probative of the reasonableness of a request for attorney fees by prevailing counsel.

   Heng v. Rotech Med. Corp., 2006 ND 176, 720 N.W.2d 54, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 178</cite> (N.D. 2006).

         Causal Connection Between Protected Activity And Adverse Action.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   In the context of a retaliatory discharge claim, causation requires an employee to show more than the mere fact she reported violations and was subsequently fired; although there must be something more than pure speculation or conjecture, circumstantial evidence may provide an inference of causation. Proximity in time between the protected activity and the adverse employment action is “particularly significant,” and the fact that the employee’s complaints were directed toward or involved the person who ultimately fired her may also provide an inference that the adverse action was related to the protected activity; an inference of causation may also be drawn if the person who ultimately fires the employee was involved in the reported activity.

       <p>

   Employee failed to establish a prima facie case for retaliatory discharge where her statements to her supervisor regarding inappropriate touching amongst the residents of a residential treatment facility could only be construed as being made for the purpose of questioning disparate discipline of staff for incidents of inadequate supervision and not for the purpose of reporting a violation of the law. Dahlberg v. Lutheran Soc. Servs., 2001 ND 73, 625 N.W.2d 241, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>

   Summary judgment was properly granted in a retaliatory discharge case because a complaint letter to the North Dakota Insurance Commissioner only referring to an internal investigation was not a protected activity; moreover, another letter did not impact the decision since the salaries and benefits of two employees continued during an internal investigation.

   Jacob v. Nodak Mut. Ins. Co., 2005 ND 56, 693 N.W.2d 604, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee’s whistleblower claim, brought pursuant to N.D.C.C. §
        34-01-20, was dismissed on summary judgment because the employee failed to state a prima facie case; the employee had not reported a violation of federal or state law—the employer’s failure to give her 21 days’ consideration under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act prior to the waiver of any Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) claim was not a violation of the law, it merely invalidated any waiver. In any event, the employee had rejected the employer’s offer to allow her to work until her pension vested if she waived her ADEA claim, and therefore, the employee was not entitled to 21 days review. Ambers v. Vill. Family Serv. Ctr., Inc., 329 F. Supp. 2d 1046, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15688 (D.N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff commenced his action more than 180 days after he resigned from defendant organization’s board and thus his retaliation claim under N.D.C.C. § 34-01-20 was barred by the statute of limitations; the amendment of the organization’s constitution did not constitute discrimination or retaliation under North Dakota law and thus statute of limitations was not triggered.
        Clausen v. Nat'l Geographic Soc'y, 664 F. Supp. 2d 1038, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102722 (D.N.D. 2009), aff'd, 378 Fed. Appx. 595, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 11514 (8th Cir. N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee did not engage in a protected activity, as she did not report a violation or suspected violation of federal or state law to her employer; based on the evidence in the record alone, no reasonable jury could find that the employee made a “report” to her employer of a suspected violation of federal or state law. Holmes v. Trinity Health, 729 F.3d 817, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 18328 (8th Cir. N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court did not err in dismissing plaintiff’s retaliatory discharge claim because, although plaintiff alleged in his complaint that during a two-year period before his termination the total number of workers at the store was reduced from 98 to 56, and that he talked to supervisors about the series of layoffs or terminations of the other employees and told them the situation was unfair, plaintiff’s complaint did not identify any law or regulation allegedly violated by the store; this statute prohibited an employer from discharging an employee for reporting illegalities, and was not intended to protect an employee who acted for a purpose other than exposing an illegality; and unfair conduct was not synonymous with illegal conduct. Ramirez v. Walmart, 2018 ND 179, 915 N.W.2d 674, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2018), cert. denied, — U.S. —, 139 S. Ct. 1188, 203 L.

   Trial court erred in holding that, as a matter of law, an employee failed to establish she engaged in protected activity under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t34c34-01s34-01-20" target="_self">34-01-20</a></cite>, North Dakota’s whistle-blower statute. Although the trial court relied heavily upon the employee’s failure to report the suspected violations to any outside authority, there was no requirement under the statute that the employee report the suspected violation to a governmental body, law enforcement official, or corporate hotline; therefore, the employee’s failure to report the suspected violations to outside authorities was not conclusive evidence that she lacked good faith when making her reports.

   Heng v. Rotech Med. Corp., 2004 ND 204, 688 N.W.2d 389, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 338</cite> (N.D. 2004).

   Damage award in favor of the employee for her retaliatory discharge claim against the employer was affirmed because the employee established a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, and the district court’s finding that the employer failed to satisfy its burden of proving it terminated the employee for nonretaliatory reasons was not clearly erroneous, when the employee believed that the employer was not complying with North Dakota respiratory care regulations, the employee testified she reported the violation out of concern for the employer’s oxygen patients, and the employer’s stated reasons for terminating the employee were pretextual, as the employer failed to follow any of the disciplinary procedures contained in its employee handbook and failed to conduct an investigation into the complaints as called for by the handbook.

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t34c34-01s34-01-20" target="_self">34-01-20</a></cite>, the employer had “carried its burden” of demonstrating a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for firing the employee; the burden-shifting rule of McDonnell Douglas had little or no application at the summary judgment stage.

        Plaintiff sheriff’s deputy engaged in protected activity for purposes of the North Dakota whistleblower statute, N.D.C.C. § 34-01-20, when he filed a grievance in response to the refusal by defendants to provide him with copies of alleged complaints, a possible violation of county policy and North Dakota open records law. Furthermore, genuine issues of material fact existed as to whether the county’s proffered explanation for plaintiff’s termination was pretextual and plaintiff established a prima facie case of retaliation.
        Thus, summary judgment was denied as to this claim.

   It is master’s duty, not only to provide proper appliances for use of his employees, but also to exercise ordinary care to keep appliances in good repair. Meehan v. Great N. Ry., 13 N.D. 432, 101 N.W. 183, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>

   The master must not only provide safe and proper machinery, but must place it in control of competent servants. Warehime v. Huseby, 38 N.D. 344, 165 N.W. 502, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1917).

       <p>

   Where there is a safe and easy way of doing work, master is liable for ordering or permitting the doing of it in a way that was onerous and dangerous. Karas v. McAdoo, 46 N.D. 344, 179 N.W. 710, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1920).

       <p>

   This section is applicable in the case of a gratuitous employee as well as an employee for reward and, in determining employer’s liability, the same rule applies as in case of master and servant. Olson v. Kem Temple A. A. O. M. S., 77 N.D. 365, 43 N.W.2d 385, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1950); Jacobs v. Bever, 79 N.D. 168, 55 N.W.2d 512 (1952), distinguished, Borner v. Montana-Dakota Utils. Co., 65 N.W.2d 127 (N.D. 1954) and Severinson v. Nerby, 105 N.W.2d 252, 1960 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 1960).
       </p>
       <p>

   For plaintiff to be held to be a gratuitous employee of defendant there must be evidence that defendant requested plaintiff’s help. Severinson v. Nerby, 105 N.W.2d 252, 1960 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 1960).
       </p>
       <p>

   If plaintiff was a mere volunteer and undertook to assist without invitation and without contractual obligation to do so, defendant would not be liable for an injury suffered by him unless defendant was guilty of gross negligence, willfulness or wantonness. Severinson v. Nerby, 105 N.W.2d 252, 1960 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 1960).

        Former employer, which sued former employees for claims including breach of loyalty under N.D.C.C. § 34-02-14, was properly denied a preliminary injunction. The employer established a likelihood of success on the merits based on evidence that the employees solicited the employer’s customers while still working for the employer, but the district court found that harm to the employer could be addressed through an award of damages, and it appeared undisputed that an injunction would have put the employees out of business.

   Where the only evidence relied upon by the plaintiff to support his contention that he had a contract for permanent, lifetime employment was conclusory statements in his deposition that he had received the impression from his job interview that he had been hired for a permanent type and career type position, and he admitted that he had never been told by anyone that he would only be terminated for cause, there was no evidence in the record which raised a material factual issue regarding an alleged contractual agreement taking his employment outside the at-will rule of this section, and the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on this issue. Hillesland v. Federal Land Bank Ass'n, 407 N.W.2d 206, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 318</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   Evidence was insufficient to support jury’s finding that plaintiff in wrongful termination action was employed for specified term; fact finder could only find from evidence that plaintiff’s employment was at-will and plaintiff was subject to termination on notice, without cause. Phillips v. Dickinson Mgmt., 1998 ND 123, 580 N.W.2d 148, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1998).

        Plaintiff’s cause of action for breach of an implied covenant and agreement of good faith and fair dealing in an at-will employment relationship cannot rest solely on an alleged violation of a public policy against discrimination. Bakken v. North American Coal Corp., 641 F. Supp. 1015, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24160 (D.N.D. 1986).

       <p>

   Employer was entitled to summary judgment on a former employee's claims that the employee's termination violated the employer's employment policies and procedures because the evidence did not raise an inference that the employee was discharged because of the employee's age, but, rather, that the employee was terminated because the employee refused to be available for on-call responsibilities required for employees in the employee's position after the employer restructured the department in which the employee worked. Yahna v. Altru Health Sys., 2015 ND 275, 871 N.W.2d 580, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 2015).

         Employee Handbook.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   The presence of the clear and conspicuous disclaimer in the employee handbook, that the handbook not be construed to form a contract between the company and its employees, operated to preserve the presumption of at-will employment and thus the company was not bound to follow the “Progressive Discipline Policy” set forth in its employee handbook. Bailey v. Perkins Restaurants, 398 N.W.2d 120, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 455</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   A disclaimer contained in the closing statement of the personnel policy handbook of the defendant operated to preserve the presumption of at-will employment and defendant was not bound to follow the discipline procedures set forth in its employee handbook. Eldridge v. Evangelical Lutheran Good Samaritan Soc'y, 417 N.W.2d 797, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 446</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an employer promulgates a manual of personnel policies, the entire manual will be examined to determine whether it discloses an intent to overcome the presumption that when an employee is hired for an indefinite term in North Dakota, the employment is presumed to be at-will. Schmidt v. Ramsey County, 488 N.W.2d 411, 1992 N.D. App. LEXIS 1 (N.D. Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A clearly stated disclaimer in an employee personnel manual, stating that the policies in it are not intended to create contractual rights, may be a factor in determining whether an employee enjoys only an at-will employment status. Schmidt v. Ramsey County, 488 N.W.2d 411, 1992 N.D. App. LEXIS 1 (N.D. Ct. App. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   Language in an employee handbook that employer “is authorized ... to implement a reduction in force policy” is not sufficiently specific or definite to create a contractual obligation requiring employer to implement a policy before it may terminate employees based on a reduction in force. Pratt v. Heartview Found., 512 N.W.2d 675, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where employee policy manual stated it was not a contract, language that an employee should rely on the manual as a “source of information you can look to with authority and completeness” did not create an employment contract and overcome the presumption of at will employment provided in this section. Olson v. Souris River Telcoms. Coop., 1997 ND 10, 558 N.W.2d 333, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 11</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Trial court did not err in granting employer summary judgment on employee’s claim of termination in violation of her employment contract where the employee handbook unambiguously stated that the employee was an employee at-will and a progressive discipline policy did nothing to override that at-will presumption. Dahlberg v. Lutheran Soc. Servs., 2001 ND 73, 625 N.W.2d 241, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>

   When provisions in an employee policy manual expressly state that it does not create a contract, the employee is put on clear notice that the manual preserves the presumption of employment at will; therefore, an employee’s breach of contract claim was properly dismissed where the employee policy manual and other employment documentation, construed as a whole, explicitly and conspicuously disclaimed any employment contract and clearly evidenced the parties’

   intent that the employment was at will.

   Heng v. Rotech Med. Corp., 2004 ND 204, 688 N.W.2d 389, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 338</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>

   When a handbook contained a disclaimer as to a guarantee of employment, summary judgment for the corporation, which was the employer, was not appropriate because the district court still had to examine the handbook to discern the intent of the parties.

   Hunt v. Banner Health Sys., 2006 ND 174, 720 N.W.2d 49, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>

   When provisions in an employee policy manual expressly state that it does not create a contract, an employee is put on clear notice that the manual preserves the presumption of employment at will; however, this language should not be misunderstood to mean that an employer may only escape having his handbook or policy manual construed to be a contract of employment if it includes a clear and conspicuous disclaimer. If, upon consideration of the document as a whole, the handbook or policy manual does not evidence an intent to contract to overcome the at-will presumption, the absence of a clear and conspicuous disclaimer is not controlling; the presence of a disclaimer acts as a factor in an examination of the intent of the document as a whole, a district court still is required to examine the document to determine the intent of the parties, and when the disclaimer clearly, conspicuously, and unambiguously preserves the at-will presumption and no other evidence overcomes the at-will presumption, the disclaimer will be controlling.

   Hunt v. Banner Health Sys., 2006 ND 174, 720 N.W.2d 49, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2006).

        Where a former employee acknowledged in writing that she had received a bulletin from her employer that informed non-union employees of their status as employees at-will, and also included a statement that the position occupied by plaintiff employee was at-will, the employee was an at-will employee and could be terminated with or without cause.
        Humann v. KEM Elec. Coop., Inc., 450 F. Supp. 2d 1006, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63537 (D.N.D. 2006), aff'd, 497 F.3d 810, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 19136 (8th Cir. N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>

   Employer was entitled to summary judgment on a former employee's claims that the employee's termination violated the employer's employment policies and procedures because the employer's written policies, when read together, were not ambiguous and did not create a contractual relationship overcoming the at-will employment doctrine. Yahna v. Altru Health Sys., 2015 ND 275, 871 N.W.2d 580, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 2015).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Plaintiff employee/shareholder of close corporation was determined to be an at-will employee because there was no definite term prescribed for her employment by the corporation.

   Even though plaintiff was an at-will employee, and therefore could be terminated with or without cause, the termination of her employment triggered an inquiry into whether the corporation acted in a manner unfairly prejudicial toward plaintiff in her capacity as a shareholder-employee and, therefore, claims regarding the shareholders’ alleged breach of fiduciary duties with respect to her termination were properly analyzed within the framework of N.D.C.C. ch. 10-19.1. Kortum v. Johnson, 2008 ND 154, 755 N.W.2d 432, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 2008).

   There is no cause of action for breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing where the claimant relies upon an employment contract which contains no express term specifying the duration of employment. Hillesland v. Federal Land Bank Ass'n, 407 N.W.2d 206, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 318</cite> (N.D. 1987).

   By contract, parties can overcome the presumption of at will employment and create in the employee enforceable employment rights. Bykonen v. United Hosp., 479 N.W.2d 140, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   In construing an employment contract to determine its legal effect, this court will independently examine it in its entirety to determine the true intent of the parties. Bykonen v. United Hosp., 479 N.W.2d 140, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   If there is no fixed duration of employment, there is generally no employment contract; however, the parties, by contract, can overcome the presumption of at-will employment and create in the employee enforceable employment rights. Osterman-Levitt v. MedQuest, Inc., 513 N.W.2d 70, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court did not err in dismissing a former employee’s breach of employment contract claim against an employer. The district court’s implied finding that there was no oral agreement about employment for a definite term was not clearly erroneous; the district court’s reference to the lack of a writing was only further evidence that the parties never reached an oral agreement on employment for a definite term.

   Where the board of directors of a corporation determined to allow an employee to remain at his position until he found another job, it communicated the decision to him, and his employment continued, the facts of the case gave rise to a finding that the parties intended that the employee be employed for a reasonable time to allow him to look for a job.

   School district supervisor for transportation and food service, whose position was listed as classified, failed to raise a genuine issue as to any material fact about his wrongful termination claim, as no reasonable person could conclude that he overcame the presumption of at-will employment. Rykowsky v. Dickinson Pub. Sch. Dist. #1, 508 N.W.2d 348, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 213</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        General rule established that an agency agreement’s silence as to its duration was, without more, an unambiguous declaration that it was terminable at will by either party; accordingly, the district court properly declined to consider the extrinsic evidence submitted by a former agent in granting a company’s motion for summary judgment. Olander v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 317 F.3d 807, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 836 (8th Cir. N.D.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 825, 124 S. Ct. 179, 157 L. Ed. 2d 47, 2003 U.S. LEXIS 6089 (U.S. 2003).

   Hotels, restaurants, and inns were “public housekeeping establishments” within an order fixing minimum weekly wages for women employees for such establishments. A hospital was not a public housekeeping establishment since its main purpose was to care for and give medical attention to patients. Pagel v. Trinity Hosp.

   The Minimum Wage and Hour Law did not make it mandatory upon commissioner to take jurisdiction of all employees in the state; he could call a conference to investigate conditions of a particular class of workers. Pagel v. Trinity Hosp. Ass'n, 72 N.D. 262, 6 N.W.2d 392, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1942).

       <p>

   In an action to recover wages, where there was nothing in the record to show that the workers compensation bureau which was once entrusted with duty of carrying minimum wage law provisions into effect had prepared or adopted any modification or amendment of a particular order or that any conference had been called to consider the reclassification of certain workers, the order, as adopted, was binding on the parties to the action. Wiseth v. Traill County Tel. Co., 72 N.D. 165, 5 N.W.2d 307, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where an interpretation of a term used in an order was added by the commissioner as a postscript to the original order, and it did not appear when or how the postscript was added, the interpretation did not add anything to the order. Pagel v. Trinity Hosp. Ass'n, 72 N.D. 262, 6 N.W.2d 392, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1942).

       An employer may not require an employee to work seven consecutive days in a business that sells merchandise at retail. An employer may not deny an employee at least one period of twenty-four consecutive hours of time off for rest or worship in each seven-day period. The time off must be in addition to the regular periods of rest allowed during each day worked. An employer shall accommodate the religious beliefs and practices of an employee unless the employer can demonstrate that to do so would constitute an undue hardship on the conduct of the employer’s business. However, if an employee requests time off to attend one regular worship service a week, an employer may not require the employee to work during that period unless:

     </h3>
     <p>
      The public policy of this state is declared to be that the practice of discriminating on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees of one sex at a lesser rate than the rate paid to employees of the opposite sex for comparable work on jobs which have comparable requirements unjustly discriminates against the person receiving the lesser rate; leads to low worker morale, high turnover, and frequent labor unrest; discourages workers paid at the lesser wage rates from training for higher level jobs; curtails employment opportunities, decreases workers’ mobility, and increases labor costs; impairs purchasing power and threatens the maintenance of an adequate standard of living by such workers and their families; prevents optimum utilization of the state’s available labor resources; threatens the well-being of citizens of this state; and adversely affects the general welfare. It is therefore declared to be the policy of this state through exercise of its police power to correct and, as rapidly as possible, to eliminate discriminatory wage practices based on sex.

     <p>
      A minor fourteen or fifteen years of age may not be employed or permitted to work at any occupation, except in domestic services and at farm labor, before the hour of seven a.m. nor after the hour of seven p.m., except that these hours are seven a.m. to nine p.m. from June first through labor day, nor more than eighteen hours during schoolweeks, nor more than three hours on schooldays, nor more than forty hours during nonschoolweeks, nor more than eight hours on nonschooldays. A schoolweek is considered to be any week Sunday through Saturday in which a youth is required to be in attendance, for any period of time, four or more days. Provided, however, that the limitations restricting hours of work during schoolweeks and schooldays do not apply to minors who are not attending school because they are excepted from compulsory school attendance by subdivisions b, c, and d of subsection 1 of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.15.1.html#t15c15.1-20s15.1-20-02" target="_blank">15.1-20-02</a></cite>. Every employer shall post, in a conspicuous place where minors are employed, a printed notice stating the hours of work required of the minors each day of the week, the hours of commencing and stopping work, and the hours allowed for dinner or other meals. The printed form of the notice must be furnished by the labor commissioner. The employment of any minor for a longer period than that stated in the notice is a violation of this chapter.

   In an action for personal injuries, defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk were not available to employer of minor employed to assist in operating a circular saw. Leidgen v. Jones, 46 N.D. 410, 179 N.W. 714, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 1920).

   An allegation in a complaint for personal injuries that a minor under sixteen years of age was employed on construction work in violation of law is a sufficient allegation of negligence by an employer; the unlawful employment is regarded as, in itself, the proximate cause of the injury. Schnoor v. Meinecke, 75 N.D. 768, 33 N.W.2d 66, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1948).

   In a minor’s action for injury based on a claim that his employment was illegal under this section, the burden of proof was on the plaintiff to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that he was under sixteen at the time of the accident. Schnoor v. Meinecke, 77 N.D. 96, 40 N.W.2d 803, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1950).

      A minor under sixteen years of age may be employed to act or perform in a theater or place of amusement if a permit so to do is obtained from the minor’s parent or guardian and the labor commissioner or the commissioner’s agent or representative, if such person decides that the appearance of such minor will not be detrimental to the minor’s morals, health, safety, welfare, or education.

   A labor dispute existed where unionized employees went on strike and began picketing after employer, who did not pay union scale wages or maintain union conditions of employment, refused union demands, notwithstanding that only a few employees were union members.

       </h5>
       <p>
        State courts have no jurisdiction over claims arising from a labor agreement’s provision providing for an exclusive union referral system in job vacancies where such provision does not constitute a union ship or agency shop clause so as to be within section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act. Associated General Contractors v. Otter Tail Power Co., 457 F. Supp. 1207, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15468 (D.N.D. 1978), aff'd, 611 F.2d 684, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 10164 (8th Cir. N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        State court lacked jurisdiction over complaint that labor agreement provision for hiring employees through union registration facilities and referral systems violated this section, where such complaint concerned activity arguably subject to section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act and the provision did not constitute a union security clause that could be regulated by the state pursuant to section 14 of the Taft_Hartley Act. Associated General Contractors v. Otter Tail Power Co., 611 F.2d 684, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 10164 (8th Cir. N.D. 1979).

     <p>
      No court of this state may issue a restraining order or a temporary or permanent injunction in any case involving or growing out of a labor dispute except after hearing the testimony of witnesses in open court in support of the allegations of a complaint made under oath and the testimony offered in opposition thereto, and the granting to opposing parties of the right to cross-examine such witnesses, and except after the court has made and filed with the records in the case findings of fact to the effect that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t34c34-08s34-08-07ol11">
       Unlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed, or have been committed and will be continued, unless restrained;

     <p>
      No such restraining order or injunction may be issued on account of any threat or unlawful act except against a person, association, or organization making the threat or committing the unlawful act or authorizing or ratifying the same with actual knowledge thereof. Every restraining order or injunction granted in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute must include only a prohibition of such specific act or acts as may be expressly complained of in the complaint filed in such case and as shall be expressly included in the findings of fact.

   The granting of a temporary restraining order and a temporary or final injunction, when authorized, is a matter resting largely within the sound discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed except in case of clear abuse.

   Where it was shown that unlawful picketing had been committed and would continue unless restrained, the picketing threatened further trouble and irreparable injuries for which plaintiffs would have no adequate remedy at law, and that greater injury would result to plaintiffs than to defendant union by denial of relief, an injunction was properly granted. Minor v. Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council, 75 N.W.2d 139, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   Where the violence upon which plaintiff relied in an action under this section took place before the sheriff was advised, and after the sheriff came on the scene the picketing was peaceful, the plaintiff failed to prove that the sheriff was unwilling or unable to furnish police protection.

       Hearing required — Notice — When temporary order without notice may issue.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The hearing required under the provisions of section 34-08-07 must be held only after due and personal notice thereof has been given, in such manner as the court shall direct, to all known persons against whom relief is sought and also to the chief police officer of the county and city within which the unlawful acts have been threatened or committed. If a complainant alleges, however, that unless a temporary restraining order is issued without notice, a substantial and irreparable injury to complainant’s property will be unavoidable, such a temporary restraining order may be issued upon testimony under oath, sufficient, if sustained, to justify the court in issuing a temporary injunction upon a hearing after notice. Such a temporary restraining order becomes void at the expiration of five days. No temporary restraining order or injunction may be issued except on condition that complainant first shall file an undertaking with adequate security in an amount to be fixed by the court sufficient to recompense those enjoined for any loss, expense, or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of such order or injunction, including all reasonable costs, expenses, and a reasonable attorney’s fee, incurred in the defense against the order or against the granting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and subsequently denied by the court.

      The undertaking mentioned in section 34-08-08 constitutes an agreement entered into by the complainant and the complainant’s surety upon which a judgment may be rendered against the complainant and the complainant’s surety in the same proceeding in which such undertaking is filed, and such complainant and surety, by filing the undertaking, submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the court for such purpose. Such judgment shall be rendered only after a hearing to assess damages, and the complainant and the complainant’s surety must have reasonable notice of such hearing. Nothing contained in this section precludes any party having a claim for relief upon such undertaking from pursuing the party’s ordinary remedy by suit at law.

It is the function of such mediator to bring the parties together voluntarily under such favorable auspices as will tend to effectuate settlement of the dispute, but neither the mediator nor the commissioner has any power of compulsion in mediation proceedings. The commissioner shall provide necessary expenses for such mediators, other than for the commissioner or the commissioner’s deputy, as the commissioner may appoint, under reasonable compensation plus per diem expenses for each such mediator, and prescribe reasonable rules of procedure for such mediators.

     <p>
      The public policy of this state is declared to be that a worker is free to decline to associate with the worker’s fellow workers and is free to obtain employment wherever possible without interference or being hindered in any way, but that the worker also has the right to association and organization with the worker’s fellow employees and designation of representatives of the worker’s own choosing. A contract made and entered into between an employer of labor and a worker or workers or any agent, bargaining agent, or representative of a worker or workers is binding and equally enforceable upon both parties to said contract. Elections by secret ballot held to determine the question of who is the bargaining representative of a worker or workers or whether a worker or workers shall strike against an employer must be free and impartial without being influenced by either an employer or worker or any third parties. Secondary boycotts and sympathy strikes are hereby declared to be against public interest and unlawful.

        State court lacked jurisdiction over complaint that labor agreement provision for hiring employees through union registration facilities and referral systems violated this section, where such complaint concerned activity arguably subject to section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act and the provision did not constitute a union security clause that could be regulated by the state pursuant to section 14 of the Taft_Hartley Act. Associated General Contractors v. Otter Tail Power Co., 611 F.2d 684, 1979 U.S. App. LEXIS 10164 (8th Cir. N.D. 1979).

        State courts have no jurisdiction over claims arising from a labor agreement’s provision providing for an exclusive union referral system in job vacancies where such provision does not constitute a union shop or agency shop clause so as to be within section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act.

       For the purposes of this chapter, to bargain collectively means the performance of the mutual obligations of the employer and the representative of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, or the negotiation or renegotiation of an agreement, or any question thereunder, and the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party, but such obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a concession.

      <li id="t34c34-12s34-12-04ol12">
       When there is in effect a collective bargaining contract, the duty to bargain also means that no party to such contract may terminate or modify such contract at the conclusion of its term until sixty days after either party mails notice of a desire to terminate or to modify. A strike or lockout for economic purposes is unlawful until the end of the sixty-day period. The duty to bargain collectively continues despite termination of a collective bargaining contract unless the employee bargaining representative has lost its majority status.

       Decide that any craft unit is inappropriate for such purposes on the ground that a different unit has been established by a prior commissioner determination, unless a majority of the employees in the proposed craft unit vote against separate representation.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c34-12s34-12-06ol13">
       Decide that any unit is appropriate for such purposes if it includes, together with other employees, any individual employed as a guard to enforce against employees and other persons rules to protect property of the employer or to protect the safety of persons on the employer’s premises; but no labor organization may be certified as the representative of employees in a bargaining unit of guards if such organization admits to membership, or is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which admits to membership, employees other than guards.

If any party shall decline or neglect to appoint a representative, the commissioner shall appoint some fair and impartial person to act as such party’s representative. Such election board, consisting of a representative of the employees, a representative of the employer, and the commissioner shall thereupon designate a reasonable time within ten days after such board is constituted when such vote must be held, which election must be upon the premises of the employer during working hours. The board shall conduct an impartial secret ballot in which all employees of the appropriate bargaining unit involved have the right to cast a vote. Within twenty-four hours immediately after the completion of the election, such election board shall make an accurate and complete tabulation of the votes cast in such election and shall prepare a written certificate, which must bear the signature of the commissioner, and a copy of such certificate must be delivered to the employer and to the employees or their bargaining agent.

If on such second election fifty-one percent participation is not obtained, no further elections may be held for a period of one year.

     <p>
      No election may be directed in any bargaining unit or any subdivision within which in the preceding twelve-month period a valid election has been held.

In any election in which none of the choices on the ballot receives a majority, a runoff must be conducted, the ballot providing for a selection between the two choices receiving the largest and second largest number of valid votes cast in the election.

     <p>
      Whenever it is charged that any person is engaged in or has engaged in any unfair labor practice, the commissioner shall investigate the charges informally and if it appears that an unfair labor practice is occurring or has occurred, the commissioner has power to issue and cause to be served upon such person a written specification of the issues which are to be considered and determined. If, upon the evidence, the commissioner is of the opinion that any person named in the written specifications has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the commissioner shall issue and cause to be served upon such person an order requiring such person to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without backpay, as will effectuate the policies of this chapter. When an order requires reinstatement of an employee, backpay may be required of the employer or employee organization, as the case may be, responsible for the discrimination suffered by the employee. No order of the commissioner may require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to the individual of any backpay, if such individual was suspended or discharged for cause. If the order is not obeyed, the commissioner has the authority to apply to the appropriate district court for such action as is necessary to enforce the commissioner’s order, including injunction and mandamus proceedings. The commissioner may act as a conciliator in any labor dispute.

   Where an employment agency was unlicensed at the time it entered into a placement contract with an employee, the contract was unenforceable as against public policy and the agency’s action against the employee for breach of contract was dismissed even though the employee might have breached the contract by refusing to pay a placement fee as agreed.

      Annually, every applicant for a license shall file with the commissioner a written application stating the name and address of the applicant, the street and number of the building in which the employment agency is to be maintained, the name of the person who is to have the general management of the office, the name under which the business of the office is to be carried on, whether or not the applicant is pecuniarily interested in any other business of a like nature, and if so, where. Such application must also state whether the applicant is the only person pecuniarily interested in the business to be carried on under the license and must be signed by the applicant and sworn to before a notary public. If the applicant is a corporation, the application must state the names and addresses of the officers and directors of the corporation and must be signed and sworn to by the president and treasurer thereof. If the applicant is a limited liability company, the application must state the names and addresses of the managers and governors of the limited liability company and must be signed and sworn to by the president and treasurer thereof. If the applicant is a partnership, the application must also state the names and addresses of all partners therein and must be signed and sworn to by the managing partner or partners. The application must also state whether or not the applicant is, at the time of making application, or has at any previous time been, engaged or interested in, or employed by anyone engaged in, the business of conducting an employment agency, either in this state or any other, and if so, when and where. The application must also give as reference the names and addresses of at least three persons of reputed business or professional integrity, located within the state. Every applicant for a license to engage in the business of an employment agent shall, at the time of making application for said license, file with the commissioner a schedule of the fees or charges to be collected by such employment agent for any services rendered, together with all rules and regulations that may in any way affect the fees charged or to be charged for any service. Such fees and such rules or regulations may thereafter be changed by filing an amended or supplemental schedule showing such charges, with the commissioner. It is unlawful for any employment agent to charge, demand, collect, or receive a greater compensation for any service performed by the agent than is specified in such schedule filed with the commissioner.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commissioner may issue a license to an employment agent and refuse to issue a license if, after due investigation, the commissioner finds that the character of the applicant makes the applicant unfit to be an employment agent, or when the premises for conducting the business of an employment agent are found to be unfit. The commissioner may revoke a license upon due notice to the holder of the license and upon due cause. Failure to comply with the duties, terms, conditions, or provisions of this chapter, or any lawful orders of the commissioner is due cause to revoke a license.

      Every application for a license must be accompanied by a bond in the penal sum of five thousand dollars, with one or more sureties or a duly authorized surety company, to be approved by the commissioner and filed in the commissioner’s office, conditioned that the agent will conform to and not violate any of the terms or requirements of this chapter or violate the covenants of any contract made by such agent in the conduct of said business.

Every receipt to an applicant by an employment agent must be numbered and bound in duplicate form. A duplicate copy of each receipt must be kept at least one year.

This record must contain the name and address of the employer by whom the services were solicited, the name and address of the employee, kind of position offered by the employer, kind of position accepted by the employee, probable duration of the employment, rate of wage or salary to be paid the employee, amount of the employment agent’s service charge, dates and amounts of payments, date and amount of refund, if any, and for what, and a space for remarks under which must be recorded anything of an individual nature to amplify the foregoing report and as information in the event of any question arising concerning the transaction. Such records must during business hours be open to the inspection of the commissioner at the address where the employment agency is conducted for the purpose of satisfying the commissioner that they are being kept in conformity with this section. Upon written complaint being made, the commissioner may require of the employment agent against whom the complaint is made a detailed account under oath in writing of the transaction referred to in the complaint. If the commissioner has reason to question the detailed report so submitted by the employment agent, the commissioner may demand of the employment agent the production of these records for examination by the commissioner, or the commissioner’s agent, at such place as the commissioner may designate.

This chapter does not prevent an employment agent from directing an applicant to an employer where the employer has previously requested that the employer be accorded interviews with applicants of certain types and qualifications, even though no actual vacancy existed in the employer’s organization at the time the applicant was so directed; nor does it prevent the employment agent from attempting to sell the services of an applicant to the employer even though no order has been placed with the employment agent; provided, that in any case the applicant is acquainted with the facts when directed to the employer, in which event no employment agent is liable to any applicant as provided in this section.

      Every employer shall pay all wages due to employees at least once each calendar month on regular agreed paydays designated in advance by the employer. Wages must be paid in lawful money of the United States; with checks, as that item is used in chapter 41-03, drawn on banks or credit unions convenient to the place of employment; with direct deposit in the financial institution of the employee’s choice; or, at the election of the employee when offered by the employer, by delivery to the employee of a stored value card that meets the requirements of this section. A stored value card that is used by an employer to pay wages must be issued by a federally insured bank or credit union. The value of the funds underlying a stored value card that is used by an employer to pay wages must be a deposit that is insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or national credit union administration. Before paying wages by delivering a stored value card to an employee, an employer must have deposited with the issuer funds in an amount at least equal to the wages due from the employer to each employee whose wages are being paid through a stored value card and any account fees that are charged to the employer by the issuer.

      Whenever an employee is discharged or terminated from employment by an employer, separates from employment voluntarily, or is suspended from work as the result of an industrial dispute, the employee’s unpaid wages or compensation becomes due and payable at the regular paydays established in advance by the employer for the periods worked by the employee. When an employer discharges or terminates an employee, the employer shall pay those wages to the employee by certified mail at an address designated by the employee or as otherwise agreed upon by both parties. If the employer fails to pay the wages within the stated time, the employee may charge and collect wages in the sum agreed upon in the contract of employment for each day the employer is in default until the employer has paid in full, without rendering any service therefor, except the employee shall cease to draw wages or salary thirty days after such default.
