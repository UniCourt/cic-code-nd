   The workers’ compensation fund is like an accident insurance fund in that it is a fund made available when an injury occurs. However, the workers’ compensation fund is unlike an accident insurance fund in that (1) it is governmentally created and administered, (2) the injury must be work-related, and (3) because it is work-related questions of fault are irrelevant. Thus the workers’ compensation fund is not a health or accident insurance fund. Beyer's Cement v. North Dakota Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 417 N.W.2d 370, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

Reviewing the principles of North Dakota's workers' compensation law and noting that exclusions in an insurance policy at issue limited the policy coverage to liabilities that were not excluded by the remedy of workers' compensation, the court determined that if the trailer owner was acting as a common law independent contractor, North Dakota law will apparently permit the employee to recover in the negligence action.

      The sole exception to an employer’s immunity from civil liability under this title, except as provided in chapter 65-09, is an action for an injury to an employee caused by an employer’s intentional act done with the conscious purpose of inflicting the injury.

        Summary Judgment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   District court properly granted a decedent's former employer summary judgment dismissing a widow's wrongful death action because sufficient facts had not been alleged to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the employer engaged in an intentional act with the conscious purpose of inflicting the decedent's injuries pursuant to the Workforce Safety and Insurance Act Bartholomay v. Plains Grain &amp; Agronomy, LLC, 2016 ND 138, 881 N.W.2d 249, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>

   District court did not err in dismissing an employee’s negligence action as a matter of law because an employee and coworker were immune from suit under the Workforce Safety and Insurance Act’s exclusive remedy provisions; determinations in California administrative proceedings were irrelevant for deciding immunity since the employer paid Workforce Safety and Insurance premiums to secure coverage on the employee’s behalf, and the employee received benefits throughout the California proceedings.

To demonstrate an actual loss of wages or remuneration as a result of a change in the claimant’s compensable medical condition, the claimant must necessarily first demonstrate that he was earning wages from employment when the change in his medical condition occurred and must then show that the change caused at least a partial loss of those wages.

   Acceleration of preexisting disease to fatal conclusion by excessive artificial heat under which employee labored, was an injury within workers’ compensation act. Pace v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 51 N.D. 815, 201 N.W. 348, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 1924); Pfeiffer v.

       </p>
       <p>

   Employee did not suffer a compensable injury to the back under this section because the injury was attributable to a preexisting injury suffered in a car accident; moreover, the employee was unable to establish that the condition was substantially accelerated or worsened by the conditions of employment, which included standing, lifting, and walking. Myhre v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2002 ND 186, 653 N.W.2d 705, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 239</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>

   Worker's compensation claimant's medical benefits claim was properly denied as he failed to show his work activities substantially accelerated the progression or substantially worsened the severity of a preexisting condition because the evidence showed that the claimant had substantial back pain prior to beginning work at his former employer, and that when the claimant had back pain in August 2010, it was substantially similar to prior times, including the time before he started working for his former employer. Frith v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2014 ND 93, 845 N.W.2d 892, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 1027, 135 S. Ct. 719, 190 L.

   A claimant must show, by a simple preponderance of the evidence, a compensable injury in order to participate in the workers compensation fund. Moses v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 429 N.W.2d 436, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   The presumed fact is that the condition was suffered in the line of duty and is not a preexisting disease, and the statute shifts the burden to the bureau to prove “that the nonexistence of the presumed fact is more probable than its existence.” Flermoen v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 470 N.W.2d 220, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   Because an administrative law judge (ALJ) did not apply the correct standard when evaluating conflicting medical opinions on causation where the ALJ’s rationale for discounting the opinion favorable to the claimant relied upon the importance of supporting a medical opinion with another scientific authority, such as a treatise or a published report of a study and neither the statutes nor case law imposed such a requirement, and because the court was unpersuaded by the ALJ’s speculation as to factual errors in the opinions, the court reversed an order affirming a decision of the Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance Fund denying benefits for treatment of a worker’s back injury. The court also noted that it did not understand the ALJ’s reference to a “particularly heavy burden” and stated that the claimant need only prove it was more likely than not that his injuries were caused by his employment.

   Preexisting high blood pressure was cause of stroke suffered by an employee, even though stroke occurred shortly after an argument in course of employment, so there was no compensable injury.

   Though an injury is compensable if received in course of employment, disease from which a worker dies must be one proximately caused by the employment to be compensable. McKinnon v.

   Hemorrhage of an ulcer was not compensable where evidence tending to show relationship to employment was purely speculative. Wobbe v. Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 73 N.D. 256, 13 N.W.2d 712, 1944 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 1944).

   Death due to cerebral hemorrhage was not compensable where evidence failed to establish that hemorrhage was fairly traceable to pneumonia caused by exposure during employment. Feist v.

   Lack of evidence linking worker’s lung condition to fumes and particles in the workplace supported Workers Compensation Bureau’s finding that the lung condition was neither caused nor aggravated by his employment.

   The supreme court declined to make findings regarding whether multiple chemical sensitivity is a disease; the claimant failed to prove that any condition resulting in injury was fairly traceable to her employment.

Because the positional risk doctrine requires a claimant only to show that an injury was sustained while at work, the doctrine directly contravenes both the language of

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-02" target="_self">65-01-02</a></cite>(10) [now subsec. (11)] and the legislature’s stated intent in adding the “arising out of” element.

       <p>

   Because appellant was unable to show a causal connection between her unexplained fall at work and her employment, the administrative law judge properly denied her request for workers’

   compensation. Appellant did not meet her burden of showing an injury “arising out of” her employment for purposes of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-02" target="_self">65-01-02</a></cite>(10).

   Where conflicting medical testimony was given by two physicians on issue of whether work-related injuries aggravated or accelerated the progression of claimant’s congenital spondylolisthesis and Worker’s Compensation Bureau adequately explained its reasons for accepting one physician’s opinion, Supreme Court would not make independent findings or substitute its judgment for that of the Bureau.

   Workers Compensation Bureau sufficiently clarified conflicting reports among the four doctors who examined the claimant and thus the Bureau’s determination that injuries to the claimant’s neck, back and shoulder were caused by her degenerative disc disease rather than her fall at work was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

   Administrative law judge (ALJ) correctly denied a worker's claim for workforce safety and insurance benefits because (1) the ALJ found no specific incident occurred resulting in the worker's injury, (2) the worker did not relate the worker's symptoms to work activities, (3) the worker presented no objective medical findings supporting a medical opinion that the worker's repetitive work activities caused or accelerated the progression of, or substantially worsened the severity of, the worker's hernia, and (4) a contrary opinion contained details showing the worker's job was neither the cause of the hernia, nor a substantial contributing factor.

   Reports favorable to plaintiff’s claim that gas and exhaust fumes in school bus that she drove made her ill did not adequately take into account her sensitivity to certain fragrances prior to her employment with the school district, nor her years of smoking cigarettes; the record contained sufficient evidence to conclude that a reasonable mind could reasonably find that her illness was not “fairly traceable” to employment with the school district, or that her employment, at most, “triggered” a preexisting condition, but did not substantially aggravate or accelerate her illness.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A heart attack caused by exertion is in itself an accident, not a disease, and therefore it is immaterial that a preexisting disease contributed to the death; subdivision 7a (now subdivision 10(a)) of this section was not applicable where myocardial infarction was an accident, and thus claimant was entitled to recover despite preexisting disease contention made by bureau. Stout v. North Dakota Workmen’s Comp. Bureau, 236 N.W.2d 889 (N.D. 1975), overruled on other grounds, Balliet v. North Dakota Workmen’s Comp. Bureau, 297 N.W.2d 791 (N.D. 1980), decided prior to the amendment to this section by Session Laws 1977, ch. 579.
       </p>
       <p>

   Fact that an employee may have physical conditions or personal habits which make him more prone to a heart disease is not a reason for denying a claim if the preponderance of the evidence indicates that the heart attack was causally related to the workers’ employment, with reasonable medical certainty, and was precipitated by unusual stress. Nelson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 316 N.W.2d 790, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   Testimony by widow and fellow worker of deceased that deceased had been under unusual emotional stress related to his employment was insufficient to establish that fatal heart attack suffered by deceased while at work was precipitated by unusual stress. Nelson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 316 N.W.2d 790, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   This subsection was amended by chapter 579, section 2, 1977 N.D. Session Laws, to allow benefit awards for heart attacks only where there is evidence of “unusual” stress. Nelson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 316 N.W.2d 790, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   Employee was not entitled to benefits for an injury due to a heart attack where she failed to prove by weight of evidence that neither work-related stress over four-year course of her employment as a kitchen helper nor on day of her heart attack constituted an unusual or out-of-the-ordinary stress; and thus she failed to prove her heart attack was precipitated by unusual stress in course of her employment. Ganske v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 355 N.W.2d 800, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 385</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>

   In order to prove that a heart attack is a compensable injury, the claimant must also prove that the attack was causally related to the worker’s employment, with reasonable and medical certainty. Christianson v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 470 N.W.2d 613, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   In order to satisfy the “unusual stress” requirement, the work causing the heart attack need not be different in nature from the claimant’s usual work. Rather, so long as the conditions of performing the work are such that an exceptional strain is imposed on the worker so great that his heart is affected and damaged thereby, the requirement of unusual or excessive strain is satisfied. Christianson v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 470 N.W.2d 613, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   In a worker’s compensation matter involving a claim by a surviving spouse for death benefits, the administrative law judge (ALJ) did not err in concluding decedent died as a result of a heart attack caused by work-related stress, which was compensable under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-02" target="_self">65-01-02</a></cite>(10)(a)(3), as the ALJ relied on the testimony of the decedent’s primary care physician, who testified that long-term pain that the decedent suffered caused extraordinary stress, that long-term stress was a risk factor for heart attacks, and that stress was at least fifty percent of the cause of the decedent’s fatal heart attack as compared to all other factors. The ALJ clarified inconsistencies in the evidence and adequately explained his reasons for disregarding the testimony of the employer’s experts.

   A back injury may satisfy the “injury by accident” requirement of this section not only if the cause of the injury was of accidental character, but also if the cause is routine and the result is not foreseen, intended, or anticipated; thus, an injury such as acute disc syndrome, which can be medically related to repeated stress or strain in a claimant’s usual work exertions, is a compensable injury under the workers’ compensation act. Satrom v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 328 N.W.2d 824, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 393</cite> (N.D. 1982).

       <p>

   Issues decided by the administrative law judge (ALJ) on remand were included in the issues the supreme court sent back and, therefore, the ALJ did not go beyond the terms of the mandate; the supreme court’s decision only required the ALJ to determine and make consistent sufficient findings as to whether an employee sustained a “compensable injury,” and the ALJ’s revised order included additional specific findings on the medical evidence and determined the employee sustained a compensable injury. State v. Sandberg, 2021 ND 39, 956 N.W.2d 342, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 2021).

       <p>

   Administrative law judge (ALJ) properly found that an employee had sustained a compensable injury and was entitled to benefits because the ALJ made specific findings regarding the ALJ’s consideration of the evidence presented at the hearing, weighed the doctors’ competing opinions; because the ALJ had the opportunity to observe witnesses and the responsibility to assess the credibility of witnesses and resolve the conflicts in the evidence, the supreme court would not reweigh the evidence.

   Where the only medical evidence in the record showed that the claimant had a permanent partial impairment, both physicians discerned pain and its effect, and they identified objective evidence indicative of impairment, the workers compensation bureau erred in denying compensation solely because the claimant’s impairment was not substantiated by objective medical evidence under the American medical association’s guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment. Accordingly, the action was remanded for further proceedings by the bureau to determine the extent of impairment. Kroeplin v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 415 N.W.2d 807, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 440</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   Administrative law judge’s findings were not sufficient to understand the basis for the decision that the claimant sustained a compensable injury because the administrative law judge did not cite any medical evidence supported by objective medical findings in the record to support a determination that the claimant’s repetitive work activities did not merely trigger symptoms, but rather substantially worsened the severity of his preexisting degenerative disc disease.

       <p>

   A reasoning mind could not reasonably conclude that an employee’s daily journey to West Fargo to pick up co-workers was not part of the service for which he was employed, given the special degree of inconveniences under which the journey was made, the evidence of the employer’s expectations of the employee, and the benefits derived by the employer. The evidence showed that the employer became upset with the claimant and “chewed him out” on one occasion when the claimant failed to drive the company vehicle to the job-site and told him, on that occasion, that if he couldn’t get the company vehicle to the job-site each morning he “might as well not even come.” Diegel v.

   The crux of the part-of-service exception is that the travel of the employee is itself a part of the work within the employer/employee relationship.

   Administrative law judge misapplied the law in finding the injury was attributable to the worker's preexisting condition because it made him more susceptible to injury; the worker's susceptibility to the injury because of his preexisting condition did not make the injury attributable to the preexisting condition, and instead, there had to be some evidence that the injury triggered symptoms in the worker's preexisting condition or some other evidence that his current condition was attributable to the preexisting condition.

   Preponderance of the evidence established the pain was not a symptom of the preexisting condition and the injury did not trigger symptoms of his preexisting condition, and the evidence established a causal relationship between the work injury and the worker's condition for which he sought treatment, and thus the administrative law judge erred in finding that the worker failed to prove he sustained a compensable injury.

   A reasoning mind reasonably could have determined that the worker’s injury was not in any way employment related, where the undisputed evidence disclosed that he was riding on his own motorcycle; that he was not on the employer’s premises; that he was, in fact, on a public highway; that he was driving home after work hours, and was not being compensated for traveling to and from work at the time of his injury.

   As a general rule, injuries occurring while traveling to and from work are noncompensable. There are several exceptions to this general rule, one of which is when the travel is an integral part of the service for which the worker is employed. Diegel v.

   Claimant’s travel to work was neither employer supplied nor employer required where he was merely commuting to work with his roommate who was also employed by the same construction firm; furthermore, despite being paid a higher wage for working out-of-town, none of claimant’s wages was intended as travel expenses and the fact that claimant was paid upon arrival at work did not indicate that travel to the job site was an integral part of service.

   Although the claimant’s North Dakota employment acted as a substantial contributing factor in the development of the underlying dormant degenerative disc disease, where but for a June, 1988, triggering injury in Wisconsin, the claimant could have continued to work without medical treatment as before the injury, the Wisconsin injury caused the disability the claimant sustained.

   Appellant’s testimony of high temperatures, unusual work duties as masonry foreman, emotional anxiety related to being behind schedule, and fear attributable to the movement of a crane overhead was not convincing enough for the North Dakota supreme court to conclude that the bureau’s finding of no “unusual stress” was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

   Self-employed appliance, service, and refrigerator technician who worked in a garage which did not provide for any fresh air ventilation, failed to prove by the weight of the evidence from the entire record that the heart attack which he suffered while working was causally related to his employment and was precipitated by unusual stress, so as to entitle him to compensation.

   Providing an excuse for voluntarily drinking cannot be a substantial contributing factor to alcoholism. Thus, employee’s voluntary activities in drinking to excess following a bad performance review broke the causal link necessary to establish an injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and the bureau could have reasonably determined that employee’s employment was not a substantial contributing factor to his recurrent alcoholism.

   Words “including an injury caused by the willful act of a third person directed against an employee because of his employment” do not preclude compensation for an injury caused by willful act of third person that has no relation to the employment.

   Bureau’s finding under this section and former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-12" target="_self">65-05-12</a></cite> that worker was not entitled to chronic pain evaluation was supported by evidence; while the claimant presented evidence of pain, the claimant did not establish that he suffered from chronic pain.

         Seasonal Employment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   It was proper for the North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau to infer that the claimant was engaged in seasonal employment; from the claimant’s testimony, the bureau could have inferred that the claimant worked in occupations with periods of 45 consecutive days where the claimant did not receive wages. Meljie v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2002 ND 174, 653 N.W.2d 62, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 223</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court erred in affirming the decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ) that an electrician's employment with a contractor was not seasonal employment because the ALJ failed to correctly apply the language of subsection (27) [now subsec. (30)] to the contractor's employment of electricians; the contractor hired 719 electricians in a five-year period, and the transfer of nine electricians did not establish what was customary for it.

   Indus. Contrs., Inc. v. Taylor, 2017 ND 183, 899 N.W.2d 680, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>

   Use of the phrase “includes occupations” in subsection (27) [now subsec. (30)] enlarges the plain and ordinary meaning of “seasonal employment” to include occupations (1) that are not permanent or (2) that do not customarily operate throughout the year; the two alternatives are separated by “or” indicating the alternatives are disjunctive, and the first alternative indicates seasonal employment can be non-permanent employment, which is not customarily limited to certain times of the year.

   Indus. Contrs., Inc. v. Taylor, 2017 ND 183, 899 N.W.2d 680, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>

   Under the language in the second sentence of subsection (27) [now subsec. (30)], “seasonal employment” is not a generic term, but can vary depending upon what is customary with the employer; nothing in the statute imposes a time limitation on seasonal employment.

   Indus. Contrs., Inc. v. Taylor, 2017 ND 183, 899 N.W.2d 680, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 2017).

   Even if former subdivision 12(d) of this section was unconstitutional, the remedy lied in invalidating this section rather than extending its benefits to all employees. Kroh v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 425 N.W.2d 899, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   There was a presumption in favor of firemen and law enforcement officers. Procedurally, the presumption operated to shift the burden of proof from the claimant to the bureau. Sunderland v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 370 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   A claimant seeking workers’ compensation benefits from the bureau had the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he was entitled to participate in the fund. However, former subsection (17)(d), created a limited exception to this general rule which shifted the burden of proof from the claimant to the bureau in cases involving specified conditions or impairments of health suffered by a fireman or law enforcement officer. Flermoen v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 470 N.W.2d 220, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   To demonstrate that an occupational cancer was involved, the fireman claimant need only have shown that the type of cancer he had was linked to exposure to smoke, fumes, or other hazardous substances incurred by firemen in the line of duty or that such exposure had been linked to an increased risk of incurring the type of cancer suffered by the claimant. If the claimant demonstrated this linkage by a preponderance of the evidence, the presumption arose under former subsection (17)(d), that the claimant incurred his cancer in the line of duty and was entitled to benefits. The burden then shifted to the bureau to prove otherwise. Flermoen v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 470 N.W.2d 220, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   In order to prevail, the workers’ compensation bureau had to establish that an illness was not work related, overcoming the presumption it was work related. Burrows v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 510 N.W.2d 617, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>

   Former subsection 17(d) of this section, created a limited exception to the general rule by shifting the burden of proof from the claimant to the bureau in cases involving specified conditions or impairments of health suffered by a full-time paid fireman. Christianson v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 470 N.W.2d 613, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   The specific presumptions set forth in former subsection (17)(d) did not apply to all municipal employees, they only applied to full-time municipal firemen. This section of law was not ambiguous and thus was not susceptible to any other interpretation. Therefore, according to the plain language of the statute, the presumption did not apply to volunteer firefighters or those who were not full-time paid firemen. Christianson v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 470 N.W.2d 613, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1991).

         —Lung Disease.

       </p>

   Carcinoma of the lung qualified as a lung disease. Sunderland v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 370 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where the workers’ compensation bureau proved lack of relationship between claimant’s occupation and his lung cancer, the question of whether the cancer preexisted his employment was irrelevant. Burrows v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 510 N.W.2d 617, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1994).

         —Rebuttable Presumption.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>

   Former subdivision 12(d) contained two rebuttable components. In order for the bureau to rebut the presumption in its entirety, it had to show that the disease was preexisting and that it was not work-related. Sunderland v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 370 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   Bureau had to introduce evidence of nonwork-related causation in order to rebut the presumption created thereby. Sunderland v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 370 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   Medical opinion which was inconclusive as to the relationship between police officer’s occupation and his lung cancer constituted insufficient evidence to sustain the bureau’s burden of proving that his cancer was not work-related. Sunderland v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 370 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   Medical evidence that police officer’s death from lung cancer was due to cigarette smoking, together with evidence that the officer’s employment and alleged exposure to radon, radar, and asbestos were not a significant contributing factor to his lung cancer, rebutted the presumption of job-related causation. Elter v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 179, 599 N.W.2d 315, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1999) (applying 1993 version of statute).

   Berger v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 224, 620 N.W.2d 576, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 273</cite> (N.D. 2000).

       <p>

   In a worker’s compensation case, a benefits claimant and other similarly situated welders were properly found to be independent contractors under the common law test. Inter alia, the claimant and other welders used their own equipment, tools, trucks, and paid their expenses; moreover, a rig foreman instructed the welders, there was no continuing relationship between the employer and the claimant, there was no set work schedule, and the claimant worked for other companies.

       <p>

   Finding that dealer of multipurpose home cleaning machines was employee of area distributor for workers’ compensation purposes was sufficiently supported by evidence, where distributor had the right to discipline dealer, including termination at any time without liability, and to control sales of product to customers, and distributor trained dealers and facilitated financing and closing of sales; contractual designation of dealer as an independent contractor was not binding on the parties.

   Decedent’s transporting of company’s products to its customers was integral part of company’s business so that decedent was employee rather than an independent contractor when tractor he was driving collided with freight train as decedent returned from delivering trailer load of company’s products in one of company’s trailers; fact that company’s signs covered decedent’s name on cab of tractor and that decedent was paid monthly rather than at end of each trip were significant in determining his status; modern tendency is to find employment when work being done is integral part of regular business of employer and when worker, relative to employer, does not furnish an independent business or professional service.

   Co-employees retain their status as co-employees and their immunity from tort liability so long as they are acting in the course of their employment; the most satisfactory test to determine course of employment for purposes of co-employee immunity is the same course-of-employment test used to determine basic compensation coverage. Under that standard, in determining co-employee immunity, the test is whether the negligent co-employee would have been entitled to receive workers’ compensation benefits if that co-employee had been injured in the same incident.

   An employer is deemed to have intended to injure if the employer had knowledge an injury was certain to occur and willfully disregarded that knowledge. Zimmerman v. Valdak Corp., 1997 ND 203, 570 N.W.2d 204, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 261</cite> (N.D. 1997).

       Injury through negligence of third person — Option of employee — Organization subrogated when claim filed — Lien created.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When an injury or death for which compensation is payable under provisions of this title has been sustained under circumstances creating in some person other than the organization a legal liability to pay damages in respect thereto, the injured employee, or the injured employee’s dependents may claim compensation under this title and proceed at law to recover damages against such other person.
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol11">
       The organization is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee or the injured employee’s dependents to the extent of fifty percent of the damages recovered up to a maximum of the total amount the organization has paid or would otherwise pay in the future in compensation and benefits for the injured employee. The organization also has a lien to the extent of fifty percent of the damages recovered up to a maximum of the total amount the organization has paid in compensation and benefits. The organization’s subrogation interest or lien may not be reduced by settlement, compromise, or judgment. The action against such other person may be brought by the injured employee, or the injured employee’s dependents in the event of the injured employee’s death. Such action shall be brought in the injured employee’s or in the injured employee’s dependents’ own right and name and as trustee for the organization for the subrogation interest of the organization. However, if the director chooses not to participate in an action, and the decision is in writing, the organization has no subrogation interest and no obligation to pay fees or costs under this section and no lien.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol12">
       If the injured employee or the injured employee’s dependents do not institute suit within sixty days after date of injury, the organization may bring the action in its own name and as trustee for the injured employee or the injured employee’s dependents and retain as its subrogation interest the full amount it has paid or would otherwise pay in the future in compensation and benefits to the injured employee or the injured employee’s dependents and retain as its lien the full amount the organization has paid in compensation and benefits. In the alternative, the organization may bring an action against a third party to recover its lien for benefits paid to the injured employee. Within sixty days after both the injured employee and the organization have declined to commence an action against a third person as provided above, the employer may bring the action in the employer’s own name or in the name of the injured employee, or both, and in trust for the organization and for the injured employee. The party bringing the action may determine if the trial jury should be informed of the trust relationship.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol13">
       If the action is brought by the injured employee or the injured employee’s dependents, or the employer as provided in subsection 2, the organization shall pay fifty percent of the costs of the action, exclusive of attorney’s fees, when such costs are incurred as the action progresses before recovery of damages. If there is no recovery of damages in the action, this shall be a cost of the organization to be paid from the organization’s general fund. After recovery of damages in the action, the costs of the action, exclusive of attorney’s fees, must be prorated and adjusted on the percentage of the total subrogation interest of the organization recovered to the total recovery in the action. The organization shall pay attorney’s fees to the injured employee’s attorney from the organization’s general fund as follows:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol13a">
         Twenty-five percent of the subrogation interest recovered for the organization before judgment; and
        </li>
        <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol13b">
         Thirty-three and one-third percent of the subrogation interest recovered for the organization when recovered through judgment entered as a result of a trial on the merits or recovered through binding alternative dispute resolution.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol14">
       The above provisions as to costs of the action and attorney’s fees are effective only when the injured employee advises the organization in writing the name and address of the injured employee’s attorney, and the injured employee has employed such attorney for the purpose of collecting damages or of bringing legal action for recovery of damages. If an injured employee fails to pay the organization’s subrogation interest and lien within thirty days of receipt of a recovery in a third-party action, the organization’s subrogation interest is the full amount of the damages recovered, up to a maximum of the total amount it has paid or would otherwise pay in the future in compensation and benefits to the injured employee or the injured employee’s dependents, no costs or attorney’s fees will be paid from the organization’s subrogation interest and the organization’s lien is the full amount of the damages recovered up to a maximum of the total amount it has paid.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol15">
       The organization’s lien is created upon first payment of benefits. The lien attaches to all claims, demands, settlement proceeds, judgment awards, or insurance payable by reason of a legal liability of a third person. If the organization does not receive payment of its lien amount within thirty days of the payment of any recovery and if the organization has served, by regular mail, written notice of its lien upon the injured employee or the injured employee’s dependents and upon the third person, the insurer of the third person, the injured employee or injured employee’s dependents, and the attorney of the injured employee or injured employee’s dependents are liable to the organization for the lien amount. A release or satisfaction of any judgment, claim, or demand given by the injured employee or the injured employee’s dependents is not valid or effective against the lien. An action to collect the organization’s lien amount must be commenced within one year of the organization first possessing actual knowledge of a recovery.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol16">
       Upon receipt of its subrogation interest, the organization shall credit the medical expense assessment paid by the employer under section 65-04-04.4 to the employer’s account.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-09ol17">
       If the organization’s lien is not recognized by another jurisdiction, the organization may issue a decision, including a decision demanding repayment from the injured employee, of all benefits and compensation the organization has made on behalf of the injured employee, including costs and administrative fees.

   District court properly dismissed a claimant’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he did not meet the statutory requirements to file the appeal in the county in which the injury occurred or the county in which he resided, the Workforce Safety and Insurance had a statutory lien on the claimant’s third party recovery, and he did not pay any of the sums secured by the lien as statutorily required.

   This section does not regulate attorney fees payable by injured claimants on funds they recover due to the efforts of their private attorneys, or impose a legal obligation on private attorneys to follow the same procedure in calculating their attorney fees as the worker’s compensation bureau. Jones v. Pringle &amp; Herigstad, P.C., 546 N.W.2d 837, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where worker’s compensation claimant entered agreement for attorneys to represent her in action against third party tortfeasor, and the method of determining the attorneys’ fee was clearly set out in the agreement, the fact attorneys later entered a written agreement to represent the worker’s compensation bureau for its statutory subrogated interest for benefits when a claimant seeks recovery for injuries from third persons did not render the agreement between claimant and her attorneys ambiguous, and claimant was bound to pay the fee according to the terms of the agreement. Jones v. Pringle &amp; Herigstad, P.C., 546 N.W.2d 837, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where the attorney fully disclosed to the claimant that his fee would be one-third of the gross amount of the recovery from the third party, and the record showed there were difficult issues in the case, the case was time-consuming, and special expertise was required to perform the necessary legal services, the fee arrangement was not unreasonable. Disciplinary Bd. of the Supreme Court v. Dooley (In re Disciplinary Action Against Dooley), 1999 ND 184, 599 N.W.2d 619, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 1999).

   Co-employees retain their status as co-employees and their immunity from tort liability so long as they are acting in the course of their employment; the most satisfactory test to determine course of employment for purposes of co-employee immunity is the same course-of-employment test used to determine basic compensation coverage. Under that standard, in determining co-employee immunity, the test is whether the negligent co-employee would have been entitled to receive workers’ compensation benefits if that co-employee had been injured in the same incident. Mitchell v. Sanborn, 536 N.W.2d 678, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1995).

   In situations where an employer and a third-party tortfeasor both negligently cause an employee’s injuries, liability is imposed on the third-party tortfeasor for the negligence of the third party and the employer without permitting the third-party tortfeasor to get contribution from the employer.

   Employer’s related company was immune from liability in wrongful death action because decedent’s surviving spouse had received Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) benefits and for WSI exclusive remedy purposes, the employer and related company were the same entity as determined by the WSI under its authority of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-02" target="_self">65-01-02</a></cite>(22) and thus, the company was a contributing employer under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-08" target="_self">65-01-08</a></cite>.

   The 1949 amendment changing the bureau’s right of subrogation did not operate retrospectively and an employee who had elected under the prior law to receive workmen’s compensation had no right to bring action against third-party wrongdoer. Gimble v. Montana-Dakota Utils. Co., 77 N.D. 581, 44 N.W.2d 198, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1950) (1950) Contra Nelson v.

       </p>
       <p>

   Subrogation of compensation fund applies even though no compensation payments have been made and bureau may enforce subrogation by withholding payments that would otherwise be due. Breitwieser v. State, 62 N.W.2d 900, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 65</cite> (N.D. 1954).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where settlement is made under wrongful death law of another state and persons other than dependents are entitled to share in proceeds of settlement, compensation fund is subrogated only to extent to which beneficiaries of workers’ compensation act are entitled to share in proceeds as dependents. Breitwieser v. State, 62 N.W.2d 900, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 65</cite> (N.D. 1954).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workers’ compensation bureau was not entitled to subrogation as to sums paid or payable to surviving widow of deceased employee where the statute of limitations had expired as to widow’s claim against third parties for death of her husband before the widow or the bureau brought an action against the third parties. Ness v. St. Aloisius Hosp., 313 N.W.2d 781, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 364</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>

   The purpose of the bureau’s subrogation rights is to reimburse the fund, to the extent possible, at the expense of the persons at fault. Blaskowski v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 380 N.W.2d 333, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   In 1965 the legislature reduced the bureau’s right to subrogation of third-party recoveries from one-hundred percent to fifty percent. This change apparently was made to induce employees to bring actions against third parties who were at fault. An obvious result of this change was that the bureau received less subrogation from third-party recoveries. The bureau responded to this decreased subrogation by adopting policies that more thoroughly protected the remainder of its subrogation interest. Blaskowski v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 380 N.W.2d 333, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   The bureau does not automatically receive one-half of every recovery. It only receives one-half of a recovery if it pays benefits which add up to one-half of the recovery. Blaskowski v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 380 N.W.2d 333, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   Fact that the bureau failed to indicate its intention to suspend future benefits in its claimed subrogation interest prepared by the bureau for employee in preparation of trial against third party would not result in the bureau losing any right to suspend future benefits. The statute does not require the bureau to make predictions regarding possible future costs resulting from possible future claims which may or may not arise. Blaskowski v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 380 N.W.2d 333, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   The purpose of changing the language of the statute in 1981 from “paid or to be paid” to “it has paid or would otherwise pay in the future” was to clarify the language, and no substantive change was intended. An additional change made in 1981 was the addition of the clause: “The bureau’s subrogation interest may not be reduced by settlement, compromise, or judgment”. These two changes made statutory the bureau’s policies that were designed to ensure the bureau received its fifty percent subrogation interest. Blaskowski v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 380 N.W.2d 333, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   The subrogation rights of the bureau are statutory, and equitable concepts are, therefore, not controlling. State by Workmen's Compensation Bureau v. Clary, 389 N.W.2d 347, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 327</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   While equity may support plaintiff ’s contention that the subrogation interest of the bureau should be reduced by the percentage of negligence assigned to the employee by a jury in a trial against a third-party tort-feasor, the statute does not provide for such a reduction. State by Workmen's Compensation Bureau v. Clary, 389 N.W.2d 347, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 327</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   To construe this section so as to prevent the bureau from suspending future benefits would hinder the bureau’s efforts to enforce its subrogation rights and would be contrary to the intent of the legislature. Blaskowski v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 380 N.W.2d 333, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section unambiguously provides that the workers compensation bureau’s subrogation rights apply to the extent of fifty percent of the damages recovered, and neither permits nor requires the bureau’s subrogation interest to be further reduced when the recipient’s recovery from the third-party tortfeasor does not constitute a total recovery of the damages sustained by the recipient; the reason that a recipient secures only a partial recovery against the third-party tortfeasor is immaterial to the application of the bureau’s subrogation rights. Waith v. North Dakota's Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 409 N.W.2d 94, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 340</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   The workers compensation bureau should not receive a prorated subrogation interest when a benefit recipient recovers against a third-party tortfeasor less than the total damages sustained by the recipient because the tortfeasor, a political subdivision, is protected by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-12.1s32-12.1-03" target="_blank">32-12.1-03</a></cite> maximum liability limit.

       </p>
       <p>
        Neither N.D.C.C. § 32-03.2-02, nor this section, permits a reduction of the bureau’s subrogation rights because the claimant is unable to recover his full damages from all tortfeasors. Kavadas v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 466 N.W.2d 839, 1991 N.D. App. LEXIS 4 (N.D. Ct. App. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides the bureau with a statutory subrogation interest against “damages recovered” by an injured employee. In its calculation of damages recoverable under this section, the bureau included the interest a third party in a tort claim recovered on the damages, even though the section does not specifically include the word “interest.” Kavadas v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 466 N.W.2d 839, 1991 N.D. App. LEXIS 4 (N.D. Ct. App. 1991).

       Burden of proof in compensation matters — Death certificate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the organization or an employer claims an employee is not entitled to the benefits of the North Dakota workforce safety and insurance law because the employee’s injury was caused by the employee’s willful intention to cause self-injury, or to injure another, or by reason of the voluntary impairment caused by use of alcohol, recreational marijuana use, or illegal use of a controlled substance by the employee, the burden of proving the exemption or forfeiture is on the organization or on the person alleging the same; however, an alcohol concentration level at or above the limit set by the United States secretary of transportation in the Code of Federal Regulations in effect on August 1, 2011, or a level of an illegally used controlled substance or recreational marijuana sufficient to cause impairment found by a test conducted by a physician, qualified technician, chemist, or registered nurse at or above the cutoff level in the Code of Federal Regulations in effect on August 1, 2011, creates a rebuttable presumption the injury was due to impairment caused by the use of alcohol, recreational marijuana use, or the illegal use of a controlled substance. An employer who has a mandatory drug alcohol testing policy for work accidents, or an employer or a health care provider who has reasonable grounds to suspect an employee’s alleged work injury was caused by the employee’s voluntary impairment caused by use of alcohol, recreational marijuana use, or illegal use of a controlled substance may request the employee undergo testing to determine if the employee had alcohol, marijuana, or the controlled substance in the employee’s system at levels greater than the limit set by the United States department of transportation at the time of the injury. If an employee refuses to submit to a reasonable request to undergo a test to determine if the employee was impaired or if an employee refuses to submit to a test for drugs or alcohol after a work accident as mandated by company policy, the employee forfeits all entitlement to workforce safety and insurance benefits arising out of that injury. Any claimant against the fund, however, has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant is entitled to benefits. If a claim for death benefits is filed, the official death certificate must be considered as evidence of death and may not be used to establish the cause of death.

   One seeking an award from workers’ compensation bureau has burden of establishing by preponderance of evidence that injury for which he claims compensation was received in course of his employment. Oberg v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 57 N.D. 189, 220 N.W. 923, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1928); Sandlie v.

   Claimant against the North Dakota workers’ compensation fund has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the existence of an injury for which she is entitled to participate in the fund. Roberts v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 326 N.W.2d 702, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 389</cite> (N.D. 1982).

   This section provides that the burden of proof shifts to the bureau in cases in which the employee’s voluntary intoxication is the cause of the employee’s injury, and does not require the burden of proof to shift when the alleged injury is itself alcoholism. Darnell v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 450 N.W.2d 721, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1990).

   This section generally requires the claimant to prove a compensable injury by a preponderance of evidence in order to participate in the fund. However, the bureau has the burden of proof if it claims that an employee is not entitled to benefits because of the employee’s willful intent to injure himself or the employee’s voluntary intoxication. Darnell v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 450 N.W.2d 721, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workers’ Compensation Bureau’s finding that claimant failed to prove that her current condition was related to a prior work injury was supported by a preponderance of the evidence; the bureau was responsible for weighing the credibility of medical evidence and in doing so explained why it gave more weight to their medical examiner’s opinion. Otto v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 533 N.W.2d 703, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>

   Because the Bureau relied on parts of a independent medical examination report favorable to its decision and ignored parts of the report unfavorable to its decision, the Bureau’s decision was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence and the judgment was reversed and the case remanded to the Bureau for further proceedings to clarify the discrepancies in the independent medical examination report. Negaard-Cooley v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 122, 611 N.W.2d 898, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 2000).

   Claimant has the burden of proving his right to participate in compensation benefits by showing that he was actually injured in the course of employment and that the ensuing disability is causally connected to the employment injury; compensation award cannot be made on surmise, conjecture or mere guess. Inglis v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 312 N.W.2d 318, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 405</cite> (N.D. 1981).

   A claimant of compensation benefits has the burden to prove that he or she was actually injured in the course of employment and that the ensuing disability is causally connected to the employment injury. Robert v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 321 N.W.2d 501, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 290</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   Claimant of compensation benefits has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is entitled to participate in the benefits available from the fund; such claimant must establish that the injury was incurred in the course of employment and that the disability is causally connected to the employment injury. Reynolds v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 328 N.W.2d 247, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 402</cite> (N.D. 1982).

   Claimant had the burden of proving that his July 1985 head injury was related to his April 1986 headaches and hospitalization. Howes v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 429 N.W.2d 730, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1014, 109 S. Ct. 1126, 103 L.

   If the bureau terminates benefits, after initially accepting a claim and paying benefits, the claimant has the burden of proving his or her right to continue receiving benefits. Howes v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 429 N.W.2d 730, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1014, 109 S. Ct. 1126, 103 L.

   Where the worker’s treating physician, a second physician and a physical therapist concluded that the worker’s injury-related work restrictions did not preclude him from working altogether, but a third physician offered a conflicting medical opinion as to his ability to work, the worker did not meet his burden of establishing entitlement to disability benefits. Boger v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 192, 600 N.W.2d 877, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court was correct in upholding the Workers Compensation Bureau’s order denying the claimant’s reapplication for temporary total disability benefits; the claimant was unable to prove actual wage loss, which was a prerequisite to reinstating discontinued disability benefits.

   Where competent evidence traces a causal connection between an affliction from which a workman was suffering and the accident, or shows that the accident either caused or accelerated the effect of such affliction, that is sufficient to establish a claim against the fund, but recovery cannot be allowed upon pure speculation. Kuntz v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 139 N.W.2d 525, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 197</cite> (N.D. 1966).

   Employee’s workers compensation claim for a back condition was properly denied because there was no showing by a preponderance of the evidence that her job was a substantial contributing factor to her injury where the objective medical findings established that the employee had been suffering from a pre-existing back injury from a car accident since 1992. Myhre v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2002 ND 186, 653 N.W.2d 705, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 239</cite> (N.D. 2002).

   Where Workforce Safety and Insurance denied a wife’s claim because she failed to show that asbestos exposure was a primary or direct cause of her husband’s lung cancer, WSI committed error because it did not analyze the evidence in light of the substantial contributing factor standard. It was possible that the husband’s smoking and the asbestos exposure were both substantial contributing factors in the husband’s lung cancer and testimony from the treating physician raised the question of whether the occupational exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor in the development of his lung cancer. Manske v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2008 ND 79, 748 N.W.2d 394, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 2008).

   North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance properly denied the claimant medical benefits for his right vertebral artery occlusion because the preponderance of the evidence established that the condition was not causally related to his work injury. Brockel v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp;

   Co-employees retain their status as co-employees and their immunity from tort liability so long as they are acting in the course of their employment; the most satisfactory test to determine course of employment for purposes of co-employee immunity is the same course-of-employment test used to determine basic compensation coverage. Under that standard, in determining co-employee immunity, the test is whether the negligent co-employee would have been entitled to receive workers’ compensation benefits if that co-employee had been injured in the same incident.

   Claimant had the burden of proving that her injury occurred during the course of her employment, and in view of inconsistencies in her claim and testimony which substantiated the bureau’s findings of a lack of credibility, as well as evidence of her prior medical history, a reasoning mind could have reasonably concluded that she failed to prove that her injuries arose out of and in the course of her employment.

   Court did not err in denying a claimant’s reapplication for worker’s compensation benefits where a doctor’s opinion that he was totally disabled from working in July 2002 did not prove that he was similarly disabled six months earlier when he quit his job in January 2002, or that a change in his medical condition caused him to leave his employment.

   Employee did not prove that he suffered a compensable work related injury because the employee had symptoms consistent with a disc herniation before the claimed date of injury, and he was engaged in non-work activities that could have caused or contributed to the disc herniation. An expert testified the events and activities noted in the employee’s medical records, such as playing football or laying carpet, could have caused a disc condition to become more symptomatic.

Absent such evidence, the bureau reasonably concluded that the greater weight of the evidence indicated that he had not suffered a loss of earning capacity, and the bureau’s denial of temporary partial disability benefits was affirmed.

   Reasoning mind could have found that the claimant failed to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the claimant’s right shoulder pain was substantially accelerated or substantially worsened by the claimant’s work injury and vocational training, which meant that the claimant did not have a

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-11" target="_self">65-01-11</a></cite> compensable injury. The injury was not compensable because

   The drafters of this section did not prohibit application of the statute based on the date of injury or specify another basis for being “subject to” the statute; therefore, cases falling under this section will follow the precedent that unless otherwise provided, the statutes in effect on the date of an injury govern workers’ compensation benefits.

     </h3>
     <ol>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-15.1ol11">
       Any condition or impairment of health of a full-time paid firefighter or law enforcement officer caused by lung or respiratory disease, hypertension, heart disease, or an exposure to a bloodborne pathogen as defined by section 23-07.5-01 occurring in the course of employment, or occupational cancer in a full-time paid firefighter, is presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty. The presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence the condition or impairment is not work-related.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-15.1ol12">
       As used in this section, an occupational cancer is one which arises out of employment as a full-time paid firefighter and is due to injury due to exposure to smoke, fumes, or carcinogenic, poisonous, toxic, or chemical substances while in the performance of active duty as a full-time paid firefighter.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-15.1ol13">
       A full-time paid firefighter or law enforcement officer is not eligible for the benefit provided under this section unless that full-time paid firefighter or law enforcement officer has completed five years of continuous service and has successfully passed a medical examination which fails to reveal any evidence of such a condition. An employer shall require a medical examination upon employment, for any employee subject to this section. After the initial medical examination, an employer shall require at least a periodic medical examination as follows: for one to ten years of service, every five years; for eleven to twenty years of service, every three years; and for twenty-one or more years of service, every year. The periodic medical examination, at a minimum, must consist of a general medical history of the individual and the individual’s family; an occupational history including contact with and an exposure to hazardous materials, toxic products, contagious and infectious diseases, and to physical hazards; a physical examination including measurement of height, weight, and blood pressure; and laboratory and diagnostic procedures including a nonfasting total blood cholesterol test. If the medical examination reveals that an employee falls into a recognized risk group, the employee must be referred to a qualified health professional for future medical examination. If a medical examination produces a false positive result for a condition covered under this section, the organization shall consider the condition to be a compensable injury. In the case of a false positive result, neither the coverage of the condition nor the period of disability may exceed fifty-six days. This section does not affect an employee’s responsibility to document that the employee has not used tobacco as required under section 65-01-15. Results of the examination must be used in rebuttal to a presumption afforded under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-15.1ol14">
       For purposes of this section, “law enforcement officer” means a person who is licensed to perform peace officer law enforcement duties under chapter 12-63 and is employed full time by the bureau of criminal investigation, the game and fish department, the state highway patrol, the parole and probation division, the North Dakota state university police department, the North Dakota state college of science police department, the university of North Dakota police department, a county sheriff’s department, a city police department, or the parks and recreation department pursuant to section 55-08-04.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-01s65-01-15.1ol15">
       The presumption does not include a condition or impairment of health of a full-time paid firefighter or law enforcement officer, who has been employed for ten years or less, if the condition or impairment is diagnosed more than two years after the employment as a full-time paid firefighter or law enforcement officer ends. The presumption also does not include a condition or impairment of health of a full-time paid firefighter or law enforcement officer, who has been employed more than ten years, if the condition or impairment is diagnosed more than five years after the employment as a full-time paid firefighter or law enforcement officer ends.

   On remand following an appeal in a worker’s compensation matter, an administrative law judge did not err in conducting a de novo evidentiary hearing.

   Appellate court reversed trial court’s judgment directing the North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau to award benefits to claimant and instead directed that the case be remanded for reconsideration and rehearing where ex-parte communications took place between the Bureau’s outside counsel and the Bureau and its in-house counsel.

   Former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-14" target="_self">65-01-14</a></cite> outlined the procedure when a claim for benefits or reapplication for benefits was made under this title, and contemplated a “notice of decision” when a final determination was made on a claim or on a reapplication; it would have been absurd to require the bureau to issue a “notice of decision” every time the bureau conducted any investigation or review of a claimant’s file.

     <p>
      For purposes of the agricultural service exception to hazardous employment under section 65-01-02, an agricultural employer that engages in a custom agricultural operation, which is the planting, care, or harvesting of grain or field crops on a contract-for-hire basis, exclusive of hauling by special contractor, retains the exemption unless the employer’s custom agricultural operations are based outside this state or require more than thirty actual working days of operation during the calendar year.

       Alternative dispute resolution — Pilot program — Continuing appropriation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the organization may develop and implement pilot programs to allow the organization to assess alternative forms of dispute resolution to resolve disputes with injured employees. The goal of the pilot program must be to develop timely, cost-effective, and amicable options to resolve disputes during any stage in the claim adjudication or appeal process. A pilot program may address a broad range of approaches, including collaborative efforts between the organization and other public or private entities. Participation of an injured employee in the pilot program is voluntary. No more than fifty thousand dollars per biennium from the workforce safety and insurance fund is appropriated to the organization on a continuing basis for payment of organization expenses associated with the pilot program.

   Entire executive control of administration of functions of bureau is vested in commissioners and this executive control is extended to any litigation that bureau may have, so that attorney general has no power to compromise claims without consent of bureau. Robinson v. State, 63 N.W.2d 521, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 1954).

         Removal of Commissioner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Governor may remove a commissioner of workers’ compensation bureau who carries on private law practice in addition to his duties at bureau. State ex rel. Wehe v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 46 N.D. 147, 180 N.W. 49, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>

   It is essential in order to confer jurisdiction on governor for removal of a commissioner, that hearing be had where accused may know nature of charges against him, may cross-examine witnesses, and may produce testimony to disprove charges. State ex rel. Wehe v. Frazier, 47 N.D. 314, 182 N.W. 545, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>

   Governor, in exercising power of removal over a commissioner, acts in quasi-judicial capacity pursuant to legislative limitations, and must exercise legal discretion in addition to an executive discretion. State ex rel. Wehe v. Frazier, 47 N.D. 314, 182 N.W. 545, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where governor fails to accord to a commissioner a hearing on his removal and where commissioner refuses to be sworn as witness unless such hearing is accorded, there is no jurisdiction to order removal. State ex rel. Wehe v. Frazier, 47 N.D. 314, 182 N.W. 545, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 1921).

   Workers compensation bureau is not a legal entity subject to suit, but suit against bureau in legal effect is suit against state. Watland v. North Dakota Workmen’s Comp. Bureau, 58 N.D. 303, 225 N.W. 812 (1929), overruled on other grounds, Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr. Co., 521 N.W.2d 632 (N.D. 1994), explained, Henderson v.

      The legislative council may delete, where appropriate, “workers compensation bureau”, “North Dakota workers compensation bureau”, or any derivatives of those terms, which when used in context indicate an intention to refer to those terms, wherever they appear in the North Dakota Century Code or in the supplements thereto and to insert in lieu of each deletion “workforce safety and insurance”. Such changes are to be made when any volume or supplement of the North Dakota Century Code is being reprinted. It is the intent of the legislative assembly that workforce safety and insurance be substituted for, shall take any action previously to be taken by, and shall perform any duties previously to be performed by the workers compensation bureau. The legislative council may replace “bureau”, where appropriate, wherever the term appears in the North Dakota Century Code or in the supplements of the North Dakota Century Code, with the term “organization”. These changes are to be made when any volume or supplement is being reprinted.

   This section, which authorizes the workers compensation bureau to promulgate and enforce rules, does not relieve the bureau of responsibility for compliance with the Administrative Agencies Practices Act in establishing those rules, including fee schedules. Johnson v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 428 N.W.2d 514, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 1988), limited, Traynor Law Firm v.

   The phrase “attorney’s fee” as used in this section refers to expenses incurred for the services of an attorney. Howes v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 429 N.W.2d 730, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1014, 109 S. Ct. 1126, 103 L. Ed. 2d 189, 1989 U.S. LEXIS 904 (U.S. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section prevented the claimant’s attorney from seeking fees from the claimant and from otherwise seeking more than what was provided in the workers compensation bureau’s schedule of fees. Johnson v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 428 N.W.2d 514, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 1988), limited, Traynor Law Firm v. State, 2020 ND 108, 943 N.W.2d 320, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 107</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>

   Record of workers compensation bureau’s rulemaking proceeding was adequate under the Administrative Agencies Practice Act, and its promulgation of maximum hourly compensation rates for claimant’s attorney’s fees and fee caps was not an arbitrary or capricious application of its statutory authority. Little v. Traynor, 1997 ND 128, 565 N.W.2d 766, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Attorney who executed a notice of legal representation which provided that attorney’s sole remuneration for representing client before the Workers Compensation Bureau would be paid by the Bureau and who billed client after unilaterally terminating his representation committed a knowing violation of Prof. Conduct Rule 1.5(a), warranting a thirty day suspension from the practice of law and an assessment of all costs of the disciplinary proceeding. Disciplinary Bd. v. Moe, 1999 ND 110, 594 N.W.2d 317, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 98</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>

   The ambiguous language of this section must be construed to further its purpose of assisting injured workers in hiring and paying for competent representation, therefore, the statute only prohibits an attorney from receiving double fees from the client and the Bureau for legal services rendered to an injured employee; it does not prohibit an injured employee from entering a fee agreement with an attorney and then, upon prevailing in the case, seeking full or partial reimbursement from the Bureau, in the amount of the fees allowed under the statute. Ash v. Traynor, 2000 ND 75, 609 N.W.2d 96, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D. 2000).

The Supreme Court of North Dakota concludes a prevailing injured employee is entitled to attorney’s fees in actions against Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-02s65-02-08" target="_self">65-02-08</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-10s65-10-03" target="_self">65-10-03</a></cite> up to the statutory limit, but when WSI denies or reduces the employee’s benefits without substantial justification, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_blank">28-32-50</a></cite> may be applied to award the employee reasonable attorney’s fees.

   N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-02s65-02-08" target="_self">65-02-08</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-10s65-10-03" target="_self">65-10-03</a></cite> guarantee an automatic award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party, but N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_blank">28-32-50</a></cite> requires the party to not only prevail but also requires proof that the agency acted without substantial justification; the language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_blank">28-32-50</a></cite> is expansive and inclusive, and does not exclude actions against WSI. The Supreme Court of North Dakota concludes these statutes are not irreconcilable and apply in different situations, and therefore can be harmonized.

   Rojas v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2006 ND 221, 723 N.W.2d 403, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>

   Trial court erred in affirming the decision of Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance (WSI) to pay a claimant only $9,876 for costs and attorney’s fees after he won his appeal to have his benefits reinstated, based upon the maximum amount WSI could pay under the fee cap in N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-02s65-02-08" target="_self">65-02-08</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-10s65-10-03" target="_self">65-10-03</a></cite>, because the general attorney fee provision for administrative actions, N.D.C.C.§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_blank">28-32-50</a></cite>, could apply to WSI cases where the claimant alleged that WSI acted without substantial justification in reducing or denying benefits. Therefore, the case was remanded for a determination as to whether the WSI acted without substantial justification warranting an additional award of attorney’s fees under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_blank">28-32-50</a></cite>.

   Bureau exceeded its statutory authority by denying a claimant attorney fees for representation before the bureau on his request for a lump sum settlement on the ground that his claim had not been “denied or reduced” under an administrative regulation adopted by the bureau. Moore v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 374 N.W.2d 71, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 388</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>

   Section provides that the bureau shall pay a claimant’s attorney fees incurred “in proceedings before the bureau…”.The statute does not differentiate between types of proceedings in which attorney fees are authorized, nor can it be interpreted to limit the claimant’s right to attorney fees to situations in which the bureau has either “denied or reduced” a claim.

     <p>
      Except as otherwise provided by this title, process and procedure under this title is governed by chapter 28-32. The organization may make investigation as in its judgment is best calculated to ascertain the substantial rights of all the parties. Any member of the organization and any person specifically designated by the organization may examine witnesses and records, with or without subpoena, examine, investigate, copy, photograph, and take samples at any pertinent location or facility, administer oaths to witnesses, require the attendance of witnesses without fee whenever the testimony is taken at the home, office, or place of work of those witnesses, and generally to do anything necessary to facilitate or promote the efficient administration of this title. The organization may issue a subpoena to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, and any other records deemed necessary by the organization. Subpoenas may be enforced by applying to a judge of the district court for an order requiring the attendance of a witness, the production of all documents and objects described in the subpoena, or otherwise enforcing an order. Failure to comply with the order of the district court is contempt as provided in chapter 27-10. The organization shall pay the costs of any medical examination, scientific investigation, medical or expert witness appearance or report, requested or approved by the organization, relating to a claim for benefits, from the organization’s general fund.

   Administrative law judge’s (ALJ) decision that plaintiff was unable to return to his pre-injury employment would be deemed a recommendation, where record did not show workers compensation bureau’s request for ALJ to preside over proceeding asked ALJ to issue final order.

   Where the Workers Compensation Bureau requested a hearing officer to issue recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law with regard to whether the claimant was entitled to a higher permanent partial impairment award, the officer’s decision was a recommendation, not a final order.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The organization shall establish a managed care program, including utilization review and bill review, to effect the best medical solution for an injured employee in a cost-effective manner upon a finding by the organization that the employee suffered a compensable injury. The program shall operate according to guidelines adopted by the organization and shall provide for medical management of claims within the bounds of workforce safety and insurance law. Information compiled and analysis performed pursuant to a managed care program which relate to patterns of treatment, cost, or outcomes by health care providers and allied health care professionals are confidential and are not open to public inspection to the extent the information and analysis identify a specific health care provider or allied health care professional, except to the specific health care provider, allied health care professional, organization employees, or persons rendering assistance to the organization in the administration of this title. If an employee, employer, or allied health care professional disputes a managed care decision, the employee, employer, or allied health care professional shall request binding dispute resolution on the decision. The organization shall make rules providing for the procedures for dispute resolution. Dispute resolution under this section is not subject to chapter 28-32 or section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-16" target="_self">65-01-16</a></cite>. A dispute resolution decision under this section requested by an allied health care professional concerning payment for medical treatment already provided or a request for diagnostic tests or treatment is not reviewable by any court. A dispute resolution decision under this section requested by an employee is reviewable by a court only if medical treatment has been denied to the employee. A dispute resolution decision under this section requested by an employer is reviewable by a court only if medical treatment is awarded to the employee. The dispute resolution decision may be reversed only if the court finds an abuse of discretion in the dispute resolution process. Any person providing binding dispute resolution services under this section is exempt from civil liability relating to the binding dispute resolution process and decision.

   Workers’ compensation claimant’s due process rights were not violated because the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance Fund (WSI) was not required to provide a trial type proceeding for a dispute resolution regarding a prosthetic device.

       <p>

   Workers’ compensation claimant’s due process rights were not violated by the denial of a requested prosthetic device because he had no protectable property interest in receiving one prosthetic device over another; there was no termination of benefits that occurred, and the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance Fund (WSI), through binding dispute resolution, decided the best medical solution in a cost-effective manner.

   The resolution procedures for disputes of managed care recommendations became effective only for disputes that occurred after the adoption of administrative rules providing these procedures; these rules were adopted effective January 1, 1994, and did not apply to recommendations of the managed care administrator to deny payments occurring before that date.

   Where the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) sent claimant a letter denying her request to increase the level of reimbursement for her home health care services, the letter was not an appealable decision under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-02s65-02-20" target="_self">65-02-20</a></cite> and claimant did not appeal the subsequent decision of WSI’s binding dispute resolution (BDR) program. Therefore, the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review WSI’s decision, and the district court’s judgment affirming the BDR decision was void.

       <p>

   District court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to review the binding dispute resolution decision by North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance to deny payment for a myoelectric-powered prosthesis recommended for the injured worker because the request for binding dispute resolution was made by the injured worker’s medical provider and not the injured worker, and the medical provider could not have been acting on the injured worker’s behalf because the medical provider was not a licensed North Dakota lawyer.

   In a workers’ compensation case, it was not an abuse of discretion for the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance Fund (WSI) to deny a claimant’s request for a myoelectric prosthesis during binding dispute resolution because the WSI was not required to provide the claimant’s preferred device; it considered each device’s durability, cost, and impact on the amputation injuries suffered.

      The organization’s decision review office is established. The decision review office is independent of the claims department of the organization and activities administered through the office must be administered in accordance with this title. The decision review office shall provide assistance to an injured employee who has filed a claim, which may include acting on behalf of an injured employee who is aggrieved by a decision of the organization, communicating with organization staff regarding claim dispute resolution, and informing an injured employee of the effect of decisions made by the organization, an injured employee, or an employer under this title. The organization shall employ a director of the decision review office and other personnel determined to be necessary for the administration of the office. An individual employed to administer the decision review office may not act as an attorney for an injured employee. The organization may not pay attorney’s fees to an attorney who represents an injured employee in a disputed claim before the organization unless the injured employee has first attempted to resolve the dispute through the decision review office. A written request for assistance by an injured employee who contacts the decision review office within the period for requesting a hearing on an administrative order tolls the time period for requesting a hearing on that order. The period begins upon notice to the injured employee, sent by regular mail, that the decision review office’s assistance to the injured employee is completed. The information contained in a file established by the decision review office on an injured employee’s disputed claim, including communications from an injured employee, is privileged and may not be released without the injured employee’s permission. Information in the file containing the notes or mental impressions of decision review office staff is confidential and may not be released by the decision review office.

      Once every four years, the director shall request the state auditor to select a firm with extensive expertise in workers’ compensation practices and standards to complete a performance evaluation of the functions and operations of the organization during that evaluation period. This may not be construed to require the firm to be a certified public accounting firm. The firm’s report must contain recommendations for departmental improvement or an explanation of why no recommendations are being made. The director or the director’s designee, the chairman of the board or the chairman’s designee, and a representative of the firm shall present the evaluation report and any action taken to the legislative management’s workers’ compensation review committee and to the governor. The director shall provide a copy of the performance evaluation report to the state auditor. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the workers’ compensation review committee may select no more than four elements to be evaluated in the performance evaluation and shall inform the state auditor of the selected items to be evaluated. The state auditor shall include the elements selected by the committee in the performance evaluation, but the state auditor may select additional elements to be evaluated. The total number of elements, including those selected by the workers’ compensation review committee, may not exceed eight. In exceptional circumstances, the state auditor may include more than eight elements for evaluation. If more than eight elements are selected, the state auditor shall report to the workers’ compensation review committee the additional elements selected and the exceptional circumstances to support the inclusion of the additional elements. Money in the workforce safety and insurance fund is appropriated on a continuing basis for the payment of the expense of conducting the performance evaluation. The organization shall develop and maintain comprehensive, objective performance measurements. These measurements may be evaluated as part of the independent performance evaluation under this section.

   Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) did not err in refusing to create a new rate classification for an assisted living retirement facility or for resident service aides employed therein for the purpose of establishing their employer’s insurance premiums because N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-01" target="_self">65-04-01</a></cite> did not require WSI to adjudicate individual contested claims at the lowest possible scheduled rate and any claim for the creation of new classifications or rates had to be made in the context of the actuarial process.

   Classification by Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) of resident service aides employed in an assisted living retirement facility as “9002 Domestics” with a designated rate of 3.31 for purposes of establishing the employer’s insurance premiums was affirmed because a reasoning mind could have reasonably concluded that resident service aides spent about 75 percent of their time on domestic type duties that fit within the description of “9002 Domestics” in WSI’s Classification Manual, WSI’s findings were supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and its findings supported its conclusions of law and decision.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The employer shall reimburse the organization for all medical expenses related to a compensable injury to an employee if the expenses do not exceed two hundred fifty dollars and shall reimburse the organization for the first two hundred fifty dollars of medical expenses when the expenses exceed two hundred fifty dollars. If a claim for benefits is filed with the organization by midnight central time on the first business day following the workplace injury, the organization shall pay the first two hundred fifty dollars of medical expenses. A claim is filed by submitting a form furnished by the organization or by another method designated by the organization. If a claim for benefits is filed with the organization more than fourteen days from the date the employer received notice of the workplace injury from the employee, the employer shall reimburse the organization for the first three hundred fifty dollars of medical expenses if the expenses exceed three hundred fifty dollars. If the organization determines the claim is compensable, the organization shall pay the medical expenses associated with the claim and notify the employer of payments to be made by the employer under this section. If the employer does not pay the organization within thirty days of notice by the organization, the organization may impose a penalty on that employer. The penalty may not exceed one hundred twenty-five percent of the payment owed by the employer. The organization shall collect the penalty in a civil action against the employer and deposit the money in the fund. An employer may not directly or indirectly charge an injured employee for any payment the employer makes on a claim. Except as otherwise provided, if the cost of an injured employee’s medical treatment exceeds two hundred fifty dollars, the organization shall pay all further medical expenses. This section is effective for all compensable injuries that occur after July 31, 1995. This section does not apply to compensable injuries paid under sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-06.2s65-06.2-04" target="_self">65-06.2-04</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-06.2s65-06.2-08" target="_self">65-06.2-08</a></cite>.

       Retrospective rating program.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The organization may establish a program to provide retrospective rating. The organization may not require an employer to participate in the program, but it may refuse to allow an employer to participate when it determines that refusal is appropriate. The organization shall establish formulas, based on sound actuarial principles, for premium calculation under the program. Sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-01" target="_self">65-04-01</a></cite>, <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-04" target="_self">65-04-04</a></cite>, and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-04.2" target="_self">65-04-04.2</a></cite> do not apply to retrospective premiums allowed under this section. Any moneys held by the organization for future claim payments must accrue interest at a reasonable rate as determined by the organization. The organization may execute a contract with an employer to establish a retrospective rating plan for that employer. The contract is binding on the employer and the organization for the term identified in the contract. The term identified in the contract may extend past the end of the biennium in which the contract is executed but the term may not exceed ten years. The organization shall determine the amount of the deposit premium to be paid by an employer participating in the program. The amount of the deposit premium must be based on current rates, payroll, and experience rate factors. The organization shall establish the maximum premium liability of a participating employer. The maximum premium is not subject to the limitations of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-17" target="_self">65-04-17</a></cite>. The organization may provide refunds from the workforce safety and insurance fund when it is determined appropriate under the retrospective rating formula established. The organization shall provide any refund due within thirty days after the date of the retrospective premium valuation. The organization may impose a penalty if an employer fails to pay additional premium due within thirty days after the retrospective premium valuation. The organization may require an employer to provide a bond, letter of credit, or other security approved by the organization to guarantee payment of future employer obligations incurred by a retrospective rating plan.

   A second or subsequent injury fund protects employees because it provides full compensation to a previously impaired worker who suffers a subsequent work injury by apportioning claim expenses between the current employer’s experience rating and the fund, and it encourages employers to hire previously impaired employees because the apportionment scheme charges an employer’s experience rating only for injuries attributable to the employer’s work environment.

   District court did not err in affirming the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) reversing the North Dakota Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance’s decision imposing derivative premium liability on the construction company for unpaid premiums due from one of its subcontractors because the ALJ’s finding that the payments from the construction company to the subcontractor were not reliable evidence to establish premium liability was supported by the record as the payments and their corresponding notations did not provide information to establish that the subcontractor expended money to employ workers; and, the fact that the subcontractor could not have completed all of the work by himself did not definitively established he had employees.

     <p>
      The claim of the organization in bankruptcy, probate, insolvency, and receivership proceedings for premiums in default and penalties is a lien with the same priority as prior income tax liens, except that this lien is not enforceable against a purchaser, including a lien creditor, of real estate or personal property for valuable consideration without notice. Notice of this lien must be filed in the place and manner provided for in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-38s57-38-49" target="_blank">57-38-49</a></cite>. A certificate of the organization that premiums and penalties are due for the period stated in the certificate is prima facie evidence of this fact. In any action brought for the recovery of premiums in default and penalties, the remedies of garnishment or attachment, or both, are available. No exemptions except absolute exemptions under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-22s28-22-02" target="_blank">28-22-02</a></cite> may be allowed against any levy under execution pursuant to judgment recovered in the action.

   Initiation of an action by the bureau against a corporation for unpaid workers’ compensation insurance premiums does not constitute an election of remedies precluding the bureau from seeking payment of the unpaid premiums from the individual corporate officers and directors.

       <p>

   Because under this section, the personal liability of corporate officers and directors survives dissolution, reorganization, or bankruptcy of the corporation, where the bureau believes that a corporate entity is now defunct and attempts to collect workers compensation insurance premiums would be futile, the bureau has no statutory requirement to first attempt to settle its claim with the corporation.

       An individual employed by a subcontractor or by an independent contractor operating under an agreement with a general contractor is deemed to be an employee of the general contractor and any subcontractor that supplied work to the subcontractor or independent contractor. A general contractor and a subcontractor are liable for payment of premium and any applicable penalty for an employee of a subcontractor or independent contractor that does not secure required coverage or pay the premium owing. The general contractor and a subcontractor are liable for payment of this premium and penalty until the subcontractor or independent contractor pays this premium and penalty. The liability imposed on a general contractor and a subcontractor under this section for the payment of premium and penalties under this title which are not paid by a subcontractor or independent contractor is limited to work performed under that general contractor.

If a subcontractor’s or independent contractor’s liability for failure to secure coverage or pay the premium owing arises from a single project with a general contractor, the liability of the general contractor and subcontractor is one hundred percent of the amount of premium and penalty owed by the subcontractor or independent contractor. If there is evidence showing the subcontractor or independent contractor was working on multiple projects during the period the subcontractor or independent contractor failed to secure coverage, the organization shall set the amount of the general contractor and subcontractor’s liability which may not exceed seventy percent of the total premium and penalty owed by the subcontractor or independent contractor.

   While the district court erred in dismissing a cross-appeal by Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance (WSI) cross-appeal as untimely, it properly affirmed a determination by an administrative law judge holding a contractor liable for unpaid workers compensation premiums and penalties attributed to a subcontractor’s account and that the contractor’s principal was personally liable for unpaid workers compensation premiums because the imposition of derivative liability was statutorily allowed against a general contractor without proof the underling assessment of liability against a subcontractor was final, and, in the absence of adequate payroll records, WSI appropriately calculated the amount of the late premiums. Brendel Constr., Inc. v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2021 ND 3, 953 N.W.2d 612, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 2021).

   District court did not err in affirming the decision of an administrative law judge (ALJ) reversing the North Dakota Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance’s decision imposing derivative premium liability on the construction company for unpaid premiums due from one of its subcontractors because the ALJ’s finding that the payments from the construction company to the subcontractor were not reliable evidence to establish premium liability was supported by the record as the payments and their corresponding notations did not provide information to establish that the subcontractor expended money to employ workers; and the fact that the subcontractor could not have completed all of the work by himself did not definitively established he had employees.

      The payment of a judgment rendered in an action brought against an employer for the collection of defaulted premiums or the voluntary payment of the amount of premium, penalties, and costs prior to judgment entitles the employer and that employer’s employees to the benefits provided in this title from the date of the payment. The organization shall pay an employee who sustains an injury while working for an employer whose premium is in default the same as the employee would receive if the employee were working for an employer whose premium is not in default.

   Generally, when an employer complies with the workers’ compensation statutes, the employee’s exclusive remedy against the employer is limited to recovery under the workers’ compensation statutes. Barsness v. General Diesel &amp; Equip. Co., 422 N.W.2d 819, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   Third-party indemnity and contribution action for fraud and deceit against employer was barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. Smith v. Vestal, 494 N.W.2d 370, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   Injured employee had a right to bring a tort action against an employer for personal injuries which the employee suffered while working for the employer, which incorrectly classified the employee as an independent contractor, because the exclusive remedy provisions of the North Dakota workers' compensation laws did not preclude the action under provisions authorizing the action for the employer willfully misrepresenting to an insurer the amount of payroll upon which a premium was based, or for willfully failing to secure coverage for employees. Vail v. S/L Servs., 2017 ND 202, 900 N.W.2d 271, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 2017).

       <p>

   District court did not err in dismissing an employee’s negligence action because an employee and coworker were immune from suit under the Workforce Safety and Insurance Act’s exclusive remedy provisions; the determinations in California administrative proceedings were irrelevant for deciding statutory immunity because the employer paid Workforce Safety and Insurance premiums to secure coverage on the employee’s behalf, and the employee received benefits throughout the California proceedings. Brock v. Price, 2019 ND 240, 934 N.W.2d 5, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   In situations where an employer and a third-party tortfeasor both negligently cause an employee’s injuries, liability is imposed on the third-party tortfeasor for the negligence of the third party and the employer without permitting the third-party tortfeasor to get contribution from the employer.

        The operation of the joint and several liability provision of former N.D.C.C. § 9-10-07 and the immunity provision of this section rendered the joint tortfeasor liable for the negligence of the immune employers, as well as its own negligence.

   The exclusive remedy rule prohibiting a third-party tortfeasor from getting contribution from the employer does not prohibit enforcement of an employer’s contractual agreement to indemnify a third-party tortfeasor.

   Where employee is injured in the course of his employment and at the time of the injury the employer is uninsured for workers’ compensation coverage, and where the injured employee has not been awarded workers’ compensation benefits under former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-09s65-09-03" target="_self">65-09-03</a></cite>, such employee’s option under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-09s65-09-02" target="_self">65-09-02</a></cite> to pursue a civil action against the employer is not negated by fact that employer, subsequent to the injury, has paid the premiums, penalties and interest required by this section. Shaughnessy v. Bohnet, 303 N.W.2d 337, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>

   Injured employee had a right to bring a tort action against an employer for personal injuries which the employee suffered while working for the employer, which incorrectly classified the employee as an independent contractor, because the exclusive remedy provisions of the North Dakota workers' compensation laws did not preclude the action under provisions authorizing the action for the employer willfully misrepresenting to an insurer the amount of payroll upon which a premium was based, or for willfully failing to secure coverage for employees. Vail v. S/L Servs., 2017 ND 202, 900 N.W.2d 271, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 2017).

   The statutory references to insurance in the workers’ compensation laws do not make the protections provided by a workers’ compensation board into insurance as contemplated in N.D.C.C. ch. 26.1-42, governing the guaranty association. The funds provided by the workers’ compensation board are not insurance; they are workers’ compensation, and are derived from a statutorily created scheme designed to protect workers injured in the course of their employment. Beyer's Cement v. North Dakota Ins. Guar. Ass'n, 417 N.W.2d 370, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 454</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>

   Failure to notify the workers compensation bureau of intention to hire employees, as required by this section, did not constitute a failure of the employer to be insured as provided by former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-12" target="_self">65-04-12</a></cite>, and create a civil remedy under

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-33" target="_self">65-04-33</a></cite>(1) does not impose an ongoing obligation on employers to report every day-to-day fluctuation in their number of employees during a premium period, because premium adjustments are made on an annual basis. Carlson v. GMR Transp., Inc., 2015 ND 121, 863 N.W.2d 514, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>

   Employer was entitled to supervisory writs directing a district court to grant the employer summary judgment barring civil liability for deceased and injured workers’ injuries because no fact question existed as to whether an exception to the employer’s immunity due to the employer reporting an inaccurate payroll to Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) applied, as WSI (1) found no such violation, (2) did not try to collect additional premiums, and (3) gave no notice that WSI processed the workers’ claims under N.D.C.C. ch. 65-09.

   In a case in which an individual appealed a district court’s affirmation of an administrative law judge’s (ALJ) finding, the ALJ correctly determined that the individual was an employer under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-02" target="_self">65-01-02</a></cite>(17) and that the individual was aware workers’

   compensation coverage was required for all employees and that he intentionally tried to avoid the responsibility to provide coverage. The Individual was personally liable for past premiums and penalties owed to Workforce Safety and Insurance. Muldoon v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins. Fund, 2012 ND 244, 823 N.W.2d 761, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 2012).

   District court did not err in holding that the company had not lost its employer immunity under the workers' compensation laws where the ultimate determination that the driver was an independent contractor had not been overruled in subsequent decisions, and reasonable persons could have only concluded that the company had not willfully misrepresented the amount of its payroll for purposes of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-33" target="_self">65-04-33</a></cite>(2).

     <p>
      All original claims for benefits must be filed by the injured employee, or someone on the injured employee’s behalf, within one year after the injury or within two years after the death. The date of injury for purposes of this section is the first date that a reasonable person knew or should have known that the employee suffered a work-related injury and has either lost wages because of a resulting disability or received medical treatment. Notwithstanding a statute of limitations assertion, the claimant bears the burden of proving any entitlement to benefits. If the organization is estopped from applying the statute of limitations in this section because an employer’s willful conduct prevented an injured employee from filing a claim in a timely manner, that employer shall reimburse the organization for the full amount of all benefits paid during the first five years of that claim. Benefits may not be allowed under this title to any person, except as provided in section 65-05-04, unless that person, or someone on that person’s behalf, files a written claim for benefits within the time specified in this section. A claim must be filed by:

   The evidence was insufficient to show a claimant knew or had reason to know he suffered a compensable work-related injury in 2013 where although he experienced symptoms while working then and sought medical treatment for those symptoms, he had not filed a workers’ compensation claim, the causes and effects of his carpal tunnel symptoms were not apparent to a reasonable layperson, and his symptoms were not linked to a specific triggering event. The limitations period for the workers’ compensation claim did not begin until he was informed by his physician in 2019 that he had a compensable injury, and thus, the ALJ’s contrary finding was not supported by the weight of the evidence. The district court properly reversed the administrative order sustaining the denial of the workers’ compensation claim. Bahmiller v. N.D.

   Workers’ compensation claimant’s time to file began when he was first informed that he had a herniated disc which was linked to a fall suffered at work, rather than from the date he actually fell, where the claimant was initially informed by a physician that his back pain was the result of arthritis.

   Where defendant had received medical treatment for his lung condition, had missed numerous work days because of that condition, and had been informed by his doctor that the condition was work-related, he reasonably knew that he had a compensable injury which began the period for filing a claim.

   Evidence of free employee access to insurance forms, but limited access to injury report forms necessary for filing workers’ compensation claims, was indicative of employer discouragement of workers’ compensation claims and of the employer’s contribution to a general pattern of employee confusion about when to file workers’ compensation claims and when to file insurance claims.

   An employer’s provision of private insurance payments covering eighty percent of its injured employee’s chiropractic expenses, coupled with evidence of employer misrepresentation and a general pattern of employee confusion facilitated by the employer, warranted tolling the statute of limitations until the last insurance payment.

   Where an employer was alleged to have facilitated a general pattern of employee confusion about when to file a workers’ compensation claim and when to file an insurance claim, the employer had the burden of showing that it made reasonable efforts to inform employees about when an insurance claim was appropriate, when a workers’ compensation claim was appropriate, and of the necessity of timely filing of workers’ compensation claims. Where the employer failed to meet that burden, the one-year period within which to file a workers’ compensation claim under this section is equitably tolled until the injured worker receives the last private insurance carrier payment. Linnertz v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 502 N.W.2d 528, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1993).

   Workers’

   compensation benefits for allege workplace injuries in 1999 or 2000 were properly denied as time-barred, notwithstanding that the employer had allegedly misled the worker to believe that the injuries were not covered, because the worker did not file a timely claim after discovering in 2002 that the claims were covered, at which time the tolling of the statute of limitations for those claims ended.

   There is no good reason to refuse to apply the doctrine of estoppel against the workers’ compensation fund created by the payment of premiums by employers, which payments earn the employers immunity from claims for relief by injured employees.

   Claimant failed to timely file a claim for workers’ compensation benefits because the claimant had at all times indicated that his psychological problems began when he was trapped at work on December 5, 2013; he sought medical treatment shortly after the incident and he was encouraged to apply for worker’s compensation benefits by a medical professional; and, if he received a physical injury from repeatedly hitting his head against the wall during the work incident, the evidence supported a finding that a reasonable lay person, not learned in medicine, knew or should have known that he suffered a compensable work-related injury on December 5, 2013; however, the claimant did not file a claim for workers’ compensation benefits until May 2016.

   Because the employer’s failure to file a first report of notice of injury does not result in a loss of that employer’s right to assert the exclusive remedy of worker’s compensation, the claimant’s former employer was not responsible for his damages for failing to file a first report under this statute. Frith v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2014 ND 93, 845 N.W.2d 892, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 1027, 135 S. Ct. 719, 190 L.

   Bureau has full power and authority to hear and determine all questions within its jurisdiction, and its decision is final. Gotchy v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 49 N.D. 915, 194 N.W. 663, 1923 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1923).

   Workers’ compensation bureau is charged with duty and vested with authority to hear and determine all claims by an injured employee for compensation from fund, and in exercise of such power it has full authority to hear and determine all questions within its jurisdiction.

   A claimant’s right to an evidentiary hearing by the workers’ compensation bureau is not limited to only those instances where the claimant can make a further showing in addition to his original claim. A claimant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing whenever a dispute of material fact exists, including instances where the factual dispute arises from the original claim. Weber v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 377 N.W.2d 571, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 436</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>

   Action of compensation bureau declining to reopen claim constitutes “final action”, and is appealable where determination evidences final decision refusing compensation. Hanson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 60 N.D. 220, 233 N.W. 900, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 223</cite> (N.D. 1930).

       <p>

   Decision of workers’ compensation bureau on matters of fact is final, except on ground going to basis of claimant’s right, but bureau may not take arbitrary action. Wallace v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 69 N.D. 165, 284 N.W. 420, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1939).
       </p>
       <p>

   When workers’ compensation bureau determined an applicant was entitled to share in compensation fund, any decision which it made as to amount of compensation, if any, to be allowed for any of different factors in injury, was declared to be final. Schmidt v. North Dakota Workmen’s Comp. Bureau, 74 N.D. 520, 23 N.W.2d 26 (1946), decided prior to the amendment to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-04" target="_self">65-05-04</a></cite>.
       </p>
       <p>

   The decision of the bureau is final and entitled to the same faith and credit as a judgment of the court of record, except that a claimant may appeal therefrom to the district court. Knutson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 120 N.W.2d 880, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>

   Question of whether an injury occurred “in course of employment” is within jurisdiction of workers’ compensation bureau, and its decision is res judicata unless timely appealed from, or unless it is shown in a subsequent proceeding that extenuating circumstances deprived claimant of opportunity to make an informed decision whether to file for benefits. Stine v. Weiner, 238 N.W.2d 918, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>

   Trial court did not err by granting summary judgment to Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) in its collection action against the claimant because he did not administratively challenge the WSI notice of decision denying liability for his and requiring reimbursement for overpayment rendering it final. State v. Oden, 2020 ND 243, 951 N.W.2d 187, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 242</cite> (N.D. 2020).

   This section means only that when decisions of the bureau are final, and not merely interlocutory, they are entitled to full faith and credit. The statute does not render unappealable a final, noninterlocutory bureau decision. It does not speak to appealability; it addresses only the effect of finality, which is full faith and credit. Thus, an unappealed workers’ compensation decision is a final decision entitled to full faith and credit. Westman v.

   Although the claimant has the burden of establishing his right to receive benefits, the bureau should not place itself in a true or full adversary position to the claimant. Weber v.

   Where additional evidence has become available after a case has been appealed to the district court, the court should remand to the bureau to take the additional evidence and reconsider its decision since the court has no power to take the evidence itself. Knutson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 120 N.W.2d 880, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 1963) (decided before 1965 amendment of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-10s65-10-01" target="_self">65-10-01</a></cite>).

       </h5>
       <p>

   An unappealed workers compensation bureau decision is res judicata unless the Bureau reopens a claim. Lass v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 415 N.W.2d 796, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   The res judicata effect of a workers compensation bureau decision extends only to matters adjudicable at the time of that decision; thus, absent a reopening, an unappealed decision on an employee’s present medical condition is final and res judicata of his medical condition at that time; such a decision, however, is not res judicata of his future medical condition, which was not adjudicable at the time of that decision. Lass v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 415 N.W.2d 796, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   Claimant could not retry the issue of whether his initial non-work injury was a preexisting condition sufficient to invoke the aggravation statute. Rieniets v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 512 N.W.2d 708, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>

   In the absence of new evidence or a change in medical condition, the bureau’s order awarding a claimant benefits for her work injury, entered with knowledge of a noncompensable injury and after a formal adjudicative hearing, precludes the bureau from relitigating the effect of the noncompensable injury on her work injury. Cridland v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1997 ND 223, 571 N.W.2d 351, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 281</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a collection action seeking to recover unpaid worker’s compensation insurance premiums, whether or not a company hired independent contractors was an issue that could not have been raised due to administrative res judicata. It was the precise issue decided in a prior administrative action determining liability.

   Workers’ compensation bureau, upon determining that claimant is entitled to participate in compensation fund, has continuing jurisdiction over application and injury stated therein, whether injury is held temporary or permanent.

   Absent an appeal from an order denying benefits, a workers compensation bureau decision not to reopen a claim for consideration of new or additional evidence of medical condition at the time of a denial which is sought to be reopened is not appealable, but a bureau decision not to reopen a claim upon a request based upon a change in the claimant’s medical condition since the original decision is appealable.

   After bureau’s order on claim has become final, bureau’s decision regarding whether or not to reopen original claim is discretionary and claimant has no right to appeal from that decision. Jones v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 334 N.W.2d 188, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 292</cite> (N.D. 1983).

   Claimant had no right to appeal bureau’s decision not to reopen his claim. Manikowske v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 338 N.W.2d 823, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 354</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>

   Although when a claimant seeks to reopen a claim based upon evidence of a change in medical condition, the bureau must exercise its jurisdiction and consider the request on its merits, and the bureau’s decision thereon is appealable, the bureau’s decision whether to reopen an original claim and relitigate the claimant’s earlier medical condition is discretionary, and the claimant has no right to appeal that decision.

   Where an application is made within time required by statute, fact that bureau may have allowed compensation based upon mere partial knowledge of extent of injury does not prevent applicant from having application reopened long after time for filing original claims has passed. Schmidt v. North Dakota Workmen’s Comp.

   After judgment on an appeal, bureau may not deny or refuse right of claimant established upon an appeal, but it may increase or decrease award, or may award lump sum comformably to judgment rendered. Gotchy v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 49 N.D. 915, 194 N.W. 663, 1923 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>

   Judgment awarding compensation to an injured workman when acted upon by bureau becomes award of bureau and subject to its continuing jurisdiction the same as any other award. Dahl v. Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 63 N.D. 327, 248 N.W. 273, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1933).
       </p>
       <p>

   Continuing jurisdiction is jurisdiction to modify awards with respect to payments falling due in future in accordance with facts later found to exist, and, where an award has been made by court and incorporated in judgment, continuing jurisdiction of bureau must be exercised pursuant to and consistent with judgment rendered. Hanson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 63 N.D. 479, 248 N.W. 680, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1933).

       <p>

   The bureau at any time, on its own motion or on application, may review award and in accordance with facts found on such review, may end, diminish, or increase compensation previously awarded, or, if compensation has been refused or discontinued, may award compensation; and this authority to review is not limited to consideration of change in claimant’s condition. Geo. E. Haggart, Inc. v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 171 N.W.2d 104, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workforce Safety and Insurance’s exercise of continuing jurisdiction was beyond the scope of the supreme court’s remand in the first appeal; WSI was bound by the supreme court’s judgment in the first appeal and, under the law of the case doctrine, was precluded from using its continuing jurisdiction to readjudicate whether the worker was the employer’s employee.

       <p>

   An unappealed workers compensation bureau decision is res judicata unless the bureau reopens a claim. Lass v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 415 N.W.2d 796, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   The res judicata effect of a workers compensation bureau decision extends only to matters adjudicable at the time of that decision; thus, absent a reopening, an unappealed decision on an employee’s present medical condition is final and res judicata of his medical condition at that time; such a decision, however, is not res judicata of his future medical condition, which was not adjudicable at the time of that decision. Lass v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 415 N.W.2d 796, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   The language of this section which authorizes the Bureau to review an award “at any time” does not preclude application of the doctrine of administrative res judicata to bureau decisions entered after a formal adjudicative hearing. Cridland v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1997 ND 223, 571 N.W.2d 351, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 281</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Appellate court concluded administrative res judicata prevented the Bureau from relying on claimant’s termination from employment to deny wage loss benefits where this issue was not litigated at the hearing. Baier v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 78, 609 N.W.2d 722, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workers Compensation Bureau correctly interpreted N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-08" target="_self">65-05-08</a></cite>(1) in determining the decedent failed to show an actual wage loss caused by a significant change in his compensable medical condition; when the decedent withdrew his appeal of a Bureau order denying further disability benefits, that order became res judicata of the decedent’s medical condition at that time, subject only to reopening under this section. Bachmeier v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2003 ND 63, 660 N.W.2d 217, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>

   When appellant suffered a workplace injury to his nose, he began having headaches and was treated for a sexual dysfunction. Administrative res judicata under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-04" target="_self">65-05-04</a></cite> did not bar the Workforce Safety and Insurance Fund’s denial of benefits for appellant’s headaches and vision problems, because an award of duplicate benefits for Viagra was the dispositive issue before the administrative law judge in the prior case; rather than the compensability of appellant’s headaches and vision problems.

   When the workers’ compensation bureau dismissed, its appeal from an award of disability benefits and stipulated that the only remaining issue was whether the court had erred in stopping benefits after a claimant had accepted Montana benefits, the bureau waived all other issues, including the issue of whether the claimant had factually established a right to receive disability benefits.

   District court did not err in dismissing an employee’s negligence action because an employee and coworker were immune from suit under the Workforce Safety and Insurance Act’s exclusive remedy provisions; the determinations in California administrative proceedings were irrelevant for deciding statutory immunity because the employer paid Workforce Safety and Insurance premiums to secure coverage on the employee’s behalf, and the employee received benefits throughout the California proceedings. Brock v. Price, 2019 ND 240, 934 N.W.2d 5, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   While an employee may choose to file for benefits in the state which provides the benefits the employee finds most desirable, he may not pick and choose which benefits he will file for in each state. Each state has adopted a compensation plan as a whole. To allow an employee to file for the highest benefits of one type in one state and the highest benefit of another type in another state would allow the employee to receive greater compensation than either state contemplated. Plante v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 455 N.W.2d 195, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        As amended, the statute strengthened North Dakota's policy by discouraging claimants from seeking duplicate or supplemental benefits in a second State after obtaining North Dakota benefits; even if that indirect effect conflicted with the policies of other States like Colorado, it was consistent with North Dakota's valid policy and thus survived rational basis review. DeCrow v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins. Fund, 864 F.3d 989, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 13877 (8th Cir. N.D. 2017).

   An injury is received “in the course of employment” under the workers compensation act when it occurs while workman is performing duties of his employment. O'Leary v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 62 N.D. 457, 243 N.W. 805, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>

   Protection afforded to an employee by workers’ compensation act covers such duties as an employee would reasonably and ordinarily be called upon to perform in employment listed and returned to compensation bureau by employer in his application for classification. O'Leary v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 62 N.D. 457, 243 N.W. 805, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>

   Generally, an injury received by an employee in going to and from work is not an injury received “in the course of his employment” within workers’ compensation act. Fink v. Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 68 N.D. 531, 282 N.W. 505, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>

   An injury is received “in due course of employment”, within meaning of the workers’ compensation act, when it comes while workman is doing duty which he is employed to perform. Moug v. Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 70 N.D. 656, 297 N.W. 129, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 212</cite> (N.D. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workers’ compensation fund is created to protect workmen, but is limited to injuries by accident occurring in course of employment, and is not health or accident insurance fund. Booke v. Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 70 N.D. 714, 297 N.W. 779, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite> (N.D. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>

   Compensable injury is not limited to one arising out of employment so long as it is sustained in course of employment. State ex rel. Kusie v. Weber, 72 N.D. 705, 10 N.W.2d 741, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>

   If an employee is injured while performing duty required by his employment, fact that he is at same time going home from his work will not preclude him from recovering compensation. Johnson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 75 N.D. 604, 31 N.W.2d 447, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>

   If injury occurs within period of employment at place where employee may reasonably be and while he is engaged in performing duties of his contract of employment or is engaged in something incident thereto and contemplated thereby, injury arises in course of his employment and is compensable. Welch v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 75 N.D. 608, 31 N.W.2d 498, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>

   An injury arising in course of employment, which is not caused by employee’s willful intention to injure himself or to injure another or by voluntary intoxication of employee, is compensable injury. Lippmann v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 79 N.D. 248, 55 N.W.2d 453, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workers compensation bureau’s decision that injury had not occurred in the course of employment was not supported by a preponderance of the evidence where there were discrepancies in a medical report relied upon by the bureau, which discrepancies were not clarified, and the bureau relied only upon the part of the report favorable to its decision and rejected or disregarded the part of the report and evidence unfavorable to its decision; under such circumstances, the bureau had a duty to clarify the discrepancies as part of its preliminary investigation. In re Claim of Bromley, 304 N.W.2d 412, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1981).

   Compensation fund is not liable for injuries sustained in course of an employment situs of which is outside state. Altman v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 50 N.D. 215, 195 N.W. 287, 1923 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1923).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where there is no express contract providing for extraterritorial coverage, an appointive peace officer of county receiving injuries outside state in course of his employment is not entitled to compensation on account of his injuries. MacArthur v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 62 N.D. 572, 244 N.W. 259, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>

   This statute was intended to prevent duplication of benefits, and was held not to apply where claimant, who was not informed of his rights, had drawn partial benefits in Montana, and wanted to apply for the remainder of his benefits under the North Dakota law. Bekkedahl v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 222 N.W.2d 841, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite> (N.D. 1974), limited, United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v.

   Claimant who made an informed choice in applying for and receiving benefits under another state’s compensation program for death of her husband that occurred in that state irrevocably waived any rights to obtain benefits under North Dakota compensation program by such application and receipt.

   Bureau’s findings of fact were not supported by preponderance of evidence where, although one doctor concluded that based upon claimant’s history, work injury to feet did not cause claimant’s back problems, that doctor was not specifically asked whether claimant’s fall caused his back injury or whether back injury manifested itself when claimant returned to work; therefore, where another doctor explicitly opined that claimant’s fall caused his back pain, although the latter doctor’s opinion was necessarily reliant upon claimant’s history long after the fact of claimant’s initial injury, the testimony did not support the bureau’s determination that the fall in question did not cause claimant’s later back pain.

   Because an administrative law judge (ALJ) did not apply the correct standard when evaluating conflicting medical opinions on causation where the ALJ’s rationale for discounting the opinion favorable to the claimant relied upon the importance of supporting a medical opinion with another scientific authority, such as a treatise or a published report of a study and neither the statutes nor case law imposed such a requirement, and because the court was unpersuaded by the ALJ’s speculation as to factual errors in the opinions, the court reversed an order affirming a decision of the Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance Fund denying benefits for treatment of a worker’s back injury. The court also noted that it did not understand the ALJ’s reference to a “particularly heavy burden” and stated that the claimant need only prove it was more likely than not that his injuries were caused by his employment.

To be compensable, the disability must be traceable to an injury suffered in the course of the claimant’s employment, and where a very serious disability existed in claimant prior to the accident upon which his claims were based, claimant was entitled to compensation only for aggravation of the previous disability. Bender v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 139 N.W.2d 150, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1965).

        Where decedent sustained injuries which were compensable under the act and for which his beneficiaries did in fact receive compensation, estate of decedent was barred from bringing tort suit against decedent’s employer for the noncompensable injuries of pain and suffering. Hulne v. International Harvester Co., 496 F. Supp. 849, 1980 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13518 (D.N.D. 1980).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Co-employees retain their status as co-employees and their immunity from tort liability so long as they are acting in the course of their employment; the most satisfactory test to determine course of employment for purposes of co-employee immunity is the same course-of-employment test used to determine basic compensation coverage. Under that standard, in determining co-employee immunity, the test is whether the negligent co-employee would have been entitled to receive workers’ compensation benefits if that co-employee had been injured in the same incident. Mitchell v. Sanborn, 536 N.W.2d 678, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1995).

   Employee who applied for and received workers’ compensation for an injury caused by the shattering of a steel pin manufactured by his employer for use in the employer’s business was barred by this section from bringing an action against the contributing employer for the injury, and by failing to prove that the steel pin was manufactured for sale to the public rather than for the employer’s own use, the employee failed to establish any exception to this section that would entitle him to maintain an action against his employer under the dual capacity doctrine that the employer was also liable as a manufacturer of a defective product.

        Truck driver who had received workers’ compensation for injuries was precluded from raising question of employment status in subsequent tort action against employer and fellow employee and thus had no right of action against either of them for same injuries and his wife had no right of action for loss of consortium. Lovelette v. Braun, 293 F. Supp. 41, 1968 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11855 (D.N.D. 1968).
       </p>
       <p>

   Generally, when an employer complies with the workers’ compensation statutes, the employee’s exclusive remedy against the employer is limited to recovery under the workers’ compensation statutes. Barsness v. General Diesel &amp; Equip. Co., 422 N.W.2d 819, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   Third-party indemnity and contribution action for fraud and deceit against employer was barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the Workers' Compensation Act. Smith v. Vestal, 494 N.W.2d 370, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court did not err in dismissing an employee’s negligence action because an employee and coworker were immune from suit under the Workforce Safety and Insurance Act’s exclusive remedy provisions; the determinations in California administrative proceedings were irrelevant for deciding statutory immunity because the employer paid Workforce Safety and Insurance premiums to secure coverage on the employee’s behalf, and the employee received benefits throughout the California proceedings. Brock v. Price, 2019 ND 240, 934 N.W.2d 5, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>

   Employer was entitled to supervisory writs directing a district court to grant the employer summary judgment barring civil liability for deceased and injured workers’ injuries because Workforce and Safety Insurance’s unappealed decision that the workers were employees was res judicata. Plains Trucking, LLC v. Hagar, 2019 ND 226, 932 N.W.2d 541, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       </h5>
       <p>

   As a matter of law, employee’s act of horseplay, in intentionally pushing the knees out from under co-employee, was not a sufficiently substantial deviation from his course of employment so as to transform him from a co-employee to a third-person tortfeasor. Mitchell v. Sanborn, 536 N.W.2d 678, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>

   Where employer had complied with the workers’ compensation statutes and injured employee had received workmen’s compensation benefits for his injuries, employee was barred from recovery in tort action against employer for his injuries, and employer was properly dismissed, as a third-party defendant in an action for the injuries brought by the employee against a third party who had joined the employer to the action in an attempt to seek contribution or indemnity. Gernand v. Ost Servs., 298 N.W.2d 500, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 300</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section bars any cause of action for contribution or indemnity that a third party may have against the employer, arising out of the third party’s common-law liability to an injured employee. White v. McKenzie Electric Cooperative, Inc., 225 F. Supp. 940, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6497 (D.N.D. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>

   In situations where an employer and a third-party tortfeasor both negligently cause an employee’s injuries, liability is imposed on the third-party tortfeasor for the negligence of the third party and the employer without permitting the third-party tortfeasor to get contribution from the employer. Barsness v. General Diesel &amp; Equip. Co., 422 N.W.2d 819, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   The exclusive remedy rule prohibiting a third-party tortfeasor from getting contribution from the employer does not prohibit enforcement of an employer’s contractual agreement to indemnify a third-party tortfeasor. Barsness v. General Diesel &amp; Equip. Co., 422 N.W.2d 819, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   The issue of whether the Workers’ Compensation Bureau denied worker a fair hearing because it failed to establish a system of peer review as required under subsection (3) of this section was not preserved for appeal where worker did not raise this issue in the administrative proceedings nor in her appeal before the district court; an issue which has not been properly raised before the trial court cannot be raised for the first time on appeal to the supreme court.

   Claimant did not have standing to challenge the workers compensation bureau’s claimed lack of a peer review system. This section does not allow claimants to appeal adverse bureau decisions on matters of “reasonableness of fees and payment denials for unjustified treatments”. Swanson v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 553 N.W.2d 209, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 212</cite> (N.D. 1996).

   In a workers' compensation case, it was not an abuse of discretion for the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance Fund (WSI) to deny a claimant's request for a myoelectric prosthesis during binding dispute resolution because the WSI was not required to provide the claimant's preferred device; it considered each device's durability, cost, and impact on the amputation injuries suffered.

   Worker lacked standing to challenge worker’s compensation bureau denial of payment for medical tests worker had received, since worker did not show that he was personally billed for those services, nor that he was denied medical services as a result of the bureau’s refusal to pay.

An employer may not require an employee to use sick leave or annual leave, or other employer-paid time off work, before applying for benefits under this section, in lieu of receiving benefits under this section, or in conjunction with benefits provided under this section, but may allow an employee to use sick leave or annual leave to make up the difference between the employee’s wage-loss benefits and the employee’s regular pay. If the period of disability is five consecutive calendar days’ duration or longer, benefits must be paid for the period of disability provided that:

       When disability benefits are discontinued, the organization may not begin payment again unless the injured employee files a reapplication for disability benefits on a form supplied by the organization. In case of reapplication, the award may commence no more than thirty days before the date of reapplication. Disability benefits must be reinstated upon proof by the injured employee that:

Payments of disability and rehabilitation benefits of an employee who is eligible for, or receiving, benefits under this title must be discontinued when the employee is confined in a penitentiary, jail, youth correctional facility, or any other penal institution for a period in excess of one hundred eighty consecutive days.

To facilitate recovery of those benefits, the organization may offset future benefits payable, under section 65-05-29. If the employee willfully fails to report wages earned, the employee is subject to the penalties in section 65-05-33. An employee shall report whether the employee has performed work or received wages. The organization periodically shall provide a form to all injured employees receiving disability or rehabilitation benefits which the injured employee must complete to retain eligibility for further disability or rehabilitation benefits, regardless of the date of injury or claim filing. The form will advise the injured employee of the possible penalties for failure to report any work or activities as required by this section. An injured employee who is receiving disability or vocational rehabilitation benefits must report any work activities to the organization whether or not the injured employee receives any wages. An injured employee who is receiving disability or vocational rehabilitation benefits must also report any other activity if the injured employee receives any money, including prize winnings, from undertaking that activity, regardless of expenses or whether there is a net profit.

To receive additional disability or vocational rehabilitation benefits following an unjustified limitation or refusal, the employee shall meet the requirements of a reapplication for benefits as outlined in this section.

   RTW cards sent to worker under subsection (3) did not violate his procedural due process rights given that this section applied to him despite its enactment after his date of injury. Furthermore, the fact that the cards fail to define work or put claimants on notice as to what the Bureau considers work also does not violate claimants’ due process rights given that while the Bureau may not agree with the claimants’ view of work, the Bureau takes the risk that the courts will not agree with its application of the term to particular facts.

       <p>

   In determining whether a worker is justified in refusing a job offer, a court looks to see if a reasonably prudent person would refuse the offer under the same or similar circumstances, and also at the following nonexclusive factors found in Pulver v. Dundee Cement Co., 445 Mich. 68, 515 N.W.2d 728 (Mich. 1994): the timing of the offer, if the employee has moved, the reasons for moving, the diligence of the employee in trying to return to work, whether the employee has actually returned to work with some other employer and, whether the effort, risk, sacrifice or expense is such that a reasonable person would not accept the offer.

   Claimant’s argument that subsection (3) of this section did not apply to him because it was not in effect at the time of his work injury in 1988 was without merit given that N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-04" target="_self">65-05-04</a></cite>, providing that the Bureau may review any award and determine whether a worker remains disabled, has been in effect since 1919 and this section provides the Bureau with an appropriate way to investigate such claims by requiring claimants to complete reporting forms on a periodic basis regarding any work they might be performing. Snyder v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2001 ND 38, 622 N.W.2d 712, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 2001).

   Whether worker sustained a significant change in his medical condition attributable to his work injury, and not the “good faith work trial” standard, applies to cases in which worker has reapplied for benefits. Johnson v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 539 N.W.2d 295, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>

   Subsection (1) did not govern claimant’s request for resumption of disability benefits, precluding award of benefits commencing more than thirty days before his reapplication, where 1989 amendment adding subsections (1) and (5) did not apply to his vested right to receive disability benefits upon again becoming disabled under statute in effect on the date of his injury. Jensen v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1997 ND 107, 563 N.W.2d 112, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workers Compensation Bureau’s notice of its intention to discontinue benefits after discovering worker had previously accepted a lump sum settlement in lieu of future benefits established that Bureau had not accepted the worker’s reapplication for benefits.

       </p>
       <p>

   Where Bureau refuses to pay benefits despite an order to do so, the appropriate remedy for claimant was to seek a writ of mandamus in district court directing the Bureau to pay benefits in accordance with its order instead of reapplying for benefits under this section. Baier v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 78, 609 N.W.2d 722, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court was correct in upholding the Workers Compensation Bureau’s order denying the claimant’s reapplication for temporary total disability benefits; the claimant was unable to prove actual wage loss, which was a prerequisite to reinstating discontinued disability benefits under subsection (1) of this section. Gronfur v. N.D. Workers Comp. Fund, 2003 ND 42, 658 N.W.2d 337, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>

   Former employee’s reapplication for benefits for a 1983 lower back injury was properly denied because the employee was unable to show that there was an actual wage loss as a result of the worsening of the prior injury; the employee was able to work until terminated for misconduct, and the employee was not eligible for further benefits until all of the requirements of subsection (1) of this section were satisfied. Lesmeister v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2003 ND 60, 659 N.W.2d 350, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>

   Court did not err in denying a claimant’s reapplication for worker’s compensation benefits where a doctor’s opinion that he was totally disabled from working in July 2002 did not prove that he was similarly disabled six months earlier when he quit his job in January 2002, or that a change in his medical condition caused him to leave his employment.

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-02" target="_self">65-01-02</a></cite>(37) in the context of “actual wage loss” under

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-08" target="_self">65-05-08</a></cite>(1)(b), the claimant must prove that he has sustained an actual loss of remuneration from employment which would be reportable to the internal revenue service as earned income for federal income tax purposes. To demonstrate an actual loss of wages or remuneration as a result of a change in the claimant’s compensable medical condition, the claimant must necessarily first demonstrate that he was earning wages from employment when the change in his medical condition occurred and must then show that the change caused at least a partial loss of those wages.

   compensation disability benefits because N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-08" target="_self">65-05-08</a></cite>(1) applied to a reapplication only when disability benefits had been discontinued, yet the claimant had never received benefits for his work-related injury. Therefore the claimant’s “reapplication” did not fit within the clear language of N.D.C.C. § 65-05-08(1).

The employee therefore failed to make a record to establish his claim that he sustained a significant change in his compensable medical condition.

Additional findings on these issues were required on remand, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_blank">28-32-46</a></cite>(7).

   When claimant was injured at work and received temporary total disability benefits, he filed a claim for additional benefits three years later; North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance properly denied his claim.

   The onus is on the workers compensation bureau to request medical certification of the duration of a claimant’s disability, and thereafter the claimant must ensure that the requested reports are filed.

   The Bureau did not err in denying claimant disability benefits after October 27, 1997, because a reasoning mind reasonably could have determined from the evidence that claimant failed to establish the statutory requirements for verifying disability after October 27, 1997, where she relied on a chiropractor’s report which verified disability for only 17 days; a medical report which did not include a disability rating; and a chiropractor’s report issued just one week prior to the hearing and found to be untimely and therefore inadmissible.

   Workers compensation bureau’s failure to request doctor certification of the period of claimant’s temporary total disability benefits violated this section, and bureau was directed to award claimant benefits through date at which he was certified as at maximum medical improvement; bureau was not absolved from its responsibility to request updated medical certification under this section by protracted administrative and judicial proceedings.

   Due process requires the bureau to give a claimant prior notice of termination of disability benefits, a summary of the medical evidence supporting termination, and an opportunity to respond.

   Pre-termination notice informing worker his disability benefits were going to be terminated based on information that the worker had been working during the time he had been claiming to be totally disabled was not inadequate. Unser v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bur., 1999 ND 129, 598 N.W.2d 89, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1999).

   An allegation that a worker had made “false statements” concerning his physical disability status did not satisfy the fundamental requirements of notice and procedural due process. Vernon v.

       </p>
       <p>

   The fact that the worker was given a transcript of his interview in which he disclosed to an investigator that he had done some snow removal work while receiving disability benefits did not cure the inadequate statement of evidentiary grounds for discontinuing benefits in the notice of intention to discontinue benefits given by the Workers Compensation Bureau. Stewart v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 174, 599 N.W.2d 280, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 1999).

   When worker’s work-related carpal tunnel syndrome resolved and she was subsequently permanently disabled as a result of a non-work-related back injury, she was no longer eligible for temporary disability benefits.

       </p>
       <p>

   North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance erred in terminating the claimant?s disability benefits because the claimant was denied a fair hearing as he was not adequately advised that WSI contemplated terminating his disability benefits on the ground of lack of verification. Brockel v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp;

   Worker's rehabilitation and disability benefits were properly terminated because a reasoning mind could reasonably conclude the worker could return to work when (1) three medical providers, including one aware of the worker's employment duties, released the worker to return to work, and (2) no medical doctor certified the worker's disability status.

      If, after receiving a claim for benefits, the organization determines that more information is needed to process the claim, but that the information in the file indicates the injured employee is more likely than not entitled to disability benefits, the organization may pay preacceptance disability benefits equal to the weekly disability benefit allowed under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-09" target="_self">65-05-09</a></cite>. The organization may continue to pay preacceptance disability benefits to the employee during the period the claim is pending, unless the injured employee is not cooperating with requests from the organization for additional information needed to process the claim. The organization may not pay more than sixty days of preacceptance benefits.

        Application.

      </p>
      <p>

   In a workers’ compensation case, an opinion from a benefit claimant’s doctor was not entitled to controlling weight because the statute relating to treating doctor’s opinions did not apply to managed care programs.

   Whedbee v. N.D. Workforce Safety, 2014 ND 79, 845 N.W.2d 632, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 2014).

       <b>
        Requirements.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Administrative law judge (ALJ) properly found that an employee had sustained a compensable injury and was entitled to benefits because the ALJ made specific findings regarding the ALJ’s consideration of the evidence presented at the hearing, weighed the doctors’ competing opinions; because the ALJ had the opportunity to observe witnesses and the responsibility to assess the credibility of witnesses and resolve the conflicts in the evidence, the supreme court would not reweigh the evidence. State v. Sandberg, 2021 ND 39, 956 N.W.2d 342, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 2021).

      <p>

   District court erred in overturning the denial of workers’ compensation benefits by North Dakota Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance (WSI) because WSI satisfied the statute by establishing that the claimant’s treating doctors’ opinions were inconsistent with other substantial record evidence and adequately explained its reasons for disregarding medical evidence favorable to her.

       If an injury causes temporary total or permanent total disability, the fund shall pay to the injured employee during that disability a weekly benefit equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the gross average weekly wage of the injured employee, subject to a minimum of sixty percent and a maximum of one hundred twenty-five percent of the average weekly wage in the state. If an injured employee is disabled due to an injury, that injured employee’s benefits will be based upon the injured employee’s wage and the organization benefit rates in effect on the date of first disability.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-09ol12">
       Unless otherwise provided in this subsection, if an injured employee suffers disability but is able to return to employment for a period of three consecutive calendar months or more, that injured employee’s benefits will be based upon the wage received at the time of the recurrence of the disability. If the wage received at the time of the recurrence of the disability is lower than the injured employee’s average weekly wage and the lower wage is due to the physical limitations of the compensable injury, the injured employee’s benefits must be based upon the injured employee’s average weekly wage. It is the burden of the injured employee to show the inability to earn as much as the injured employee’s average weekly wage is due to the physical limitation related to the injury. The organization benefit rates are those in effect at the time of that recurrence.

       When an injured employee is permanently and totally disabled, must be maintained in a nursing home or similar facility, and has no dependent parent, spouse, or children, as much of that injured employee’s weekly benefit as is necessary may be used by the organization to help defray the cost of the nursing home care.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When an injured employee, or spouse or dependent of an injured employee, is eligible for and is receiving permanent total or temporary total disability benefits under section 65-05-09, and is also eligible for, is receiving, or will receive, benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 423], the aggregate benefits payable under section 65-05-09 must be reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal as nearly as practicable to one-half of such federal benefit. The federal benefit, or primary insurance amount, must be determined by the social security administration. The amount to be offset must equal the primary insurance amount rounded to the next lowest dollar less credit for either the entire amount of attorney’s fees and costs, or the fees and costs paid to an authorized representative of the employee as allowed by the social security administration, withheld from past-due social security benefits or paid directly by the claimant for representation before the social security administration. The amount of the offset computed by the organization initially must remain the same throughout the period of eligibility and may not be affected by any increase or decrease in federal benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any injured employee, or dependent of an injured employee, receiving permanent total or temporary total disability benefits under section 65-05-09 and whose benefits are offset as provided herein, is not eligible for any escalation of benefits which would adversely affect the organization’s right to offset workforce safety and insurance benefits against social security benefits, as provided for in this chapter. This offset will become effective on January 1, 1980, provided that it meets the criteria necessary to allow states to offset federal benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 424a].

       Retirement offset.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If an employee is entitled to permanent total disability benefits and social security retirement benefits under 42 U.S.C. sections 402 and 405, the aggregate wage-loss benefits payable under this title must be determined in accordance with this section. The employee’s social security retirement offset must equal forty percent of the calculated ratio of the employee’s average weekly wages, as calculated on the commencement of the first, or recurrent, disability under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-09" target="_self">65-05-09</a></cite>, to the current state’s average weekly wage. Any offset calculated cannot exceed forty percent of the employee’s weekly social security retirement benefit. If a claim has been accepted on an aggravation basis and the employee is eligible for social security benefits, the organization’s offset must be proportionally calculated. An overpayment must be recouped in the same manner as set forth in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-09" target="_self">65-05-09</a></cite>.1. This section applies to an employee who becomes entitled to and receives social security retirement benefits after June 30, 1989, or who receives social security retirement benefits that have been converted from social security disability benefits by the social security administration after June 30, 1989. A conversion by the organization from offsetting an employee’s social security disability benefits to offsetting an employee’s social security retirement benefits under this section may not result in a decrease in the aggregate amount of benefits the employee receives from both sources.

   Because a benefit claimant’s total disability was determined prior to the 1989 and 1993 effective dates of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-09.2" target="_self">65-05-09.2</a></cite>, the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) was unable to offset the claimant’s retirement benefits against his workers compensation disability benefits due to the claimant’s reliance interest in benefits and the obligation to pay by WSI. However, attorney fees and costs were not awarded since WSI did not act without substantial justification under the standard utilized in the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C.S. § 2412 because at least one judge agreed with the position advanced by WSI and it was a close question regarding unsettled law.

   There is no statutory presumption of retirement for any employee who is permanently and totally disabled as defined in this title. Kallhoff v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 484 N.W.2d 510, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   An employee who planned to retire and submitted his letter of intent to retire, but then became permanently and totally disabled before his intended retirement date, was entitled to collect workers’ compensation benefits after the date of his retirement. Shiek v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2001 ND 166, 634 N.W.2d 493, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 2001).

   As a matter of law, an employee who becomes permanently and totally disabled on or before the employee’s intended retirement date has not retired or voluntarily withdrawn from the labor force.

   This section does not terminate the disability benefits of workers who were already receiving permanent total disability benefits before 1995 amendment to this section took effect. Gregory v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 94, 578 N.W.2d 101, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1998).

   This section does not apply to terminate the disability benefits of a claimant or other worker already receiving total disability benefits before the 1995 statute took effect, even as amended by 1997 amendment.

   Bureau erred in ruling claimant’s permanent and total disability was irrelevant to application of retirement presumption under this section; clear language of section excludes permanently and totally disabled employees from operation of the presumption. Shiek v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 139, 582 N.W.2d 639, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>

   Claimant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant is totally and permanently disabled for retirement presumption not to apply. Shiek v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 139, 582 N.W.2d 639, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workforce Safety and Insurance did not err in holding that the retirement presumption provisions of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-09.3" target="_self">65-05-09.3</a></cite>(2) applied to an employee’s workers’ compensation claim because when the employee’s total disability benefits were terminated for a period beginning in August 1995, the employee lost the reliance interest in continued benefits and the provisions of the retirement presumption statute became applicable to the claim.

   Eslinger v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2009 ND 90, 765 N.W.2d 731, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 2009).

   For purposes of eligibility for disability benefits, this section creates a presumption that an employee has “retired” when the employee has “voluntarily withdrawn from the labor force.” So, retirement is linked with the ordinary and commonly understood meaning that retirement is voluntary.

      At least 1 year and less than 3 years of disability 5 percent of weekly benefit. At least 3 years and less than 5 years of disability 10 percent of weekly benefit.

Partial disability benefits are subject to a maximum of one hundred twenty-five percent of the average weekly wage in the state. The combined partial disability benefits, dependency allowance, and postinjury wage-earning capacity may not exceed ninety percent of the average weekly wage of the injured employee.

   One of the rehabilitative goals of North Dakota’s workforce safety and insurance law was to return a disabled employee to substantial gainful employee with a minimum of retraining, as soon as possible after an injury has occurred, according to

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>(3). Since the evidence presented in the claimant’s case showed that the claimant could go to work as a store greeter despite wrist and shoulder pain the claimant had experienced in the claimant’s prior job, the evidence showed that the claimant had a residual earning capacity of $ 290 per week and was consistent with the establishment of earning capacity pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-10" target="_self">65-05-10</a></cite>(3).

   A discharge for just cause does not automatically bar an employee from receiving disability benefits. Wendt v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 467 N.W.2d 720, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>

   There are three factors for determining whether an individual is entitled to partial disability benefits: First, there should be a physical disability; second, the disability should be partial, or in other words, the employee should be able to work subject to the disability; and third, there should be an actual loss of earning capacity that is causally related to the disability.

   Trial court erred in upholding an order terminating an employee’s total disability benefits and awarding the employee partial disability benefits where the employee could not be returned to substantial gainful employment, as defined in

   Evidence supported finding that an injured claimant refused to participate in rehabilitation options that were available to him; as such, the district court properly affirmed the Workforce Safety and Insurance order that terminated the award of rehabilitation benefits and partial disability benefits, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>.

   Trial court properly overturned a decision from the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance to discontinue an employee’s partial disability benefits on the ground that it had paid the employee benefits for longer than the five-year limit provided by a 1991 amendment to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-10" target="_self">65-05-10</a></cite> where there was no evidence that after the employee’s June 1990 work injury, the employee ever regained the employee’s earning capacity. The plain language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-10" target="_self">65-05-10</a></cite> required application of the five-year limit on disability benefits when an injured worker’s partial loss of capacity to earn wages happened after June 30, 1991.

   When the language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-10" target="_self">65-05-10</a></cite>(2) is considered in conjunction with the sparse legislative history for the specific provisions of that subsection and the general purpose of the legislation as a “cost saving bill,” the North Dakota Supreme Court concludes that the intention of the legislation is to limit partial disability benefits to a cumulative time period of five years; the North Dakota Supreme Court declines to amend or add language to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-10" target="_self">65-05-10</a></cite>(2) to authorize payment of partial disability benefits for five continuous years before those benefits may be terminated. Therefore, benefits were properly terminated in a case where a claimant had been paid for 5 cumulative years, but not for five continuous years.

   Where employer reduced employee’s benefits to partial disability benefits upon her return to work and later discontinued those benefits after five years, employer properly applied N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-10" target="_self">65-05-10</a></cite>(2) to deny waiver of five-year limitation although employee met the statutory requirements in that she had long-term restrictions and worked less than 28 hours per week; the plain language of the statute gave the employer the discretion as to whether to waive the five-year limitation when an employee meets one of the exceptions of the statute.

      This benefit only applies to claims with a date of first disability or date of successful reapplication occurring after June 30, 1991. For these claims, beginning on the first day of July immediately following the fifth full year of partial disability and every year thereafter, an injured employee who has received a waiver of the five-year cap on partial disability benefits under section 65-05-10 is eligible for a lump sum inflation adjustment. The organization shall calculate the lump sum inflation adjustment under this section on July first of each year by multiplying the previous year’s percent increase in the state’s average weekly wage, if any, by the total amount of partial disability payments paid to the injured employee in the preceding twelve months, including the preceding year’s inflationary adjustment award.

     <p>
      A permanent impairment is not intended to be a periodic payment and is not intended to reimburse the employee for specific expenses related to the injury or wage loss. If a compensable injury causes permanent impairment, the organization shall determine a permanent impairment award on the following terms:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-12.2ol11">
       The organization shall calculate the amount of the award by multiplying thirty-five percent of the average weekly wage in this state on the date of the impairment evaluation, rounded to the next highest dollar, by the permanent impairment multiplier specified in subsection 10.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-12.2ol12">
       The organization shall notify the employee by certified mail, to the last-known address of the employee, when that employee becomes potentially eligible for a permanent impairment award. After the organization has notified the employee, the employee shall file, within one hundred eighty days from the date the employee was notified, a written request for an evaluation for permanent impairment. Failure to file the written request within the one hundred eighty-day period precludes an award under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-12.2ol13">
       An injured employee is entitled to compensation for permanent impairment under this section only for those findings of impairment that are permanent and which were caused by the compensable injury. The organization may not issue an impairment award for impairment findings due to unrelated, noncompensable, or pre-existing conditions, even if these conditions were made symptomatic by the compensable work injury, and regardless of whether section 65-05-15 applies to the claim.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-12.2ol14">
       An injured employee is eligible for an evaluation of permanent impairment only when all conditions caused by the compensable injury have reached maximum medical improvement. The injured employee’s doctor shall report to the organization the date an employee has reached maximum medical improvement and any evidence of impairment of function the injured employee has after that date. If the report states that the employee is potentially eligible for a permanent impairment award, the organization shall conduct a review and provide notice to the employee as provided by subsection 2. If the injured employee files a timely written request under subsection 2, the organization shall schedule an impairment evaluation by a doctor qualified to evaluate the impairment.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-12.2ol15">
       A health care provider evaluating permanent impairment shall include a clinical report in sufficient detail to support the percentage ratings assigned. The organization shall adopt administrative rules governing the evaluation of permanent impairment. These rules must incorporate principles and practices of the sixth edition of the American medical association’s “Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment” modified to be consistent with North Dakota law, to resolve issues of practice and interpretation, and to address areas not sufficiently covered by the guides. Subject to rules adopted under this subsection, impairments must be evaluated under the sixth edition of the guides.

       Other than an award identified in subsection 11, an award may not be issued unless specifically identified and quantified within the sixth edition of the American medical association’s “Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment”.

       If an employee dies, the right to any compensation payable pursuant to an impairment evaluation previously requested by the employee under subsection 2, which remains unpaid on the date of the employee’s death, survives and passes to the employee’s dependent spouse, minor children, parents, or estate, in that order. If the employee dies, only those findings of impairment which are objectively verifiable such as values for surgical procedures and amputations may be considered in a rating for impairment. Impairment findings not supported by objectively verifiable evidence may not be included in a rating for impairment. The deceased employee’s dependents or representatives shall request an impairment award under this subsection within one year from the date of death of the employee.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-12.2ol110">
       If the injury causes permanent impairment, the award must be determined based on the percentage of whole body impairment in accordance with the following schedule:
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-12.2ol111">
       An amputation of a finger or toe at the level of the distal interphalangeal joint or proximal to that joint, or the thumb or the great toe at the interphalangeal joint or proximal to that joint, which is determined to result in a whole body impairment of less than fourteen percent and which is not identified in the following schedule, is payable as a fourteen percent impairment. If an evaluation for the loss of an eye or for an amputation results in an award that is less than the permanent impairment multiplier identified in the following schedule, the organization shall pay an award equal to the permanent impairment multiplier set out in the following schedule:
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-12.2ol112">
       If there is a medical dispute regarding the percentage of an injured employee’s permanent impairment, all relevant medical evidence must be submitted to an independent health care provider who has not treated the employee and who has not been consulted by the organization in relation to the injury upon which the impairment is based. The organization shall establish a list of health care providers who have the training and experience necessary to conduct an evaluation of permanent impairment and to apply the sixth edition of the American medical association’s “Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment”. The organization shall define, by rule, the process by which the organization shall choose an independent health care provider or health care providers to review a disputed permanent impairment evaluation or rating. The decision of the independent health care provider or health care providers chosen under this process is presumptive evidence of the degree of permanent impairment of the employee which can only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. This subsection does not impose liability on the organization for an impairment award for a rating of impairment for a body part or condition the organization has not determined to be compensable as a result of the injury. The employee bears the expense of witness fees of the independent health care provider or health care providers if the employee disputes the findings of the independent health care provider or health care providers.

       An attorney’s fees are not payable unless there is a bona fide dispute as to the percentage of the employee’s permanent impairment or unless there is a dispute as to the employee’s eligibility for an award for permanent partial impairment.

   A worker’s right to receive partial permanent impairment benefits is not contractual in nature, and thus the application of this section to a worker injured before its effective date did not violate the constitutional prohibition against impairment of contract rights.

   The AMA Guides do not preclude the Workers Compensation Bureau from combining the ratings and awards for two separate claims pertaining to two separate anatomical impairments. Feist v.

   This section as amended in 2001 requires that the total permanent impairment award given to workers with both prior and subsequent impairments must correspond to the combined value of all the prior and subsequent impairments on a whole-body impairment basis. Shiek v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2002 ND 85, 643 N.W.2d 721, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court erred in affirming an administrative law judge’s order concluding that an injured employee was entitled to both the scheduled impairment award for vision loss and the whole body impairment award for his additional injuries because Workforce Safety and Insurance correctly determined that he was entitled to the greater of the combined rating for all accepted impairments under the AMA Guides or the injury schedule and the subject statute provided the greater permanent impairment multiplier.

   Where there was undisputed medical opinion of permanent partial impairment, and the workers compensation bureau failed to adequately explain its reasons for disregarding that evidence, the bureau erred in not finding that the claimant was entitled to benefits for permanent partial impairment. Hayes v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 425 N.W.2d 356, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where the only medical evidence in the record showed that the claimant had a permanent partial impairment, both physicians discerned pain and its effect, and they identified objective evidence indicative of impairment, the workers compensation bureau erred in denying compensation solely because the claimant’s impairment was not substantiated by objective medical evidence under the American medical association’s guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment. Accordingly, the action was remanded for further proceedings by the bureau to determine the extent of impairment. Kroeplin v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 415 N.W.2d 807, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 440</cite> (N.D. 1987).

   While injured employee’s doctor is required to report when employee reaches maximum medical improvement under subsection (5) of this section, such a report is not binding on the Workers Compensation Bureau.

       </p>
       <p>

   District court properly held an administrative law judge erred in finding an employee had a 50% permanent partial impairment rating because the evidence was insufficient to establish a medical report relied on was based on the sixth edition of the American Medical Association’s Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides), as the report, while using similar language, did not state the report’s evaluation was conducted under the AMA Guides, and no finding or evidence showed which edition of the AMA Guides the report’s author might “likely” have used.

       In cases of a prior injury, disease, or other condition, known in advance of the work injury, which has caused previous work restriction or interference with physical function the progression of which is substantially accelerated by, or the severity of which is substantially worsened by, a compensable injury, the organization shall pay benefits during the period of acute care in full. The period of acute care is presumed to be sixty days immediately following the compensable injury, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Following the period of acute care, the organization shall pay benefits on an aggravation basis.

       The organization shall pay benefits on an aggravation basis as a percentage of the benefits to which the injured worker would otherwise be entitled, equal to the percentage of cause of the resulting condition that is attributable to the compensable injury. Benefits payable on an aggravation basis are presumed to be payable on a fifty percent basis. The party asserting a percentage other than the presumed fifty percent may rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.

   Interpreting the 1997 version of this section, North Dakota Bureau of Workers Compensation properly applied the aggravation statute where a reasoning mind reasonably could have found from the evidence that claimant had preexisting fibromyalgia which caused substantial interference with her functioning, and that the work injury substantially aggravated claimant’s underlying preexisting fibromyalgia.

        Where a claimant did not introduce any evidence that his back condition constituted an aggravation of a compensable injury by a nonemployment injury as distinguished, from a new injury to the same area of his back, compensation was not granted for a non-work-related injury.

   Question of the degree to which an industrial accident aggravated a preexisting coronary disease and combined with it to bring about the death of claimant’s decedent was one of fact to be determined after the taking of evidence by the workmen’s compensation board, and the excuse that medical testimony was difficult to obtain for apportionment purposes was not sufficient to justify the board’s practice of awarding 50% of full benefits in all heart attack cases; therefore, where it was settled that claimant was entitled to some compensation, and in the absence of an evidentiary hearing to determine the proper percentage apportionment, she was entitled to receive full benefits. Stout v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 253 N.W.2d 429, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 278</cite> (N.D. 1977).

   Where the workers compensation bureau ignored the testimony of three doctors indicating aggravation of the claimant’s chondromalacia by stair climbing, but it was obvious that the claimant suffered considerable impact to her knees from the repetitive climbing of stairs during her work, the findings of fact made by the agency were not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and by ignoring the effect of the distinctive conditions of her job, the bureau did not make a just determination of her claim.

   Under subdivision (3) (see now (2)) of this section, “[t]he aggravation statute may not be invoked if the result is but a natural progression of the compensable injury.” Thus, in some sense, an everyday activity or event can never substantially contribute to the severity, acceleration, or progression of a condition.

       <p>

   The fact that an incident precipitated the need for treatment, or precipitated an injury’s becoming disabling does not necessarily mean that such an event substantially contributed to the severity, acceleration, or progression of the condition or that it was a substantial factor in it.

Providing benefits only for work-related injury and not for aggravation to work-related injury by nonemployment injury is in accord with the purpose of the Workers’ Compensation Act, to provide sure and certain relief for workers injured in their employment.

       If an employee is determined to be permanently and totally disabled, the organization may pay the employee a lump sum equal to the present value of all future payments of compensation. The probability of the employee’s death before the expiration of the period during which the employee is entitled to compensation must be determined by generally accepted mortality studies. The organization may not pay the employee a lump sum unless it has first determined that there is clear and convincing evidence that the lump sum payment is in the best interest of the employee. Best interest of the employee may not be deemed to exist because the employee can invest the lump sum in another manner to realize a better yield. The employee must show a specific plan of rehabilitation which will enable the employee to return as a productive member of society.

   Injured worker who agreed after consulting with counsel to forego any further disability benefits in exchange for a lump sum settlement from Workers Compensation Bureau was bound by the terms of the agreement and could not subsequently reapply for disability benefits based on a subsequent significant change in his medical condition. Kerzman v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 44, 590 N.W.2d 888, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 48</cite> (N.D. 1999).

   Bureau exceeded its statutory authority by denying a claimant attorney fees for representation before the bureau on his request for a lump sum settlement on the ground that his claim had not been “denied or reduced” under an administrative regulation adopted by the bureau. Moore v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 374 N.W.2d 71, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 388</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   Inclusion of the phrase “or a lump sum stipulated to by the claimant after an opportunity to seek legal counsel” was not prompted by any concern to differentiate between instances in which attorney fees shall be paid for claimants seeking a lump sum settlement. Rather, the only intent that can be discerned for the amendment was to preserve the bureau’s general fund by allowing the bureau to pay a claimant less than it would otherwise have been required under the statute. Moore v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 374 N.W.2d 71, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 388</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   The authority for the bureau to make a lump sum payment is given in this section. A lump sum “may” be paid if the bureau “determines [that] it is in the best interest of the claimant.” Schiff v.

   The bureau is not compelled to make a lump sum payment whenever a disabled claimant believes that it is in his “economic best interest.” Schiff v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 480 N.W.2d 732, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   The ordinary meaning of the phrase “present value of future payments,” with this section is the amount which, if presently received, could be invested in order to yield the sum of future benefits. Thus, present value has nothing to do with past due benefits. Effertz v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 481 N.W.2d 218, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   This section merely authorized the bureau to pay a lump sum settlement if it is in the best interest of the claimant, the sum to be calculated by using standard mortality tables for all future payments of benefits. But, the court cannot discern any language within this section that authorizes the bureau to pay interest on delayed benefits. Effertz v.

     <p>
      An injured employee may select a health care provider of that injured employee’s choice to render initial treatment. Upon a determination that the injured employee’s injury is compensable, the organization may require the injured employee to begin treating with another health care provider to better direct the medical aspects of the injured employee’s claim. The organization shall provide a list of three health care providers who specialize in the treatment of the type of injury the employee sustained. At the organization’s request, the injured employee shall select a health care provider from the list. An injured employee shall follow the directives of the health care provider treating the injured employee as chosen by the injured employee at the request of the organization and comply with all reasonable requests during the time the injured employee is under medical care.

       An injured employee may not change from one health care provider to another while under treatment or after being released, without the prior written authorization of the organization. Failure to obtain approval of the organization renders the injured employee liable for the cost of treatment and the new health care provider will not be considered the attending health care provider for purposes of certifying temporary disability.

       Travel and other personal reimbursement for seeking and obtaining medical care is paid only upon request of the injured employee. All claims for reimbursement must be supported by the original vendor receipt, when appropriate, and must be submitted within one year of the date the expense was incurred or reimbursement must be denied. Reimbursement must be made at the organization reimbursement rates in effect on the date of incurred travel or expense. The calculation for reimbursement for travel by motor vehicle must be calculated using miles actually and necessarily traveled.

An independent medical examination and independent medical review must be for the purpose of review of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, or fees. An independent medical examination contemplates an actual examination of an injured employee, either in person or remotely if appropriate. An independent medical review contemplates a file review of an injured employee’s records, including treatments and testing. The injured employee may have a duly qualified health care provider designated by that employee present at the examination or later review the written report of the allied health care professional performing the independent medical examination, if procured and paid for by that injured employee.

At any time the injured employee is medically noncompliant, efforts by the injured employee to come into compliance are not considered successful compliance until the injured employee has been compliant for a period of at least sixty days. If the period of medical noncompliance continues for sixty days following the date disability and vocational rehabilitation benefits are discontinued, or a second instance of medical noncompliance occurs without good cause, the organization may not pay any further disability and vocational rehabilitation benefits, regardless of whether the injured employee sustained a significant change in medical condition due to the work injury.

An employer’s account may not be charged with the expenses of an aggravation or worsening of a work-related injury or condition unless the employer knowingly required the injured employee to perform activities that exceed the treatment recommendations of the injured employee’s health care provider.

   The legislature intended different meaning for the words “examination” and “treatment” used in this section; the Bureau may suspend benefits for an employee’s refusal to reasonably participate under subsection (4) only if the particular procedure constituted “treatment.” Ali v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 146, 583 N.W.2d 115, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>

   Bureau’s decision to suspend benefits because worker failed to “reasonably participate” in examination was not in accordance with law; this section only provides for suspension of benefits for refusing to submit to or “intentionally obstructing” examination, as failure to “reasonably participate” refers to the worker’s involvement in the treatment. Ali v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 146, 583 N.W.2d 115, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>

   Workforce Safety and Insurance’s decision to discontinue a worker’s benefits was supported by a preponderance of the evidence where the worker failed to provide sufficient evidence of a good cause for her failure to attend an independent medical examination.

   North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) erred in finding that the employee failed to show that his wage loss was the result of his compensable left shoulder injury because the fact that his noncompensable vertebral artery occlusion made it impractical for him to either return to work or undergo surgery necessary to return him to employment did not break the causal connection, the employee had not unreasonably refused to undergo surgery for his left shoulder injury, and WSI's notice of intention to discontinue/reduce benefits seemed to foreclose a functional capacity assessment.

      Notwithstanding section 65-05-28, any employer subject to this title may select a preferred provider to render medical treatment to employees who sustain compensable injuries. “Preferred provider” means a designated provider or group of providers of medical services, including consultations or referral by the provider or providers.

       During the first thirty days after a work injury, an employee of an employer that has selected a preferred provider under this section may seek medical treatment only from the preferred provider for the injury. Treatment by a provider other than the preferred provider is not compensable and the organization may not pay for treatment by a provider who is not a preferred provider, unless a referral was made by the preferred provider. A provider who is not a preferred provider may not certify disability or render an opinion about any matter pertaining to the injury, including causation, compensability, impairment, or disability. This section does not apply to emergency care nor to any care the employee reasonably did not know was related to a work injury.

      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-28.2ol12">
       An employee of an employer that has selected a preferred provider may elect to be treated by a different provider provided the employee makes the election and notifies the employer in writing before the occurrence of an injury.

      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-28.2ol13">
       After thirty days have passed following the injury, the employee may make a written request to the organization to change providers. The employee shall make the request and serve it on the employer and the organization at least thirty days before treatment by the provider. The employee shall state the reasons for the request and the employee’s choice of provider.
      </li>
      <li id="t65c65-05s65-05-28.2ol14">
       If the employer objects to the provider selected by the employee under subsection 2 or 3, the employer may file an objection to the change of provider. The employer shall detail in the objection the grounds for the objection and shall serve the objection on the employee and the organization within five days of service of the request. The employee may serve, within five days of service of the employer’s objection, a written response on the employer and the organization in support of the request for change of provider. Within fifteen days after receipt of the response or of the expiration of the time for filing the response, the organization shall rule on the request. Failure of the organization to rule constitutes approval of the request. Treatment by the employee’s chosen provider is not compensable until the organization approves the request. The preferred provider remains the treating provider until the organization approves the employee’s request to change providers.

   The Supreme Court would not consider whether worker’s criminal judgment for making a false statement and the subsequent imposition of a penalty under this section for his failure to report income while receiving disability benefits constituted double jeopardy based on counsel’s bald assertion first raised on appeal. Unser v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bur., 1999 ND 129, 598 N.W.2d 89, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>

   The administrative remedy for making a false claim or false statement to the Workers Compensation Bureau is a civil sanction, and therefore a subsequent criminal prosecution of the worker does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the federal constitution. State v. Stewart, 1999 ND 154, 598 N.W.2d 773, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 1999).

   Evidence was sufficient to support Workers Compensation Bureau’s finding that worker had willfully failed to report income while receiving disability benefits, and to support both forfeiture of future benefits and compulsory reimbursement of the benefits already received. Unser v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bur., 1999 ND 129, 598 N.W.2d 89, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1999).

         Forfeiture of Future Benefits.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Where employee claimed workers’ compensation benefits and made a false statement about his prior medical history, in that he falsely reported that he had not had prior problems or injuries to the back, the worker’s compensation bureau reasonably determined that claimant’s false statement was sufficiently material to support a forfeiture of future benefits, even though it was not material enough to cause the bureau to pay initial benefits. F.O.E. Aerie 2337 v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 464 N.W.2d 197, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   In worker’s reapplication for benefits, his misstatement of his last day of work with the employer, his false statement that his physician had advised him not to work, coupled with his false statement to a Bureau claims analyst that his new job involved light duty work “pushing buttons” when in fact it involved physical labor, were sufficiently material to warrant forfeiture of future benefits. Renault v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 187, 601 N.W.2d 580, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 207</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>

   Based on the common understanding of work, claimant made a false statement when he reported no work activity while entering as a professional in major fishing tournaments, representing a marine store at boat shows, assisting on the sales floor, accepting entrance fees paid for by the store, and buying a new boat each season at a discounted price. Furthermore, the false statements were material and willful with regard to forfeiture of future benefits as they could have misled the Bureau to consider claimant’s physical capabilities unchanged and not pursue further inquiry into the true nature of his physical activities. Jacobson v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 225, 621 N.W.2d 141, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 277</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>

   Order terminating an employee’s workers compensation benefits was reversed and remanded because the bureau did not prove that the employee willfully made a material false statement justifying forfeiture of future benefits under this section. The employee’s failure to report the receipt of money from the sale of vegetables was not material because the amount of money did not equal 10 percent of his income under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-08" target="_self">65-05-08</a></cite>(8), the bureau did not provide the notice of penalties required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-08" target="_self">65-05-08</a></cite>(3), and the employee’s failure to report his gardening and harvest activities were not willful because casual activities not engaged in for remuneration or for an employer are not reasonably understood to be work. Wanner v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2002 ND 201, 654 N.W.2d 760, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 272</cite> (N.D. 2002).

   Evidence that a worker participated in an aerobics class, played golf, and engaged in weightlifting supported the Workers Compensation Bureau’s determination that the worker’s statements to medical providers about back pain, sitting intolerance, and lack of significant medical change over a four-year period were false. Vernon v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bur., 1999 ND 153, 598 N.W.2d 139, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1999).

   Although there was substantial evidence regarding the nature and extent of the claimant’s work activities and income, in addition to her level of physical activity, from which a reasoning mind could reasonably have found that the claimant purposefully and intentionally made false statements, her misrepresentations had not caused workforce safety and insurance (WSI) to pay medical benefits in error or caused WSI to pay disability benefits in error after her surgery, as WSI had not provided any evidence that any of the medical benefits paid after that date would not have been paid as a result of the claimant’s work-related injuries. Forbes v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins. Fund, 2006 ND 208, 722 N.W.2d 536, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 2006).

   There was substantial evidence regarding the nature and extent of the claimant’s work activities and income, in addition to her level of physical activity, from which a reasoning mind could reasonably have found that the claimant purposefully and intentionally made false statements; the false statements were material with regard to both the forfeiture of all future benefits and to the reimbursement of all disability benefits paid by workforce safety and insurance (WSI) up to the surgery performed on the claimant. Forbes v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins. Fund, 2006 ND 208, 722 N.W.2d 536, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 2006).

   North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) failed to prove that an employee made willful and material false statements in his claim for benefits because it had the employee’s medical records, it did not ask the employee about the chiropractic treatment, and the decision did not adequately explain the interrelationship of those records with WSI’s inconsistent findings about willfulness and with its conclusory statement that the employee’s failure to disclose the treatment was material. Schoch v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2010 ND 25, 778 N.W.2d 542, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 2010).

   Administrative law judge misinterpreted the statute when deciding a worker's false statements that the worker had received no money for work from any source other than Workforce Safety and Insurance were not willful because (1) the definition of “work” given to the worker did not except the worker's efforts assisting a brother in running a business, and (2) “willfully” only required the statements to be intentional in connection with a claim, so proof of intent to defraud was not required.

   To trigger the statutory consequences of this section, a false statement must be intentional, not inadvertent, and material, not peripheral. F.O.E. Aerie 2337 v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 464 N.W.2d 197, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   This section requires a materiality test to be applied to determine whether the false claim or false statement caused benefits to be paid in error, and allows for forfeiture of additional benefits in the future, whether or not the false claim or false statement is de minimis, because false statements should have some consequence. But a false statement must be intentional to trigger thee statutory consequences. F.O.E. Aerie 2337 v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 464 N.W.2d 197, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   A false statement may be sufficiently material to support forfeiture of future benefits, even though it was not sufficiently material to mislead the bureau into paying initial benefits or to require the reimbursement of initial benefits. Dean v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1997 ND 165, 567 N.W.2d 626, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   In addition to proving that a false statement was made, the bureau must prove that the false statement was made intentionally. Hopfauf v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 40, 575 N.W.2d 436, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>

   Claimant willfully and intentionally made material false statements when claiming he had not performed any work where credible evidence was presented that claimant acted as an auctioneer and ringmaster at approximately 35 auctions during the time he was receiving benefits. Hopfauf v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 94, 610 N.W.2d 60, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 99</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>

   While the Bureau should have stated more specifically why it discounted medical evidence in the claimant’s favor regarding his inability to willfully make false statements to the Bureau, the weight of the evidence supported the Bureau’s finding that the claimant could indeed act willfully, for example, when he operated a forklift, did landscaping, operated a Bobcat, did concrete finishing, worked with sheet metal, worked on garage doors, did bookkeeping work for his business, and made bank deposits. Horob v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 114, 611 N.W.2d 875, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>

   Bureau did not err in finding that claimant willfully made material false statements in his claims to the Bureau for reimbursement of mileage for doctors visits where claimant’s niece’s testimony about the trips along with other circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support that finding by a preponderance of the evidence.

       </p>
       <p>

   Claimant willfully made false statements in connection with his claim where he failed to report activities as work, within the common understanding of work, and failed to report income from those activities under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-08" target="_self">65-05-08</a></cite>(3), both of which impeded the Bureau’s process of determining eligibility.

   If the bureau is seeking forfeiture of future benefits, a false claim or false statement is sufficiently material if it is a statement which could have misled the bureau or medical experts in a determination of the claim. Hausauer v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1997 ND 243, 572 N.W.2d 426, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 305</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Claimant’s false statements regarding an injury occurring in 1995 did not justify termination of all future benefits related to a 1975 injury as those false statements could not have misled the Bureau or medical experts in determination of the earlier claim because the statements had nothing to do with the claimant’s continuing need for medical expense benefits related to that injury. Horob v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 114, 611 N.W.2d 875, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where the Bureau found claimant willfully made false statements in connection with a claim, and those false statements were material and misled the Bureau in awarding him benefits, the record supported the Bureau’s finding that claimant forfeited any additional benefits because that he willfully made material false statements in his claims for reimbursement and not because he made a minor or innocent mistake. Aalund v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2001 ND 32, 622 N.W.2d 210, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 2001).

       <p>

   Where appellant submitted a claim for benefits to North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) asserting that he injured his lower back while employed as a baker, he falsely indicated on the injury report that he had no prior lower back injuries; however, his medical records and chiropractic treatment records showed that he had sustained prior lower back injury in a car accident. The Supreme Court of North Dakota upheld WSI’s decision requiring appellant to forfeit future benefits under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-33" target="_self">65-05-33</a></cite> and to reimburse $11,500.47 for benefits WSI previously paid; appellant’s willful false statements were material and actually caused benefits to be paid in error.

   There are differing materiality tests used to prove the materiality of a willful false statement dependent upon which civil penalty — the civil penalty of reimbursement of benefits paid and the civil penalty of forfeiture of future benefits — is sought by the bureau. Hausauer v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1997 ND 243, 572 N.W.2d 426, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 305</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>

   Two materiality tests are applied to false claims or statements under this section: if the bureau seeks reimbursement for benefits paid, the level of materiality required is proof by the bureau that the false claim or statement caused the benefits to be paid in error; however, if the bureau is seeking only forfeiture of future benefits, no such causal connection is required and a false claim or statement is sufficiently material for forfeiture if it could mislead the bureau or medical experts in a determination of the claim. Wanner v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2002 ND 201, 654 N.W.2d 760, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 272</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>

   While a failure to report income from work is material to the workers compensation bureau’s ability to determine a claimant’s entitlement to benefits and to calculate the amount of benefits, a failure to report money received apart from work is not similarly material. Wanner v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2002 ND 201, 654 N.W.2d 760, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 272</cite> (N.D. 2002).

     <p>
      For purposes of this section, “preferred worker” means a worker who has incurred a compensable injury that resulted in a disability that poses a substantial obstacle to employment. The organization may provide assistance as determined appropriate to preferred workers or employers who employ a preferred worker. In addition, employers who apply for and are approved as a preferred worker employer may not be assessed premiums on a preferred worker’s salary for three years from the date of hiring. The organization may not charge claims costs incurred as a result of an injury sustained by a preferred worker against the preferred worker’s employer’s account during the first three years after the worker is hired. The organization shall charge those claims costs to the general fund. The organization may adopt rules to regulate and manage the preferred worker program authorized by this section. An employer or preferred worker may not appeal an organization decision not to provide assistance to that employer or preferred worker under this section. Money in the workforce safety and insurance fund is appropriated on a continuing basis to provide the assistance authorized under this section.

       Death of permanently and totally disabled employee — Surviving spouse.

     <p>
      In the case of the death of an injured employee who is receiving permanent total disability benefits, or additional benefits payable, if the injured employee was permanently and totally disabled for at least ten years and was married to the surviving spouse for at least ten years, the decedent’s surviving spouse is eligible to receive no more than six months of the decedent’s permanent total disability benefits, supplementary benefits, and additional benefits payable in the same manner as the deceased spouse would have been entitled to receive the benefits. A surviving spouse is eligible for benefits under this section if the organization approved the decedent for home health care services and reimbursed the surviving spouse for providing the home health care services. The surviving spouse is not eligible for benefits under this section if the surviving spouse is eligible for benefits under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-16" target="_self">65-05-16</a></cite>. The eligibility of the surviving spouse to receive benefits under this section terminates upon the remarriage of the surviving spouse.

       It is the goal of vocational rehabilitation to return the disabled employee to substantial gainful employment with a minimum of retraining, as soon as possible after an injury occurs. “Substantial gainful employment” means bona fide work, for remuneration, which is reasonably attainable in light of the individual’s injury, functional capacities, education, previous occupation, experience, and transferable skills, and which offers an opportunity to restore the injured employee as soon as practicable and as nearly as possible to ninety percent of the injured employee’s average weekly wage, or to sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average weekly wage in the state on the date the rehabilitation report is issued under section 65-05.1-02.1, whichever is less. The purpose of defining substantial gainful employment in terms of earnings is to determine the first appropriate priority option under subsection 4 which meets this income test set out above.

A vocational rehabilitation allowance does not accrue as weeks of temporary total disability as defined in section 65-01-02 if the employee successfully completes a retraining program approved by the organization. If the employee fails to successfully complete a retraining program approved by the organization, the vocational rehabilitation allowance paid accrues against the maximum number of weeks of temporary total disability allowed pursuant to section 65-01-02. If an employee attempts and withdraws from an approved retraining program within the first twenty weeks following commencement of the retraining program, the employee, upon request, may receive no more than one hundred eighty-two weeks of temporary partial disability benefits calculated pursuant to subdivision c of subsection 6.

   The 1992 limitations on vocational rehabilitation retraining benefits under this section did not violate claimant’s equal protection rights under either the federal constitution or

   N.D. Const., Art. I, § 21. Baldock v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 554 N.W.2d 441, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 223</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>

   The 75% income limitation in subsection (3) (amended in 1995 to 662/3%) for returning injured workers to substantial gainful employment under this section is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose and therefore does not violate the equal protection clause of the

   Eagle v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 154, 583 N.W.2d 97, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1998).

   Claimant seeking disability and rehabilitative benefits did not have to prove that the work-related injury was the sole cause of her disability or even that it was a primary cause of that disability. To the contrary, the work injury need only have been a substantial contributing factor to the disability. Holtz v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 479 N.W.2d 469, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>

   The Workers Compensation Bureau’s finding that the employee could physically perform duties as an accounting clerk was supported by the preponderance of the evidence. Held v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 540 N.W.2d 166, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>

   The preponderance of the evidence supported the workers compensation bureau’s finding that the accounting clerk field for which the employee being trained would likely have employment which would be reasonably attainable upon the completion of his training.

   The worker’s average weekly earnings at the time of the injury constitute a reasonable formula for calculating earning capacity. Smith v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 447 N.W.2d 250, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1989) (decided prior to the 1989 amendments to this chapter).
       </p>
       <p>

   Subsection (3) requires only that the job market present an opportunity for the employee to obtain a salary that comes as nearly as possible to the average weekly wage. Held v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 540 N.W.2d 166, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>

   One of the rehabilitative goals of North Dakota’s workforce safety and insurance law was to return a disabled employee to substantial gainful employee with a minimum of retraining, as soon as possible after an injury has occurred, according to

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>(3). Since the evidence presented in the claimant’s case showed that the claimant could go to work as a store greeter despite wrist and shoulder pain the claimant had experienced in the claimant’s prior job, the evidence showed that the claimant had a residual earning capacity of $ 290 per week and was consistent with the establishment of earning capacity pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-10" target="_self">65-05-10</a></cite>(3). Johnson v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins. Fund, 2012 ND 87, 816 N.W.2d 74, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>

   Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in finding that an employee had a retained earnings capacity of zero because the ALJ misapplied the law by too broadly interpreting the term “valid”; the functional capacity evaluation, which noted that the employee gave a reliable effort, was “valid,” and the presumption of a retained earnings capacity was triggered, but the ALJ did not find by clear and convincing evidence that the presumption had been rebutted.

   State v. Taylor, 2019 ND 220, 932 N.W.2d 764, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       </h5>
       <p>
        For the purpose of subsection (3), the legislature unambiguously intended “earnings” and “wages” to be interpreted synonymously. Lucier v. North Dakota Workers Comp. Bureau, 556 N.W.2d 56 (N.D. 1996).

   This chapter does not require that the Workers’ Compensation Bureau’s rehabilitation plan guarantee plaintiff a job upon completion of the program. Thompson v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 490 N.W.2d 248, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rehabilitation plan gave claimant a reasonable opportunity to obtain substantial gainful employment in the state, and the fact some of the jobs claimant applied for may have required physical demands beyond the medium classification he was assigned under the plan did not make the plan unfeasible; neither a rehabilitation plan nor a vocational consultant can guarantee a claimant a job or a particular wage. Lucier v. North Dakota Workers Comp. Bureau, 556 N.W.2d 56 (N.D. 1996).

   Where proffered employment as truck driver was at the same rate as worker had previously earned, and offered the opportunity to meet the wage threshold under the statute, because worker failed to make a good faith work trial in the job, her argument she could not drive enough miles to meet the wage threshold was purely speculative and did not excuse her failure to make a good faith work trial. Maginn v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 550 N.W.2d 412, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 1996).

   Where the bureau’s findings disclosed that claimant was not in a position to secure substantial gainful employment during the interim between the date of termination of his disability payments, and the beginning of his teaching position, and that during this interim he was disabled to the extent that he could not return to his previous employment or like employment, the bureau erred in its denial of disability and vocational rehabilitation benefits for the interim. Ehrmantraut v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 469 N.W.2d 557, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   Bureau found that worker is now capable of performing unskilled laborer jobs in the “medium work” category that would give him earnings of about $4.50 an hour, which is the amount that he was receiving at the time of his injury, and that such jobs are available. The bureau correctly concluded that worker was not entitled to receive retraining, because the first appropriate option under the section was for him to return to a related occupation in the local or statewide job pool. Emery v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 477 N.W.2d 202, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 1991).

Hoffman v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 66, 592 N.W.2d 533, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>

   Worker’s compensation bureau’s finding that claimant’s employer offered him a legitimate post-injury position was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Baldock v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 554 N.W.2d 441, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 223</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>

   North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance did not err in concluding that N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>(4)(e) was the first appropriate rehabilitation option based on an employee’s abilities where merely eliminating the need to lift large dogs by installing a $ 10,000 hoist mechanism would not necessarily allow the employee to perform her prior duties as a dog groomer. The employee’s projected income in another area of work would exceed her pre-injury income from the employer.

   Victor v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2006 ND 68, 711 N.W.2d 188, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a worker’s compensation matter, several experts testified as to a claimant’s ability to obtain gainful employment as defined under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>(3). A preponderance of evidence supported the decision to terminate the claimant’s benefits because it was for the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance to weigh the credibility of the medical evidence and resolve conflicting medical opinions.

   Miller v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2009 ND 109, 767 N.W.2d 154, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 2009).

   ALJ’s finding that an injured employee was capable of performing the job of sheet metal worker identified in his vocational rehabilitation plan was supported by a preponderance of the evidence where his testimony, the testimony of his vocational manager, and the physical requirements of the job listed in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles established that kneeling was not a common job requirement. Beam v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins. Fund, 2020 ND 168, 946 N.W.2d 486, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite> (N.D. 2020).

   A vocational rehabilitation plan must take into account all of the injured worker’s functional limitations which existed at the time of the injury, not just those limitations directly caused by the current work injury. Svedberg v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 181, 599 N.W.2d 323, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>

   Decision that a benefits claimant was able to return to work on a part-time basis was upheld on review because a vocational rehabilitation plan took into account the fact that the claimant had a preexisting hearing loss when it developed the plan; the proposed jobs considered the claimant’s prior 25 years in law enforcement and his explanation of the disability.

   Genter v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins. Fund, 2006 ND 237, 724 N.W.2d 132, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 2006).

   The purpose of a vocational retraining program is to substantially rehabilitate a worker to his pre-injury earning capacity. Smith v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 447 N.W.2d 250, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1989) (decided prior to the 1989 amendments to this chapter).
       </p>

   A claimant is substantially rehabilitated if he can be employed to within ten percent of his pre-injury earning capacity, so that he is able, upon completion of the retraining program, to be employed at least at ninety percent of his pre-injury earning capacity.

   As S.L. 1989, chapter 771, amending and reenacting portions of this chapter, did not clearly express an intent that the amendments were to apply retroactively, the amendments must be applied only prospectively.

   The workers compensation bureau reasonably found that the claimant was not entitled to rehabilitation benefits, where the claimant was aggressively searching for alternative suitable employment, and even though it was not successful, the search indicated that she had marketable skills.

   Trial court erred in upholding an order terminating an employee’s total disability benefits and awarding the employee partial disability benefits where the employee could not be returned to substantial gainful employment, as defined in

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>(3), and did not have a retained earnings capacity to meet the income test of

   N.D.C.C. § 65-05.1-01(3) and did not have a retained earnings capacity to meet

   N.D.C.C. § 65-05.1-01(3), then the injured worker was entitled to temporary total disability benefits or permanent total disability benefits.

   Former ranch foreman thrown from a horse injured his left hip and pelvis, resulting in separation of pelvic cartilage. The bureau correctly ruled foreman was a candidate for vocational rehabilitation and was not entitled to lump sum payment of disability benefits where record contained no medical opinion saying that foreman’s physical condition and chronic pain precluded education and retraining.

       <p>

   Evidence supported finding that an injured claimant refused to participate in rehabilitation options that were available to him; as such, the district court properly affirmed the Workforce Safety and Insurance order that terminated the award of rehabilitation benefits and partial disability benefits, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>.

   Workplace Safety and Insurance (WSI) appropriately exercised its continuing jurisdiction on its own motion, under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05s65-05-04" target="_self">65-05-04</a></cite>, to assess a claimant’s vocational rehabilitation and that the claimant was properly found in noncompliance with vocational rehabilitation; N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>(8)(a) also provided that WSI could initiate vocational rehabilitation services on its own motion.

   Because the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) vocational rehabilitation plan to return a claimant to the same occupation with any employer was appropriate under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-01" target="_self">65-05.1-01</a></cite>, where its goal was tailored to return claimant to substantial gainful employment which was reasonably attainable in light of claimant’s injury and which would substantially rehabilitate claimant’s earning capacity, the WSI adequately explained its reasons for disregarding medical evidence favorable to claimant, and its specific findings were supported by the evidence, a judgment denying claimant further benefits was affirmed.

   Shotbolt v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2010 ND 13, 777 N.W.2d 853, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 2010).

   Administrative law judge’s finding that the claimant was capable of performing the return-to-work options identified in her vocational rehabilitation plan was supported by a preponderance of the evidence, because the claimant’s treating neurologist was aware of her psychological impairments and treatments, and approved the identified return-to-work options.

       </p>
       <p>

   North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) erred in finding that the employee failed to show that his wage loss was the result of his compensable left shoulder injury because the fact that his noncompensable vertebral artery occlusion made it impractical for him to either return to work or undergo surgery necessary to return him to employment did not break the causal connection, the employee had not unreasonably refused to undergo surgery for his left shoulder injury, and WSI's notice of intention to discontinue/reduce benefits seemed to foreclose a functional capacity assessment.

   ALJ's conclusion that an injured worker's vocational rehabilitation plan was valid and properly considered his neck pain was affirmed where a treating physician's release of the worker to his pre-injury occupation allowed Workforce Safety and Insurance to reasonably conclude the worker was capable of performing his pre-injury occupation.

   ALJ adequately addressed the inconsistencies in the medical opinions, provided a reasonable basis for her findings, and sufficiently explained the reasoning for her conclusion to disregard the medical evidence offered by another physician.

   District court properly affirmed an order by Workforce Safety and Insurance because an employee was given a presumably viable rehabilitation option, his arguments concerning the cost of relocating or commuting were not ripe for review, his documented preexisting conditions were taken into account, and detailed findings were made with respect to his vocational rehabilitation plan.

   North Dakota Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance is not automatically required to establish a medical assessment team and seek a medical opinion in every case in which a worker claims an injury or preexisting condition, regardless of the factual basis for the worker’s claim; therefore, a decision not to establish a medical assessment team was not erroneous in a case where a benefits claimant had a preexisting hearing loss because the claimant was able to describe the disability, he was able to communicate with others throughout the course of his vocational plan development, and he was able to work for 25 years in law enforcement with the use of hearing aids.

If the employee fails to perform a good-faith work trial or work search, the organization may not pay additional disability benefits unless the employee meets the criteria for reapplying for benefits required under subsection 1 of section 65-05-08. If the employee meets the burden of proving that the employee made a good-faith work trial or work search and that the work trial or work search was unsuccessful due to the injury, the organization shall re-evaluate the employee’s vocational rehabilitation claim.

The employee shall show that the injury significantly impacts the employee’s ability to successfully compete for gainful employment in that the injury leads employers to favor those without limitations over the employee. If, without good cause, the injured employee fails to attend specific vocational testing, remedial, or other vocational services determined necessary by the organization, the employee is in noncompliance with vocational rehabilitation. If, without good cause, the injured employee fails to attend a scheduled medical or vocational assessment, fails to communicate or cooperate with the organization, or fails to attend a specific qualified rehabilitation program within ten days from the date the rehabilitation program commences, the employee is in noncompliance with vocational rehabilitation. If, without good cause, the employee discontinues a training program in which the employee is enrolled, the employee is in noncompliance with vocational rehabilitation. If at any time the employee is noncompliant without good cause, subsequent efforts by the employee to come into compliance with vocational rehabilitation are not considered successful compliance until the employee has successfully returned to the job or training program for a period of thirty days. In all cases of noncompliance by the employee, the organization shall discontinue disability and vocational rehabilitation benefits. If the period of noncompliance continues for thirty days following the date benefits are discontinued, or a second instance of noncompliance occurs without good cause, the organization may not pay any further disability or vocational rehabilitation benefits, regardless of whether the employee sustained a significant change in medical condition due to the work injury.

   Where claimant was advised to return to work by her physician, she was obligated under this section to make herself available for modified work arranged for her before the bureau had any obligation to consider the necessity and feasibility of a rehabilitation program. Her failure to do so was noncompliance with this section and prevented the bureau from assessing or testing her capability to work and her need for rehabilitation. Risch v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 447 N.W.2d 308, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1989) (decided prior to the 1989 amendments to this chapter).

   Workers compensation bureau’s finding worker was capable of performing modified job was supported by a preponderance of the evidence, where there was substantial medical evidence indicating worker was physically capable of performing, doctor who conducted independent medical examination specifically concluded modified position was within her physical abilities, and worker relied upon note of her doctor which contained no documentation or objective medical findings to support his cursory conclusion she could not perform.

   The Workers Compensation Bureau’s conclusion that financial inability cannot constitute good cause for noncompliance with a rehabilitation plan is not in accordance with the law. Fuhrman v.

   Claimant presented good cause for failing to comply with his rehabilitation plan, in that he did not have the financial ability to relocate and attend an out-of-state training program. Fuhrman v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1997 ND 191, 569 N.W.2d 269, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 237</cite> (N.D. 1997).

   Worker whose request for a second domicile allowance was wrongfully denied by the Workers Compensation Bureau had good cause for his failure to attend a rehabilitation program located so far from the worker’s residence that it was not possible to commute to the program. Hoffman v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 66, 592 N.W.2d 533, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 1999).

   Whether a worker has good cause not to attend an approved rehabilitation program turns on whether a reasonable and prudent person under the same or similar circumstances would have failed to comply. Hoffman v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1999 ND 66, 592 N.W.2d 533, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>

   Employee did not show good cause for failing to comply with a vocational rehabilitation plan because it was fundamental error for an administrative law judge to conclude that the employee did not have to comply until the employee’s appeal of an order establishing the plan was determined, as (1) the employee did not assert this as a ground for noncompliance, and (2) the employee was not relieved of compliance, absent a stay, until the appeal was resolved. Inwards v. N.D. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2014 ND 163, 851 N.W.2d 693, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 2014).

   Claimant’s willful failure to give a maximum consistent effort during a functional capacity evaluation can constitute an act of noncompliance with a vocational rehabilitation plan under this section. Hoffman v. N.D. Workers Comp. Bureau, 2002 ND 138, 651 N.W.2d 601, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>

   Court properly upheld an order from the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) denying further disability and vocational rehabilitation benefits to an employee because the results of a functional capacity assessment on the employee represented a manipulated effort and an invalid representation of the employee’s physical capabilities. Finding of noncompliance under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-04" target="_self">65-05.1-04</a></cite>(6) was proven by the weight of the evidence on the entire record.

       </p>
       <p>

   Workforce Safety and Insurance’s (WSI) decision to discontinue a worker’s benefits was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

   The worker, who claimed that she was unable to drive to Fargo for the independent medical examination (IME), failed to provide sufficient evidence of a good cause for her failure to attend the IME.

   Her failure constituted noncompliance with

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-05.1s65-05.1-04" target="_self">65-05.1-04</a></cite>(6) and prevented WSI from assessing her capability to work and her need for rehabilitation.

   The purpose of a vocational retraining program is to substantially rehabilitate a worker to his pre-injury earning capacity. Smith v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 447 N.W.2d 250, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1989) (decided prior to the 1989 amendments to this chapter).
       </p>
       <p>

   A claimant is substantially rehabilitated if he can be employed to within ten percent of his pre-injury earning capacity, so that he is able, upon completion of the retraining program, to be employed at least at ninety percent of his pre-injury earning capacity. Smith v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 447 N.W.2d 250, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1989) (decided prior to the 1989 amendments to this chapter).

If additional services are determined to be necessary as a result of failed or inappropriate rehabilitation of an injured employee through no fault of the employee, the organization may contract with the vendor for additional services.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The organization may implement a system of pilot programs to allow the organization to assess alternative methods of providing rehabilitation services. A pilot program may address one or more of the organization’s comprehensive rehabilitation services, including vocational, medical, psychological, economic, and social rehabilitation services. The goal of a pilot program must be to improve the outcome of the rehabilitation services offered by the organization to assist the injured employee in making adjustments necessitated from the employee’s injury and to improve the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation services in returning an employee to substantial gainful employment. Notwithstanding laws to the contrary, a pilot program may address a broad range of approaches, including collaborative efforts between the organization and the injured employee through which there are variances from the rehabilitation services hierarchy; return-to-work trial periods during which cash benefits are suspended; intensive job search assistance; recognition of and focused services for injured employees who are at risk; and coordination of services of public and private entities. If a pilot program utilizes coordination of services of other state agencies, such as job service North Dakota, department of human services, North Dakota university system, or department of public instruction, the organization shall consult with the state agency in establishing the relevant portions of the pilot program and the state agency shall cooperate with the organization in implementing the pilot program. The organization shall provide status reports on current pilot programs in accordance with section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-19" target="_self">65-01-19</a></cite>.

       Rehabilitation services pilot programs — Reports. [Effective September 1, 2022]
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The organization may implement a system of pilot programs to allow the organization to assess alternative methods of providing rehabilitation services. A pilot program may address one or more of the organization’s comprehensive rehabilitation services, including vocational, medical, psychological, economic, and social rehabilitation services. The goal of a pilot program must be to improve the outcome of the rehabilitation services offered by the organization to assist the injured employee in making adjustments necessitated from the employee’s injury and to improve the effectiveness of vocational rehabilitation services in returning an employee to substantial gainful employment. Notwithstanding laws to the contrary, a pilot program may address a broad range of approaches, including collaborative efforts between the organization and the injured employee through which there are variances from the rehabilitation services hierarchy; return-to-work trial periods during which cash benefits are suspended; intensive job search assistance; recognition of and focused services for injured employees who are at risk; and coordination of services of public and private entities. If a pilot program utilizes coordination of services of other state agencies, such as job service North Dakota, department of health and human services, North Dakota university system, or department of public instruction, the organization shall consult with the state agency in establishing the relevant portions of the pilot program and the state agency shall cooperate with the organization in implementing the pilot program. The organization shall provide status reports on current pilot programs in accordance with section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-01s65-01-19" target="_self">65-01-19</a></cite>.

Until rehabilitation options were considered and rejected, she could not be found permanently and totally disabled and therefore eligible for supplementary benefits. The fact that the committee should have determined claimant’s status 15 months earlier and that it violated its own internal operating procedures did not warrant reversal of the decision in the absence of evidence of a persistent pattern of improper agency conduct.

     <p>
      The term “volunteer firefighter” means any active member of an organized volunteer fire department of this state and any other individual performing services as a volunteer firefighter for a municipality at the request of the chief or other individual in command of the fire department of that municipality or of any other officer of that municipality having authority to demand service as a firefighter. Firefighters who are paid a regular wage or stipend by the municipality for serving as a firefighter, or whose entire time is devoted to service as a firefighter for the municipality, for the purpose of this chapter, are not volunteer firefighters.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “emergency or disaster volunteer” means any individual serving without remuneration who is actively engaged in training to qualify as a disaster emergency worker or is responding to a hazard, emergency disaster, or enemy attack on this country, and who is registered with the disaster emergency organization of a municipality, which has been officially recognized by the director of the state division of homeland security.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “in training” means only those periods of time, during which an emergency or disaster volunteer is receiving instruction, or is engaged in exercises or operations, in preparation for qualification as a disaster emergency worker in the event of a hazard, emergency, disaster, or enemy attack on this country.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “community emergency response team member” means an individual registered as a community emergency response team member with the appropriate authority. For purposes of this chapter, a community emergency response team member is acting as a community emergency response team member only when the individual is receiving approved community emergency response team training or is acting as a member of a community emergency response team in an emergency or disaster.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon request of the organization, the disaster emergency organization of a municipality shall provide the organization with its roster of registered community emergency response team members.
     </p>
     <p>
      The term “municipality” when used in reference to emergency or disaster volunteer means the state, cities, counties, municipalities, districts, or any other geographical entity of this state. This definition is not in any way intended to alter any interpretation or ruling in regard to the use of the term municipality when used in reference to volunteer firefighters.

      For the purpose of making assessments of premiums to be charged against municipalities for protection of volunteer firefighters, emergency or disaster volunteers, volunteer health practitioners, and community emergency response team members, the organization shall make such survey as may seem advisable to ascertain the probable annual expenditures necessary to be paid out of the fund to carry out this chapter, and shall fix the annual charges and assessments which must be made against municipalities employing volunteer firefighters, emergency or disaster volunteers, volunteer health practitioners, and community emergency response team members. The charge must be a fixed sum for each one hundred of the population of the municipality involved and uniform as to all such involved municipalities but in proportion to the population of the municipality. In determining the amount of premium charge, the organization may apply the system of experience rating provided in this title, as applied to other risks. The organization may establish a minimum charge or assessment to be applicable to any municipality for which the fixed rate or charge multiplied by the number of hundreds of the population of the municipality would amount to less than the amount of the minimum charge or assessment. The population of a municipality shall be that shown by the latest official North Dakota state or United States government census, whichever may be the later.

      For the purposes of sections 65-06.2-02 and 65-06.2-03, an “inmate” is a person who is confined against the inmate’s will in a city or county penal institution or is a person who, as a criminal defendant before a court, is ordered or elects to perform public service for a city or county in conjunction with or in lieu of a jail sentence. The term “inmate” does not include an individual injured while incarcerated in the North Dakota state penitentiary or any of its affiliated facilities or an individual injured in a fight, riot, recreational activity, or other incident not directly related to the inmate’s work assignment.

   If there is no contract for extraterritoral coverage between an employer and the bureau, the bureau’s responsibility for compensating injuries occurring outside of North Dakota is limited by the terms of this section. North Dakota.

   Souris River Tel. Mut. Aid Coop. v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 471 N.W.2d 465, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>

   Subsection (1)(b) of the statute allows compensation for injuries occurring outside this state if the employee is engaged in a service which is “incidental to and is referable to the principal employment, the situs of which is within North Dakota.” However, subsection (2) of the statute modified subsection (1)(b) by declaring that services rendered are not incidental and referable to the North Dakota employment, if the injury is sustained at an “identifiable out-of-state jobsite.” North Dakota. Souris River Tel. Mut. Aid Coop. v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 471 N.W.2d 465, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   The “identifiable out-of-state jobsite” provision was added to this section in 1989 at the request of the bureau. It is obvious from the legislative history that the purpose of the amendment was to prevent employers from taking advantage of North Dakota’s favorable workers compensation rates while having their employees work in another state without obtaining and paying premiums for out-of-state coverage. North Dakota. Souris River Tel. Mut. Aid Coop. v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 471 N.W.2d 465, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   Injured employee had a right to bring a tort action against an employer for personal injuries which the employee suffered while working for the employer, which incorrectly classified the employee as an independent contractor, because the exclusive remedy provisions of the North Dakota workers' compensation laws did not preclude the action under provisions authorizing the action for the employer willfully misrepresenting to an insurer the amount of payroll upon which a premium was based, or for willfully failing to secure coverage for employees.

      The organization is subrogated to the recovery made in the action against the uninsured employer. The subrogation interest is determined according to section 65-01-09, with the uninsured employer being the person other than the fund with a legal liability to pay damages with respect to the employee’s injury or death. An injured employee, or the dependents of an employee who died as a result of a work-related accident, shall file the original claim for compensation within one year after the injury or within two years after the death. The organization shall notify the claimant and the employer that the matter is being processed under this chapter, and subsequently shall hear and determine the application for compensation as it would for other claims before the organization. A determination by the organization that a person is not an employer required to obtain workforce safety and insurance coverage under this title is a defense to any claim that the person failed to obtain coverage for the time period during which the determination is effective.

   Common-law right of an injured employee to sue for damages when injured is not taken away by this statute, since he has an option of theories upon which to proceed. State ex rel. Workmen's Compensation Fund v. E. W. Wylie Co., 79 N.D. 471, 58 N.W.2d 76, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 55</cite> (N.D. 1953).
       </p>
       <p>

   Injured employee had a right to bring a tort action against an employer for personal injuries which the employee suffered while working for the employer, which incorrectly classified the employee as an independent contractor, because the exclusive remedy provisions of the North Dakota workers' compensation laws did not preclude the action under provisions authorizing the action for the employer willfully misrepresenting to an insurer the amount of payroll upon which a premium was based, or for willfully failing to secure coverage for employees. Vail v. S/L Servs., 2017 ND 202, 900 N.W.2d 271, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>

   Employer was entitled to supervisory writs directing a district court to grant the employer summary judgment barring civil liability for deceased and injured workers’ injuries because no fact question existed as to whether an exception to the employer’s immunity due to the employer reporting an inaccurate payroll to Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) applied, as WSI (1) found no such violation, (2) did not try to collect additional premiums, and (3) gave no notice that WSI processed the workers’ claims under N.D.C.C. ch. 65-09. Plains Trucking, LLC v. Hagar, 2019 ND 226, 932 N.W.2d 541, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   Where employee is injured in the course of his employment and at the time of the injury the employer is uninsured for workers’ compensation coverage, this section gives the employee the option of either pursuing a civil action against the employer or filing an application for workers’ compensation benefits; where such employee has not been awarded workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-09s65-09-03" target="_self">65-09-03</a></cite>, the option to pursue a civil action against the uninsured employer is not negated by fact that employer, subsequent to the injury, has paid the premiums, penalties and interest required by former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-09s65-09-04" target="_self">65-09-04</a></cite> (now N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-04s65-04-33" target="_self">65-04-33</a></cite>).

   Where injured workman, whose employer did not comply with workers’ compensation act, stipulated that negligence actions against employer would be dismissed, with prejudice, and district court entered order so dismissing negligence causes of action against employer, workman was not entitled to proceed with a further cause of action against employer for additional damages for employer’s noncompliance with Workers' Compensation Act.

      If the final action of the organization denies the right of the claimant to participate at all in the fund on the ground that the injury was self-inflicted, or on the ground that the accident did not arise in the course of employment, or upon any other ground going to the basis of the claim, or if the organization allows the claimant to participate in the fund to a lesser degree than that claimed by the claimant, if such allowance is less than the maximum allowance provided by this title, the claimant may appeal to the district court of the county wherein the injury was inflicted or of the county in which the claimant resides. An employer may also appeal a decision of the organization in any injury case or an organization decision issued under chapter 65-04, in the manner prescribed in this section. An appeal involving injuries allegedly covered by insurance provided under contracts with extraterritorial coverage shall be triable in the district court of Burleigh County. Any appeal under this section shall be taken in the manner provided in chapter 28-32. Any appeal to the district court shall be heard on the record, transmitted from the organization, and, in the discretion of the court, additional evidence may be presented pertaining to the questions of law involved in the appeal.

   District court properly dismissed a claimant’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he did not meet the statutory requirements to file the appeal in the county in which the injury occurred or the county in which he resided, the Workforce Safety and Insurance had a statutory lien on the claimant’s third party recovery, and he did not pay any of the sums secured by the lien as statutorily required.

   In determining whether the bureau’s findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the supreme court does not make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency. It determines only whether a reasonable mind could have determined that the factual conclusions were proved by the weight of the evidence from the entire record. Westman v.

   Because this section specifically provides for jurisdiction for appeals from final action of the workers compensation bureau, either in the county of residence of the claimant or the county wherein the injury was inflicted, former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-15" target="_blank">28-32-15</a></cite> (now N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-42" target="_blank">28-32-42</a></cite>) is inapposite in the instance in which the injury occurs in this state, and jurisdiction for appeal does not lie in the county where the hearing is held. Boyko v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 409 N.W.2d 638, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 379</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   By denying future benefits, the workers compensation bureau denied the claimant the right to participate in the fund not only presently but also in the future, although he might well be entitled to participate in the fund in the future if his medical condition should change; thus, his appeal of the bureau’s order denying further benefits was authorized. Lass v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 415 N.W.2d 796, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   Absent an appeal from an order denying benefits, a workers compensation bureau decision not to reopen a claim for consideration of new or additional evidence of medical condition at the time of a denial which is sought to be reopened is not appealable, but a bureau decision not to reopen a claim upon a request based upon a change in the claimant’s medical condition since the original decision is appealable. Lass v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 415 N.W.2d 796, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   A claimant’s time for appeal does not begin to run until a notice of decision is given by the worker’s compensation bureau. Tooley v. Alm, 515 N.W.2d 137, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>

   The 30-day appeal period never began to run because the Workers Compensation Bureau never served claimant with a notice of a final determination upon reconsideration after the order become final, and thus claimant’s appeal was timely. Lende v. N.D. Workers' Comp. Bureau, 1997 ND 178, 568 N.W.2d 755, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1997).

   District court had no power, under the predecessor to this section, to tax and allow an attorney’s fee, except in a case where an appeal was taken from a final action of the bureau in denying the right of claimant to participate at all in the workers’ compensation fund. Wallace v. Workmen’s Comp.

   Trial court erred in affirming the decision of Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance (WSI) to pay a claimant only $9,876 for costs and attorney’s fees after he won his appeal to have his benefits reinstated, based upon the maximum amount WSI could pay under the fee cap in N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-02s65-02-08" target="_self">65-02-08</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-10s65-10-03" target="_self">65-10-03</a></cite>, because the general attorney fee provision for administrative actions, N.D.C.C.§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_blank">28-32-50</a></cite>, could apply to WSI cases where the claimant alleged that WSI acted without substantial justification in reducing or denying benefits. Therefore, the case was remanded for a determination as to whether the WSI acted without substantial justification warranting an additional award of attorney’s fees under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_blank">28-32-50</a></cite>.

   Judgment of court awarding interest in compensation case, assuming interest is not allowable under compensation act, is not void and is not subject to collateral attack. Hanson v.

   District court cannot award attorney’s fees in proceeding to obtain writ of mandamus to allow inspection of records of bureau. Wallace v. Workmen’s Comp. Bureau, 70 N.D. 193, 293 N.W. 192 (1940), decided prior to the enactment of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t65c65-10s65-10-03" target="_self">65-10-03</a></cite>; distinguished, Boe v.

   The costs of taking depositions and subpoenaing expert witnesses for cross-examination, being not a part of the “appeal” process, are not set by the appellate court but are governed by former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-09" target="_blank">28-32-09</a></cite> (now N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-33" target="_blank">28-32-33</a></cite>).

   Although an injured worker was denied workers’ compensation, his appeal, challenging an agency decision that his injury while traveling home from work was not in the course of employment, was not frivolous and attorney’s fees would be awarded.

   What is reasonable attorney’s fee in any given proceeding was matter primarily for trial court to determine, and such determination would not be disturbed on appeal unless it was clearly wrong.
