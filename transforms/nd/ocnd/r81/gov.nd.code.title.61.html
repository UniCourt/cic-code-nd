   There is no absolute ownership of groundwater underlying land if water has not actually been diverted and applied to beneficial use, and thus landowner does not have vested right to unused groundwater underlying his land, but only usufructuary right and its existence is contingent upon application of underlying water to beneficial use; declaration that all waters in the state belong to public and may be appropriated through proper administrative procedure is valid exercise of the state’s police power, insofar as it does not expropriate vested rights; where landowner had no vested right, enactment of this provision did not violate Article I, § 16 of state constitution or fourteenth amendment of the Federal Constitution.Baeth v.

       Findings and declaration of policy — Use of ground water for irrigation.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds that the use of ground water for irrigation purposes is vitally important to the economic future of this state. The reliance on processing plants for the consistent quality resulting from irrigation is an important factor in preserving this state’s reputation for quality agricultural production. Therefore, it is declared necessary and in the public interest that the state by and through the state water commission strongly discourages the conversion of agricultural water permits to any other use. Further, the legislative assembly declares that any feasible or reasonable alternative supply of water be made available for municipal or domestic use to enable the continued use of ground water for irrigated agriculture and agricultural processing.

      In all cases of claims to the use of water initiated prior to March 1, 1905, the right relates back to the initiation of the claim, upon the diligent prosecution to completion of the necessary surveys and construction for the application of the water to a beneficial use. Any claim to the use of water initiated after March 1, 1905, relates back to the date of receipt of an application for the claim in the department of water resources or the department’s predecessor, subject to compliance with applicable statutes, rules, and regulations.

       Watercourse — Definition.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A watercourse entitled to the protection of the law is constituted if there is a sufficient natural and accustomed flow of water to form and maintain a distinct and a defined channel. The supply of water is not required to be continuous or from a perennial living source. The criteria for constituting a watercourse are satisfied if the flow arises periodically from natural causes and reaches a plainly defined channel of a permanent character. If requested by a water resource board, the department of water resources shall determine whether a watercourse is constituted.

     <p>
      In view of legislative findings and determination of the ever-increasing demand and anticipated future need for water in North Dakota for every beneficial purpose and use, it is hereby declared to be the water resources policy of the state that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-01s61-01-26ol11">
       The public health, safety, and general welfare, including without limitation, enhancement of opportunities for social and economic growth and expansion, of all of the people of the state, depend in large measure upon the optimum protection, management, and wise utilization of all of the water and related land resources of the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-01s61-01-26ol12">
       Well-being of all of the people of the state shall be the overriding determinant in considering the best use, or combination of uses, of water and related land resources.

      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-01s61-01-26ol14">
       Accruing benefits from these resources can best be achieved for the people of the state through the development, execution, and periodic updating of comprehensive, coordinated, and well-balanced short-term and long-term plans and programs for the conservation and development of such resources by the departments and agencies of the state having responsibilities therefor. The plans and programs for the conservation and development of these resources may include implementation of a program to cost-share with local sponsors of water quality improvement projects.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-01s61-01-26ol15">
       Adequate implementation of such plans and programs shall be provided by the state through cost-sharing and cooperative participation with the appropriate federal and state departments and agencies and political subdivisions within the limitation of budgetary requirements and administrative capabilities, including consideration of cost-sharing for water quality improvement projects.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-01s61-01-26ol16">
       Required assurances of state cooperation and for meeting nonfederal repayment obligations of the state in connection with federal-assisted state projects shall be provided by the appropriate state department or agency.

       Required assurances of local cooperation and for meeting nonfederal repayment obligations of local interests in connection with federal-assisted local projects may, at the request of political subdivisions or other local interests be provided by the appropriate state department or agency, provided, if for any reason it is deemed necessary by any department or agency of the state to expend state funds in order to fulfill any obligation of a political subdivision or other local interests in connection with the construction, operation, or maintenance of any such project, the state shall have and may enforce a claim against the political subdivision or other local interests for such expenditures.

      <p>

   Whether a particular pronouncement is a finding of fact or a conclusion of law will be determined by the reviewing court, and labels are not conclusive; therefore, the state engineer’s “conclusion” about the project’s impact on water quality was a finding of fact and was amply supported by evidence. In re Application for Permits to Drain Related to Stone Creek Channel Improv. etc., 424 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        Water Quality.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   The greater weight of evidence showed that drainage project would not cause a significant decrease in water quality, where the state conservationist made a detailed study of relevant reports, there was evidence that any decrease in water quality would not continue for more than a few years after the beginning of wetland drainage, and the state engineer determined that several features of the drainage project for which permits were sought would protect against undue degradation of water quality during that time. In re Application for Permits to Drain Related to Stone Creek Channel Improv. etc., 424 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <b>
        Wetlands.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   The state engineer found that there were many wetlands in the assessment area in addition to type IV wetlands, and determined that harm to wildlife and consequently, recreation, would be small; thus, the state engineer sufficiently considered how the project would affect fish and wildlife values, since he was not required to make separate findings regarding each distinct category of wetlands and the resultant effect of their drainage on fish and wildlife values.

       Findings and declaration of policy — Water to eastern North Dakota a critical priority — Water supplementation study — Employment of staff.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds that many areas and localities in eastern North Dakota do not enjoy safe drinking water. It is also found that other areas and localities in eastern North Dakota do not have sufficient quantities of water to ensure a dependable, long-term water supply. The legislative assembly further finds that supplementation of the water resources of eastern North Dakota from other available sources, including the Missouri River, may be the only alternative to provide eastern North Dakota with a dependable source of safe, good quality water and an adequate quantity of water.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further declared that effective development and utilization of the land and water resources of this state; the opportunity for greater economic security; the protection of health, property, enterprise, and the preservation of the benefits from the land and water resources of this state; and the promotion of the prosperity and general welfare of all of the people of North Dakota involve, necessitate, and require the exercise of the sovereign powers of the state and concern a public purpose. Therefore, in order to accomplish this public purpose, it is declared necessary that a means to supply and distribute water to the people of eastern North Dakota for all beneficial purposes must be developed. In furtherance of this public purpose, the supply and delivery of water to eastern North Dakota is established as a critical priority and the state water commission shall, in cooperation with the Garrison Diversion Conservancy District and the communities and rural water systems in eastern North Dakota, address this critical priority by developing a plan and estimate of the costs for supplementing the water resources of eastern North Dakota with water supplies from other available resources, including the Missouri River.
     </p>
     <p>
      The state water commission may employ full-time personnel and may employ such other personnel as are necessary for the administration of this section as appropriated funds permit. Notwithstanding section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-02s61-02-64.1" target="_self">61-02-64.1</a></cite>, funds disbursed from the contract fund or appropriated for purposes of administering this section may be used for salaries and expenses of persons employed pursuant to this section.

     <p>
      The commission may, when it deems such action to be in the best interests of the state, for good and valuable consideration, release easements granted to the state for the construction, operation, and maintenance of dams, along with access thereto, if such dams have not been constructed within ten years of the granting of the easement or if such dams are no longer useful. The commission may also assign such easements to a political subdivision if it determines the assignment would be in the best interests of the state. Any release or assignment shall be in the name of the state of North Dakota by the governor and attested by the secretary of state.

      The commission may guarantee evidences of indebtedness issued or other obligations undertaken by the owners of water projects eligible to receive municipal, rural, and industrial water supply funds pursuant to Pub. L. 99-294 [100 Stat. 418], or evidences of indebtedness issued or other obligations undertaken by a not-for-profit organization establishing a financing program for the owners of the water projects eligible to receive municipal, rural, and industrial water supply funds pursuant to Pub. L. 99-294 [100 Stat. 418] for the purpose of providing the owners with construction period financing. Construction period financing may include the cost of construction of works or projects, funding of debt service reserves and capitalized interest, and the payment of the costs of issuance. A commission guarantee of indebtedness or other obligations of an owner of a water project must be authorized by resolution of the commission and must be evidenced by a written agreement approved by the commission.

       The commission shall establish and maintain a reserve fund in which there must be deposited all moneys appropriated by the legislative assembly for the purpose of the fund, all proceeds of notes issued or guaranteed by the commission required to be deposited in the fund by terms of a contract or a resolution of the commission with respect to the proceeds of notes, any moneys or funds of the commission that it determines to deposit in the fund, any moneys made available to the commission for the purposes of the fund from any other source, and any contractual right to the receipt of moneys by the commission for the purpose of the fund, including a letter of credit or similar instrument. Moneys in the reserve fund must be held and applied solely to the payment of the interest on and the principal of notes and sinking fund payments as they become due and payable and for the retirement of notes, including payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when any notes are redeemed or retired before maturity, and for the payment of principal and interest on evidences of indebtedness or obligations guaranteed by the commission. Moneys in the reserve fund may not be withdrawn if the withdrawal would reduce the amount in the reserve fund to an amount less than the required debt service reserve, except for payment of the interest due and payable on notes and the principal of notes maturing and payable and sinking fund payments and for the retirement of notes in accordance with the terms of a contract between the commission and its noteholders, for the payment of principal and interest on evidences of indebtedness or obligations of an owner of water projects for which a guarantee has been issued by the commission, and for payment of interest or principal or sinking fund payments or retirement of notes or draws upon a guarantee, for which other moneys of the commission are not then available in accordance with the terms of the contract. The reserve fund may not be used for the payment of a guarantee by the commission unless the commission has determined that notes of the commission cannot be issued under acceptable terms for the payment of the guarantee or that the payment of the guarantee will not reduce the reserve fund to an amount less than the required debt service reserve. The required debt service reserve must be an aggregate amount equal to at least the largest amount of money required by the terms of all contracts between the commission and its noteholders to be raised in the current or any succeeding calendar year for the payment of interest on and maturing principal of outstanding notes and the payment required by the terms of any contract to a sinking fund established for the payment or redemption of the notes.

       If the establishment of the reserve fund for an issue or the maintenance of an existing reserve fund at a required level under this section would necessitate the investment of all or any portion of a new reserve fund or all or any portion of an existing reserve fund at a restricted yield, because to not restrict the yield may cause the notes to be taxable under the Internal Revenue Code, then at the discretion of the commission a reserve fund does not need be established before the issuance of notes or the reserve fund need not be funded to the levels required by other subsections of this section or an existing reserve fund may be reduced.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-02s61-02-68.16ol13">
       Notes may not be issued by the commission unless there is in the reserve fund the required debt service reserve for all notes then issued and outstanding and the notes to be issued. This chapter does not prevent or preclude the commission from satisfying this requirement by depositing so much of the proceeds of the notes to be issued, upon their issuance, as is needed to achieve the required debt service reserve. The commission may issue its notes for the purpose of providing an amount necessary to increase the amount in the reserve fund to the required debt service reserve, or to meet any higher or additional reserve as may be fixed by the commission with respect to the fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-02s61-02-68.16ol14">
       In order to assure the maintenance of the required debt service reserve, there must be appropriated by the legislative assembly and paid to the commission for deposit in the reserve fund any sum certified by the commission as necessary to restore the reserve fund to an amount equal to the required debt service reserve or to maintain a reserve fund established by the commission under this chapter and required according to the terms of a guarantee issued by the commission. The commission may approve a resolution for the issuance of notes, as provided by this chapter, which states in substance that this subsection is not applicable to the required debt service reserve for notes issued under that resolution.

      <li id="t61c61-02s61-02-68.16ol15">
       If the maturity of a series of notes of the commission is not more than three years from the date of issuance of the notes, the commission may determine that no reserve fund need be established for that respective series of notes or that the reserve fund may be in an amount less than the required debt service reserve. If the determination is made, holders of that respective series of notes do not have an interest in or claim on existing reserve funds established for the security of the holders of previously issued commission notes, and do not have an interest in or claim on reserve funds established for the holders of subsequent issues of notes of the commission.

       Development in breach inundation zones — No financial assistance for dam improvements.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a political subdivision permits building or development within a breach inundation zone and the building or development causes a change in a dam’s current hazard classification necessitating structural improvements or upgrades to the dam, the political subdivision shall pay for the necessary improvements or upgrades. State loans, grants, cost-share, and other financial assistance may not be provided to pay for the dam improvements or upgrades. For purposes of this section, “breach inundation zone” means the area downstream of the dam which would be flooded in the event of a dam failure or uncontrolled release of water.

The rules must be consistent with federal law. The state engineer may prohibit the specification of any defined area as a disposal site, withdraw any defined area from specification as a disposal site, or deny or restrict the use of any defined area for specification as a disposal site whenever the state engineer determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that the discharge of dredged or fill materials will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas.

Any general permit issued under this section must set forth the requirements and standards which apply to any activity authorized by the general permit. General permits must be issued pursuant to rules adopted by the state engineer which are consistent with federal law.

      <b>
       3.

      The state engineer may require an individual permit for any proposed activity under a general permit where the nature or location of the activity makes an individual permit more appropriate.

       SECTION 7. Emergency permits.
      </b>
      The state engineer may issue a temporary emergency permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material if unacceptable harm to life or severe loss of physical property is likely to occur before a permit could be issued or modified under procedures normally required.

       SECTION 8. Permit application — Notice — Hearing.
      </b>
      Any person desiring to discharge dredged or fill material for which a permit is required shall file an application with the state engineer. The application must be on a form prescribed by the state engineer and must include information required by the state engineer. The state engineer may issue a permit after notice and opportunity for public hearing. Within fifteen days of receipt of all the information required to complete an application for a permit, the state engineer shall publish the notice.

      The state engineer has the following powers:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.

     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 3. Permits — Certification from state department of health and consolidated laboratories required.
      </b>
      The state engineer may not issue a permit under this Act without a certification from the state department of health and consolidated laboratories that the permitted activity will not adversely affect water quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 4. Specification of disposal sites.
      </b>
      The state engineer shall specify a disposal site for each permit issued. Each disposal site must be specified for each permit through application of rules adopted by the state engineer. The rules must be consistent with federal law. The state engineer may prohibit the specification of any defined area as a disposal site, withdraw any defined area from specification as a disposal site, or deny or restrict the use of any defined area for specification as a disposal site whenever the state engineer determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, that the discharge of dredged or fill materials will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or recreational areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 5. Discharge of dredged or fill material — Permit required — Exceptions.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      Except as otherwise provided by this Act, no person may discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the state unless that person has a permit from the state engineer. No person may discharge dredged or fill material in violation of a permit. A permit is not required for:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      Any discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the state incidental to any of the activities identified in subdivisions a through g of subsection 1 must have a permit if it is part of an activity whose purpose is to convert an area of waters of the state into a use to which it was not previously subject, where the flow or circulation of waters of the state may be impaired or the reach of such waters reduced, or if the discharge contains a toxic pollutant. Where the proposed discharge will result in significant discernible alterations to flow or circulation, the presumption is that flow or circulation may be impaired by such alteration.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 6. General permits.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      In carrying out the functions relating to the discharge or dredged or fill material, the state engineer may, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, issue general permits on a state or regional basis for any category of activities involving discharges of dredged or fill material if the state engineer determines that the activities in the category are similar in nature, will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately, and will have only minimal accumulative adverse effects on the environment. Any general permit issued under this section must set forth the requirements and standards which apply to any activity authorized by the general permit. General permits must be issued pursuant to rules adopted by the state engineer which are consistent with federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      A general permit may be revoked or modified by the state engineer if, after opportunity for public hearing, the state engineer determines that the activities authorized by the general permit have an adverse impact on the environment or such activities are more appropriately authorized by individual permits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      The state engineer may require an individual permit for any proposed activity under a general permit where the nature or location of the activity makes an individual permit more appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 7. Emergency permits.
      </b>
      The state engineer may issue a temporary emergency permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material if unacceptable harm to life or severe loss of physical property is likely to occur before a permit could be issued or modified under procedures normally required.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 8. Permit application — Notice — Hearing.
      </b>
      Any person desiring to discharge dredged or fill material for which a permit is required shall file an application with the state engineer. The application must be on a form prescribed by the state engineer and must include information required by the state engineer. The state engineer may issue a permit after notice and opportunity for public hearing. Within fifteen days of receipt of all the information required to complete an application for a permit, the state engineer shall publish the notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 9. Proceedings.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      Any proceeding to determine compliance or violation of the provisions of this chapter, or any rule, order, or condition in a permit issued pursuant to this chapter by the state engineer must be conducted in accordance with chapter 28-32.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      Any person claiming to be aggrieved or adversely affected by actions taken or by any rule or order issued pursuant to this chapter may request a hearing by the state engineer if no hearing on the matter resulting in the action has been held. If a hearing has been held, the person claiming to be aggrieved or adversely affected may petition for reconsideration and may appeal in accordance with chapter 28-32.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 10. Penalties.
      </b>
      The state engineer may assess or sue to recover civil penalties and seek criminal remedies as provided in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.

      <b>
       2.

      <b>
       SECTION 11. Restoration.
      </b>
      In lieu of or in addition to the penalties authorized under section 10 of this Act, the state engineer may require restoration of areas in which dredged or fill material has been illegally discharged. If the state engineer determines that any person has discharged dredged or fill material without a permit or in violation of any permit condition, the state engineer shall notify the person by registered or certified mail. The notice must specify the nature and extent of noncompliance and state that the area in which the dredged or fill material is located must be restored to the satisfaction of the state engineer within thirty days of receipt of the notice. If the area is not restored as required, the state engineer shall cause the restoration of the area and assess the cost of the restoration against the person or persons responsible for the illegal discharge.

       2.
      </b>
      Any discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the state incidental to any of the activities identified in subdivisions a through g of subsection 1 must have a permit if it is part of an activity whose purpose is to convert an area of waters of the state into a use to which it was not previously subject, where the flow or circulation of waters of the state may be impaired or the reach of such waters reduced, or if the discharge contains a toxic pollutant. Where the proposed discharge will result in significant discernible alterations to flow or circulation, the presumption is that flow or circulation may be impaired by such alteration.

       SECTION 6. General permits.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      In carrying out the functions relating to the discharge or dredged or fill material, the state engineer may, after notice and opportunity for public hearing, issue general permits on a state or regional basis for any category of activities involving discharges of dredged or fill material if the state engineer determines that the activities in the category are similar in nature, will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately, and will have only minimal accumulative adverse effects on the environment. Any general permit issued under this section must set forth the requirements and standards which apply to any activity authorized by the general permit. General permits must be issued pursuant to rules adopted by the state engineer which are consistent with federal law.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      A general permit may be revoked or modified by the state engineer if, after opportunity for public hearing, the state engineer determines that the activities authorized by the general permit have an adverse impact on the environment or such activities are more appropriately authorized by individual permits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      The state engineer may require an individual permit for any proposed activity under a general permit where the nature or location of the activity makes an individual permit more appropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 7. Emergency permits.
      </b>
      The state engineer may issue a temporary emergency permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material if unacceptable harm to life or severe loss of physical property is likely to occur before a permit could be issued or modified under procedures normally required.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 8. Permit application — Notice — Hearing.
      </b>
      Any person desiring to discharge dredged or fill material for which a permit is required shall file an application with the state engineer. The application must be on a form prescribed by the state engineer and must include information required by the state engineer. The state engineer may issue a permit after notice and opportunity for public hearing. Within fifteen days of receipt of all the information required to complete an application for a permit, the state engineer shall publish the notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 9. Proceedings.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      Any proceeding to determine compliance or violation of the provisions of this chapter, or any rule, order, or condition in a permit issued pursuant to this chapter by the state engineer must be conducted in accordance with chapter 28-32.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      Any person claiming to be aggrieved or adversely affected by actions taken or by any rule or order issued pursuant to this chapter may request a hearing by the state engineer if no hearing on the matter resulting in the action has been held. If a hearing has been held, the person claiming to be aggrieved or adversely affected may petition for reconsideration and may appeal in accordance with chapter 28-32.

       SECTION 10. Penalties.
      </b>
      The state engineer may assess or sue to recover civil penalties and seek criminal remedies as provided in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       1.
      </b>
      The state engineer may assess or recover civil penalties for discharges of dredged or fill material without a required permit or in violation of any permit condition of up to five thousand dollars per day of such violation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       2.
      </b>
      The state engineer may seek criminal fines against any person who willfully or with criminal negligence discharges dredged or fill material without a required permit or violates any permit condition issued under this chapter of up to ten thousand dollars per day of such violation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       3.
      </b>
      The state engineer may seek criminal fines against any person who knowingly makes a false statement, representation, or certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be maintained under this chapter or any rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, or falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required to be maintained under the permit of up to five thousand dollars for each instance of violation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 11. Restoration.
      </b>
      In lieu of or in addition to the penalties authorized under section 10 of this Act, the state engineer may require restoration of areas in which dredged or fill material has been illegally discharged. If the state engineer determines that any person has discharged dredged or fill material without a permit or in violation of any permit condition, the state engineer shall notify the person by registered or certified mail. The notice must specify the nature and extent of noncompliance and state that the area in which the dredged or fill material is located must be restored to the satisfaction of the state engineer within thirty days of receipt of the notice. If the area is not restored as required, the state engineer shall cause the restoration of the area and assess the cost of the restoration against the person or persons responsible for the illegal discharge.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       SECTION 12. Effective date.
      </b>
      This Act becomes effective on the date the state engineer certifies to the governor and the secretary of state that the state has received adequate funds from the federal government or other sources to fund the program established pursuant to this Act, as determined by the state engineer and approved by the legislative assembly. The secretary of state shall forward a copy of the state engineer’s certification to the legislative council, with a notation indicating the effective date of this Act.”

       Plans of operation for reservoirs — Adequate structure.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every operator of a water storage reservoir in North Dakota having a capacity of more than one thousand acre-feet [1233481.84 cubic meters] annually shall file with the department, between the first and fifteenth day of February, an operating plan for the reservoir for the calendar year in which the plan is filed. The operator of the reservoir shall cooperate with the department to make all water releases compatible with the best interest of the greatest number of downstream water users and affected landowners. If the department declares an emergency in connection with the operation of the reservoir, the operator promptly shall submit to the department a separate interim operating plan for the reservoir. The interim operating plan must be coordinated and integrated with the suggestions and plans of the department to serve the affected persons during the emergency. The department may require reservoir operators to maintain adequate structures and operate them in a manner to prevent waste, promote the beneficial use of water, and not endanger the general health and welfare of persons affected by the reservoirs. If an operator fails to maintain and operate adequate structures, the department shall set a place and time for hearing and serve notice upon the operator to show cause why the operator’s water permit should not be canceled. A copy of any order canceling the water right must be filed in the office of the recorder in the county or counties where the land to which the right is appurtenant is located. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the department in accordance with chapter 28-32.

     <p>
      If the department determines works are unsafe or unauthorized, the department shall notify the landowners by registered mail at the landowner’s last-known post-office address of record. A copy of the notice also must be sent to any tenant, if the department has actual knowledge of the fact that a tenant exists. The notice must specify the nature and extent of the noncompliance and the modifications necessary for compliance, and must state if the works are not modified or removed within the period stated in the notice, but not less than thirty days, the department shall cause the removal or modification of the works and assess the cost of the removal or modification, or a portion of the cost as the department determines, against the property of the landowner responsible. The notice also must state the affected landowner may demand in writing a hearing on the matter within fifteen days of the date the notice is mailed. The request for a hearing must state with particularity the issues, facts, and points of law to be presented at the hearing. If the department determines the issues, facts, and law to be presented are well-founded and not frivolous, and the request for a hearing was not made merely to interpose delay, the department shall set a hearing date without undue delay. In an emergency, the department immediately may apply to the appropriate district court for an injunction prohibiting the landowner or tenant from constructing or maintaining the works, or ordering the landowner to remove or modify the works. Any assessments levied under this section must be collected in the same manner as other assessments authorized by this title. If, in the opinion of the director, more than one landowner or tenant has been responsible, the costs may be assessed on a pro rata basis in proportion to the responsibility of the landowners. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the department under this section may appeal the decision to the district court of the county in which the land is located in accordance with chapter 28-32. A hearing under this section is a prerequisite to an appeal unless the hearing was denied by the department.

      For purposes of this section, the term “works” includes dams, dikes, wells, or other devices for water conservation, flood control, regulation, storage, diversion, or carriage of water.

If a building, structure, boat dock, debris, or other manmade object, except a fence or corral, is partially or completely submerged due to the expansion of navigable waters, the person responsible is the person who owns or had control of the property on which the object is located or the person who owned or had control of the property immediately before it became submerged by water.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person, before commencing any construction for the purpose of appropriating waters of the state or before taking waters of the state from any constructed works, shall first secure a water permit from the department of water resources unless the construction or taking from the constructed works is for domestic or livestock purposes or for fish, wildlife, and other recreational uses or unless otherwise provided by law. However, immediately upon completing any constructed works for domestic or livestock purposes or for fish, wildlife, and other recreational uses, the water user shall notify the department of water resources of the location and acre-feet [1233.48 cubic meters] capacity of the constructed works, dams, or dugouts. Regardless of proposed use, all water users, except those reusing fossil byproduct water, shall secure a water permit prior to constructing an impoundment capable of retaining more than twelve and one-half acre-feet [15418.52 cubic meters] of water or the construction of a well from which more than twelve and one-half acre-feet [15418.52 cubic meters] of water per year will be appropriated. If a permit is not required of a landowner or the landowner’s lessee to appropriate less than twelve and one-half acre-feet [15418.52 cubic meters] of water from any source for domestic or livestock purposes or for fish, wildlife, and other recreational uses, those appropriators may apply for water permits to clearly establish a priority date, and the department of water resources may waive any fee or hearing for the applications. An applicant for a water permit to irrigate need not be the owner of the land to be irrigated.

   Under this section, any “constructed works” for the appropriation of water requires a permit from the state engineer unless, both, it is for “domestic or livestock purposes or for fish, wildlife and other recreational uses,” and it is not “capable of retaining more than twelve and one-half acre-feet”. Any dam for any purpose which is “capable of retaining more than twelve and one-half acre-feet” requires authorization. North Dakota State Eng'r v. Schirado, 373 N.W.2d 904, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 395</cite> (N.D. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>

   State engineer had statutory authority to regulate the size and safety of defendant’s dam to the extent that it was capable of retaining more than twelve and one-half acre-feet of water. However, as it had not been shown that complete removal of the dam was required, judgment ordering the removal of the dam would be vacated and remanded for formulation of a proper judgment to enforce the state engineer’s statutory regulatory authority. North Dakota State Eng'r v. Schirado, 373 N.W.2d 904, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 395</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   Because an unauthorized dam and slough on an owner’s land impounded sufficient water to require permits under N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-04s61-04-02" target="_self">61-04-02</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-38" target="_self">61-16.1-38</a></cite>, and because no permits had been procured, the state engineer had authority under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-03s61-03-21.2" target="_self">61-03-21.2</a></cite> to order the owner to modify the unauthorized dam and to construct a ditch to drain the slough to 1543.5 feet mean sea level.

      The department of water resources may issue a conditional water permit for less than the amount of water requested. Except for water permits for incorporated municipalities or rural water systems, the department may not issue a permit for more water than can be beneficially used for the purposes stated in the application. Water permits for incorporated municipalities or rural water systems may contain water in excess of present needs based upon what may reasonably be necessary for the future water requirements of the municipality or the rural water system. The department may require modification of the plans and specifications for the appropriation. The department may issue a permit subject to fees for water use and conditions the department considers necessary to protect the rights of others and the public interest. The fees must be used by the department for planning, research, and administration required to regulate the allocation and appropriation of the waters of the state. Conditions must be related to matters within the department’s jurisdiction. Fees collected under this section must be deposited in the resources trust fund of the state treasury. All conditions attached to any permit issued before July 1, 1975, are binding upon the permitholder.

       Priority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Priority in time gives the superior water right. Priority of a water right acquired under this chapter dates from the filing of an application with the department of water resources, except for water applied to domestic or livestock purposes, or fish, wildlife, and other recreational uses in which case the priority date must relate back to the date when the quantity of water in question was first appropriated, unless otherwise provided by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Priority of appropriation does not include the right to prevent changes in the condition of water occurrence, such as the increase or decrease of streamflow, or the lowering of a water table, artesian pressure, or water level, by later appropriators, if the prior appropriator can acquire reasonably the prior appropriator’s water under the changed conditions.

     <p>
      After the permit’s beneficial use date, or upon notice from the permitholder that water has been applied to a beneficial use, the department of water resources shall notify the conditional water permitholder and inspect the works. The inspection must determine the safety, efficiency, and actual capacity of the works. If the works are not constructed properly and safely, the department may require the necessary changes to be made within a reasonable time. Failure to make the changes within the time prescribed by the department will result in postponement of the permit’s priority date to the date the changes are made to the satisfaction of the department. Any intervening application submitted before the date the changes are made will have the benefit of the postponement of priority. When the works are constructed properly and safely and inspected, the department shall issue the perfected water permit, setting forth the actual capacity of the works and the limitations or conditions upon the water permit as stated in the conditional water permit authorized by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-04s61-04-06.2" target="_self">61-04-06.2</a></cite>. All conditions attached to any permit issued before July 1, 1975, are binding upon the permitholder.

     <p>
      If the department of water resources, in the course of the department’s duties, finds any works used for the storage, diversion, or carriage of water are unsafe and a menace to life or property, the department shall notify the owner or the owner’s agent, specifying the changes necessary and allowing a reasonable time for putting the works in safe condition. Upon the request of any party, accompanied by the estimated cost of inspection, the department shall inspect any alleged unsafe works. If the works are found unsafe by the department, the money deposited by the party must be refunded, and the fees for inspection must be paid by the owner of the works. If the owner of the works does not pay the fees within thirty days after the decision of the department, the fees must be a lien against any property of the owner, and the state’s attorney of the county shall initiate a suit to recover the fees from the owner at the request of the department. The department may inspect any works under construction for the storage, diversion, or carriage of water and may require any changes necessary to secure the safety of the works. The fees for the inspection must be a lien on any property of the owner and must be subject to collection as provided in this chapter but neither the United States nor the state of North Dakota nor any government agency may be required to pay such fees.

   State engineer had statutory authority to regulate the size and safety of defendant’s dam to the extent that it was capable of retaining more than twelve and one-half acre-feet of water. However, as it had not been shown that complete removal of the dam was required, judgment ordering the removal of the dam would be vacated and remanded for formulation of a proper judgment to enforce the state engineer’s statutory regulatory authority.

      Any appropriation of water must be for a beneficial use, and when the appropriator fails to apply it to the beneficial use cited in the permit or ceases to use it for the beneficial use cited in the permit for three successive years, unless the failure or cessation of use has been due to the unavailability of water, a justifiable inability to complete the works, or other good and sufficient cause, the department of water resources may cancel the water permit or right. For purposes of this chapter, an incorporated municipality or rural water system has good and sufficient cause excusing the failure to use a water permit, if the water permit reasonably may be necessary for the future water requirements of the municipality or the rural water system. The department of water resources, as often as necessary, shall examine the condition of all works constructed or partially constructed within the state and compile information concerning the condition of every water permit or right and all ditches and other works constructed or partially constructed under the permit or right.

       Cancellation of water rights — Hearing — Appeal.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      At the hearing the recommended decision of the department of water resources is prima facie evidence for cancellation of the water permit or portion of the permit. If no one appears at the hearing, the water permit or portion must be canceled. If interested parties appear and contest the cancellation, the department shall hear the evidence and, if it appears the water has not been put to a beneficial use, or, having been put to a beneficial use at one time, has ceased to be used for the purpose for more than three successive years, unless the failure or cessation of use is due to the unavailability of water, a justifiable inability to complete the works, or other good and sufficient cause, the permit, or a portion of the permit, must be canceled. For purposes of this chapter, an incorporated municipality or a rural water system has good and sufficient cause excusing the failure to use a water permit, if the water permit reasonably may be necessary for the future water requirements of the municipality or the rural water system. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the department in accordance with chapter 28-32.

     <p>
      In order that the state may share to the fullest extent in the benefits already gained through fundamental research and investigation on new and improved means for predicting, influencing, and controlling the weather, for the best interest, general welfare, health, and safety of all the people of the state, and to provide proper safeguards in applying the measures for use in connection therewith in order to protect life and property, it is deemed necessary and hereby declared that the state of North Dakota claims its sovereign right to use the moisture contained in the clouds and atmosphere within the state boundaries. All water derived as a result of weather modification operations shall be considered a part of North Dakota’s basic water supply and all statutes, rules, and regulations applying to natural precipitation shall also apply to precipitation resulting from cloud seeding.

      The legislative assembly finds that weather modification affects the public health, safety, and welfare, and that, properly conducted, weather modification operations can improve water quality and quantity, reduce losses from weather hazards, and provide economic benefits for the people of the state. Therefore, in the public interest, weather modification shall be subject to regulation and control, and research and development shall be encouraged. To minimize possible adverse effects, weather modification operations shall be carried on with proper safeguards, and accurate information shall be recorded concerning such operations and the benefits obtained therefrom by the people of the state.

       Temporary weather modification authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The board of county commissioners of any county that has no weather modification authority may create a temporary weather modification authority by setting a time and place for a public hearing, publishing at least ten days before the hearing notice of the hearing in the official newspaper of the county, and after the public hearing, approving establishment of the authority by majority vote. Upon approval, the board of county commissioners shall designate a water resource district to serve as the temporary weather modification authority. The designated district has all the powers granted to a weather modification authority under sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-04.1s61-04.1-23" target="_self">61-04.1-23</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-04.1s61-04.1-32" target="_self">61-04.1-32</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      A temporary weather modification authority created under this section may conduct weather modification operations within the county for up to four years from the date of the creation of the temporary authority. To continue operating beyond the four-year period, the temporary authority must be made permanent in accordance with sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-04.1s61-04.1-23" target="_self">61-04.1-23</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-04.1s61-04.1-32" target="_self">61-04.1-32</a></cite>.

       Weather modification authority created by petition.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A weather modification authority shall be created by resolution and five commissioners appointed thereto for ten-year terms of office, by the board of county commissioners. A board of county commissioners shall not adopt a resolution creating an authority until it has received a valid petition signed by at least fifty-one percent of the qualified electors of a county, as determined by the vote cast for the office of governor at the last preceding general election. The board of county commissioners shall appoint five residents of the county as weather modification authority commissioners from those names set forth in the petition and designated by the petitioners to be appointed weather modification authority commissioners. In the event any one of the five candidates named in the petition to be appointed weather modification authority commissioner is unable or refuses for any reason to accept appointment as commissioner, or is disqualified by not meeting residence requirements, as a qualified elector in the county, the board of county commissioners shall name its own appointee for a ten-year term of office in place of any disqualified candidate selected by the petitioners. If any weather modification authority commissioner submits a resignation in writing to the board of county commissioners or becomes unable or disqualified for any reason, after accepting office, the board of county commissioners shall name its appointee as a commissioner to the weather modification authority. All vacancies occurring otherwise than by expiration of term of office shall be filled for the unexpired term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any weather modification authority created pursuant to this section shall expire ten years after the date of the initial appointment of the commissioners thereto. Any unexpended funds remaining in the name of the weather modification authority, after all proper bills and expenses have been paid, shall be transferred into the county general fund by the officers of the weather modification authority on or before the ten-year termination date provided by this section. However, all unexpended funds remaining in the name of the weather modification authority, after all proper bills and expenses have been paid, shall remain in the name of the weather modification authority if the board of county commissioners of such county by resolution creates a weather modification authority and all its powers in accordance with section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-04.1s61-04.1-27" target="_self">61-04.1-27</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall prevent continuation or reinstatement of a weather modification authority, provided the authority is renewed for another ten years by petition of the qualified electors in the same manner as the initial weather modification authority was created by petition of qualified electors as provided for in this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event more than one petition is filed with the board of county commissioners on or about the same time, the petition with the highest percentage of the qualified electors of the county voting for the office of governor at the last preceding general election shall be selected by the board of county commissioners. However, the petition with the highest percentage must have the signatures of at least forty percent of the qualified electors in the county and the sum total of all qualified electors signing all petitions filed must equal at least sixty percent of the qualified electors in the county. In no case shall the name of the same qualified elector appear on two or more petitions, but in such event, the name shall be stricken from both petitions.

To effect an appeal an undertaking must be executed by the appellant and sufficient surety conditioned that the appellant will prosecute the appeal without delay and will pay all costs adjudged against the appellant in the district court. The undertaking must be made in favor of the department of water resources as obligee and may be enforced by the department. The appeal must be taken to the district court of the county in which the land claimed to be affected adversely by the order or decision appealed from is situated.

The district court has and shall exercise original jurisdiction in the appeal and shall hear and rule on the case, without a jury, in the same manner as a civil cause originally commenced in that court. The court may require and fix the time for the service and filing of formal pleadings. Appeals to the supreme court may be taken by the department of water resources or any other party to the cause from any judgment entered in the district court and from any order of the court if an appeal would lie from the order if the order were entered by the court in any other civil action.

      If an irrigation district contains twenty thousand irrigable acres [8093.72 irrigable hectares] or more and is divided into seven divisions or precincts, the board of directors of the irrigation district consists of seven directors. Three directors elected at the election for the organization of the district serve until the first Tuesday in April following the first regular district election, and four directors serve until the first Tuesday in April following the second regular district election.
     </p>
     <p>
      The terms of office of the directors elected at the first election for the organization of the district must be determined by lot at their first meeting. Directors elected at subsequent elections serve for four years and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. In case the office of any director becomes vacant, the remaining members of the board shall fill the vacancy by appointment. A director appointed to fill a vacancy serves the unexpired term of the director whose office that director has been appointed to fill. If vacancies occur in the offices of a majority of the directors of an irrigation district, the remaining members and the director of the department of water resources shall fill the vacancies; and if the offices of all the directors become vacant, the director of the department of water resources shall appoint the members of the board who shall serve until the next regular election of the district. The successors of the appointed directors must be elected to serve the unexpired term of the directors whose offices became vacant. The unexpired term of office that each director elected in this manner fills must be determined by lot.

Every company whose railroad or utility shall be intersected or crossed by such works shall unite with the board in forming such intersections and crossings, and shall grant the privilege aforesaid. If the board cannot agree with such railroad company, or with the owners and controllers of the property, thing, or franchise to be crossed, upon the amount to be paid on account of such crossing or the point at which or the manner in which the crossing shall be made, the same shall be ascertained and determined in all respects as is provided for the taking of land. The right of way is given, dedicated, and set apart, to locate, construct, and maintain such works over and through any of the lands which are or may be the property of the state.

       Procuring water supply from district outside of state — Validity and legality.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When any irrigation district shall find it necessary to procure its supply of water for the irrigation of the lands within the district from outside the boundaries of this state, such district may enter into an agreement or contract with any state board, commission, or bureau, or with any person, association, company, corporation, limited liability company, or irrigation district, having the control and jurisdiction over the water of such other state, for water rights therein or for supplying the district with water sufficient for its irrigation needs. The making of such contract and the issuance of bonds or improvement warrants and the levying of assessments, or other method agreed upon for the payment of rights, franchises, or water charges to obtain the required supply of water shall be deemed valid, and of full force and effect, and shall have the same validity and legality as though the same rights and franchises existed wholly within this state.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An appeal may be taken to the district court from any order or decision of the board of an irrigation district, by any person who is aggrieved thereby. The appeal must be taken in accordance with the procedure provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-34s28-34-01" target="_blank">28-34-01</a></cite>. To effect an appeal, an undertaking must be executed by the appellant and sufficient surety conditioned that the appellant will prosecute such appeal without delay and will pay all costs adjudged against the appellant in the district court. The undertaking must be made in favor of the irrigation district as the obligee and may be enforced by the district. The appeal must be taken to the district court of the county in which the land claimed to be affected adversely by the order or decision appealed from is situated, and if the land is situated in more than one county, the appeal may be taken to the district court of any county in which any part of the land is situated. Any appeal thus taken must be docketed in the district court as any civil cause commenced in the district court is docketed and must be heard and determined without a jury. Appeals to the supreme court may be taken by the irrigation district or any other party to the cause from any judgment entered in the district court in any such cause and from any order of said court if an appeal would lie from such an order if the same were entered by the court in any other civil action.

       District assessor to examine tracts of land to fix annual assessments levied thereon.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Between the first Monday in March and the first Monday in June of each year, the district assessor shall examine each tract of land or legal subdivision of land in the district, including entered and unentered public lands of the United States, subject to entry under any act of Congress, and all other lands publicly or privately owned. In determining irrigation or drainage benefits, the district assessor shall first ascertain the number of irrigable or drained acres [hectares] within each tract or subdivision, as determined by the board of directors, and this must form the primary basis for determining the benefits accruing due to construction, acquisition, or operation of irrigation or drainage works. In addition, the district assessor shall include such factors as methods of irrigation, power consumption, water conservation, and whether or not irrigable acres [hectares] are actually being irrigated. The amount of benefits apportioned or distributed to each tract of land as determined and equalized must be the basis for fixing the annual assessments levied during that year against the tracts or subdivisions in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.

     <p>
      The assessor shall make, or cause to be made, a list showing the apportionment or distribution of assessments with a description of each unit or tract of land assessed in the district and the name of the record owner of each unit or tract. Alternatively, the assessor may prepare a map on a convenient scale showing each unit or tract of land with the amount per acre [.40 hectare] apportioned to the unit or tract. Where practicable, the units of land must consist of governmental subdivisions of forty acres [16.19 hectares] or more. If all lands on the statement or map are assessed at the same amount or rate per acre [.40 hectare], a general statement to that effect is sufficient. A copy of the list or map must be filed in the office of the county auditor of each county in which the district is situated, and another copy must be filed in the department of water resources. One copy must remain in the office of the board for public inspection.

     <p>
      Whenever any assessment is made within an irrigation district it must be apportioned to and spread upon each unit or tract of land in the district in proportion to the benefits received, as determined by the assessor in accordance with section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-09s61-09-01" target="_self">61-09-01</a></cite>. Bonds, district improvement warrants, and other obligations incurred by the district must be the obligations of the district. Only lands within the district benefited by irrigation or drainage provided by the district and subject to assessment for irrigation or drainage benefits are subject to assessment for any fund created for the payment of bonds, district improvement warrants, and other district obligations. All assessments approved and levied by an irrigation district for any fund or purpose under the authority of this title must be in the form of special assessments and levied against both privately and publicly owned lands.

       Board may borrow additional funds if levy of annual assessment is insufficient for district — Limitations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If after the levy of the annual assessment for the current year, the board finds that because of some unusual or unforeseen cause funds raised through the collection of the assessment, and from other sources, will not be sufficient for the proper maintenance and operation of the district, and the irrigation works of the district, the board may borrow additional funds needed to an amount not to exceed twenty dollars per acre [.40 hectare] for the irrigable lands within the district and may pledge the credit of the district for the payment of the loan, or the board may issue bonds in anticipation of further collections. The board shall include in the levy for the ensuing year the amount required to pay the loan or to retire the bonds.

     <p>
      An irrigation district, on account of expenses of operation and maintenance and to pay the current expenses of the district, in any year may not borrow in excess of ninety percent of the levy of assessments for that year. In case of due and outstanding obligations of the district on account of current expenses and expenses of operation and maintenance contracted before the year in which the levy is made, the district board may make an additional levy, not to exceed twenty dollars per acre [.40 hectare], upon all irrigable lands within the district, to create a special fund for the payment of the past-due obligations. Whenever the claims or obligations against any fund for any year are fully paid, the board may transfer any unused balance to any fund for any preceding or succeeding year.

       Assessment made to be general tax — When due and delinquent — Tax lien to be preferred lien.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All assessments made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter on real property, and assessments on leasehold estates owned by this state or any of its subdivisions, and, to the extent provided by the Act of Congress of August 11, 1916, assessments on entered or unentered public lands shall be a general tax against the real property on which assessed in like manner and to the same effect as general state and county taxes and shall be of the same order. The lien thereof shall share ratably with general tax liens in all tax proceedings and tax lien foreclosures and shall be subject to all provisions of law relating to general taxes. Such assessment shall become due and payable and delinquent at the same time as other general state and county taxes lien foreclosure and shall remain subject to all statutory provisions applying to tax lien foreclosure. In case leasehold estates only are affected by said assessments, the tax lien foreclosure notice shall state that fact. The lien for the bonds of any series shall be preferred to that of any subsequent series, and the lien for the payments due to the United States under any contract between the district and the United States, accompanying which bonds have not been deposited with the United States, shall be a lien preferred over that of any issue of bonds or any series of any issue subsequent to the date of such contract. All funds arising from assessment and levy, if any, shall be devoted to the obligations of the district payable from said funds and as to all obligations from the bond and United States contract a fund shall be so devoted in the order of priority of the creation of the obligation. No error or omission which may be made in the proceedings of the board, or of any officer of an irrigation district in referring, reporting upon, ordering or otherwise acting concerning the establishment, construction, or acquisition of irrigation works, or concerning the issuance of bonds or improvement warrants, or in making or certifying any assessment shall vitiate or in any way affect any such assessment; but if it shall appear that by reason of such error or omission substantial injury has been done to the party or parties claiming to be aggrieved, the court shall alter such assessment as may be just and the same shall then be enforced. Whenever the validity of any assessment, or the validity of any deed given pursuant to a foreclosure of tax lien for such assessment shall be drawn in question in any action in any district court in this state, and such assessment shall be held to be invalid by reason of noncompliance with the laws of this state, the court shall determine the true and just amount which the property attempted to be so assessed by said assessment should pay, to make the same uniform with other assessments for the same purpose, and the amount of such assessments as the same appears on the assessment list thereof, shall be prima facie evidence of such true and just amount, and judgment must be rendered and given therefor against the property liable for such assessment, without regard to the proceedings had for the levy thereof, and such judgment shall be a lien upon the property upon which the assessment shall have been levied, of equal force and effect as the lien of irrigation district assessments, and the lien of such judgment shall be enforced by the court in such action.

     <p>
      The board of county commissioners, with the approval of the tax commissioner, may abate any assessments made by irrigation districts if application therefor is approved by the board of the irrigation district. In case such assessments are made for the purpose of meeting payments due to the United States or any department or agency thereof or to the state water commission, the application shall not be granted unless it also bears the approval of an authorized representative or agent of the United States or of such department or agency, or of the state water commission, as the case may be. In case bonds or improvement warrants are deposited with a trustee under a trust agreement or trust indenture, the consent of such trustee shall be obtained before abating any assessment for such bonds or improvement warrants. The application for the abatement may be made by the board of the irrigation district instead of by individual taxpayers and any number of tracts of land may be included in a single application.

       Petition for inclusion of land in district — Contents of petition.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The holder or holders of title, or evidence of title, and the secretary of the interior of the United States for unentered or public land, representing one-half or more of any body of lands which can be served by the irrigation system, and which, taken together, constitute one tract of land, may file with the board of directors of such district a petition in writing praying that the boundaries of such district may be so changed as to include their lands. The petition shall describe the boundaries of the parcel or tract of land, and also shall describe the boundaries of the several parcels owned by the petitioners, if they are the owners of district parcels. Such description need not be more particular than may be required when such lands are entered by the township assessor in the assessment book. Such petition must contain the assent of the petitioners to the inclusion in said district of the parcels or tracts of land described in the petition, and of which the petition alleges that they respectively are the owners, and it must be acknowledged in the manner in which a conveyance of lands is required to be acknowledged.

When lands are included in a district, the order of the board of directors allowing inclusion must be filed with the department of water resources and with the county auditor of each county in which the lands are situated. The order also must be filed and recorded in the office of the recorder of each such county.

       Measuring devices — Unlawful to take water without using.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every ditch owner shall construct and maintain a substantial headgate at the point where the water is diverted and shall construct a measuring device, of a design approved by the department of water resources, at the most practicable point for measuring and apportioning the water as determined by the department. The department may order the construction of the measuring device by the ditch owner, and if construction is not completed within twenty days after receipt of the order, the person in charge of the irrigation works, upon instructions from the department, shall refuse to deliver water to the ditch owner. The ditch owner may not take water from the irrigation works until the measuring device is constructed and the department approves the device. Measuring devices must be arranged so they can be locked in place, and when locked by the person in charge of the irrigation works or that person’s authorized agent, for the measurement or apportionment of water, other persons may not interfere with, disturb, or change the devices. The use of water through a measuring device that was interfered with, disturbed, or changed constitutes prima facie evidence the person benefited by the interference, disturbance, or change violated this section.

       The state water commission shall fix a time and place for a public hearing on a petition filed under this section at a site convenient and accessible for a majority of the affected individuals. At least fifteen days prior to the date of hearing, the commission shall publish notice of the hearing in at least one newspaper of general circulation in each of the districts being consolidated or adjusted. Additional notice of the hearing may be given in a manner prescribed by the state water commission.

       Prior to the hearing, the department of water resources shall make, or cause to be made, an investigation of the need for consolidation of the petitioning districts and shall submit a report of the findings to the state water commission. This report must be presented at the petition hearing. If the state water commission finds it is not feasible, desirable, or practical to consolidate the petitioning districts, the commission shall deny the petition and state the reasons for denial. If the state water commission finds problems of flood control, watershed development or improvement, drainage, water supply, or other reasons make consolidation or boundary adjustment and establishment of the proposed water resource district desirable, the commission shall grant the petition and create the district. Upon creation of the new water resource district, the state water commission shall dissolve the included districts or make necessary boundary adjustments to existing districts.

      When the petition is filed by the district boards, it must be accompanied by a certified copy of the resolution of the governing boards authorizing the signing of the petition. The petition must contain a detailed plan for the disposition of the property, assets, and liabilities of each of the districts. This plan must be as equitable as practicable to every landowner within the districts and must fully protect creditors and the holders of improvement warrants of the petitioning districts. The plan may provide for a continuance of assessments upon properties in the petitioning districts to retire outstanding obligations, or for the assumption of outstanding obligations and the spreading of assessments for the payment of the outstanding obligations over properties in the newly created district. The state water commission may not approve the petition unless the petition fully meets the requirements of this section.

      When a water resource district has been created, and the state water commission has filed notice with the county auditor of a county where the district or a part thereof is situated, a water resource board shall be appointed within ninety days, as provided herein. If the district’s boundaries are confined to one county, the board of county commissioners shall appoint a water resource board consisting of three or five managers. When a district includes two counties, the water resource board shall consist of five managers, three appointed by the board of county commissioners of the county having the larger aggregate taxable valuation of property, and two appointed by the board of county commissioners of the other county. If a district includes three counties, the water resource board shall consist of five managers, one appointed by the board of county commissioners having the lowest aggregate taxable valuation of property in the district, and two appointed by the board of county commissioners of each of the other two counties. If a district includes four or six counties, the water resource board shall consist of two members from the county having the largest aggregate taxable valuation of property in the district, and one manager from each of the other counties. If a district includes five or seven counties, the water resource board shall consist of one manager from each county. Appointments to the water resource board shall be made by the boards of county commissioners of the respective counties.

        Decision Not Nullified Due to Conflict.

   North Dakota Legislature did not envision nullification of a proceeding where a disqualified board member casts a non-determinative vote; therefore, a decision of a water resource board was not nullified due to a vote by members owning land in a watershed district because the votes were not determinative of the outcome.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly of North Dakota recognizes and declares that the general welfare and the protection of the lives, health, property, and the rights of all people of this state require that the management, conservation, protection, development, and control of waters in this state, navigable or non-navigable, surface or subsurface, the control of floods, the prevention of damage to property therefrom, involve and necessitate the exercise of the sovereign powers of this state and are affected with and concern a public purpose. To realize these objectives it is hereby declared to be the policy of the state to provide for the management, conservation, protection, development, and control of water resources and for the prevention of flood damage in the watersheds of this state and thereby to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of this state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly further recognizes the significant achievements that have been made in the management, conservation, protection, development, and control of our water and related land resources, and declares that the most efficient and economical method of accelerating these achievements is to establish water resource districts encompassing all of the geographic area of the state, and emphasizing hydrologic boundaries.

       District budget — Financial report — Tax levy — Financing by special assessment.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The fiscal year of the district begins January first and ends December thirty-first. The water resource board shall estimate the expenses of the district before October first of each year. Estimates of district expenses may include costs of rights of way, easements, or other interests in property deemed necessary for the construction, operation, and maintenance of any projects. The district budget may also include an amount necessary for future projects which are part of a master plan. In the year for which the levy is sought, a water resource board seeking approval of a property tax levy under this chapter must file with the county auditor of each county in the district, at a time and in a format prescribed by the county auditors, a financial report for the preceding calendar year showing the ending balances of each fund held by the water resource district during that year. Upon completion and adoption of a budget covering necessary expenses, the board shall send a copy of the budget to the county auditor of each county in the district. Each county auditor shall transmit the same to the board of county commissioners of that county. The board of county commissioners shall either disapprove the budget, amend and approve the budget as amended, or approve the budget as submitted and, if approved as amended or as submitted, the board shall, by resolution, levy and authorize and direct the county auditor to extend and spread upon the tax roll of the county or portion of the county in the district a tax not exceeding the limitation in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-15s57-15-26.6" target="_blank">57-15-26.6</a></cite> in the same manner, and with the same effect, as general property taxes are extended and spread. Funds produced each year by the tax levy shall be available until expended, and if the tax levy in any year will not produce sufficient revenue to cover district expenses, a fund sufficient to pay the district expenses may be accumulated. The acquisition of rights of way, easements, and the construction, operation, and maintenance of a project in a district may, in the discretion of the water resource board, be financed in whole or in part by special assessments against property benefited by such project, or from revenues realized from general tax collections, or from net revenues to be derived from service charges to be imposed and collected for the services of the project, or any combination of such sources.

     <p>
      After a district has been established and organized and a water resource board has been appointed, the water resource board, for the purpose of paying current district expenses, including per diem, compensation, and expenses of managers and wages or salaries of officers and employees, by resolution, may authorize and issue district warrants in anticipation of and pending collection and receipt of taxes levied. The warrants shall bear the rate of interest set by the board, which shall not exceed twelve percent per annum on those issues sold at private sale. There is no interest rate ceiling on warrants sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The district treasurer shall keep a register in which to enter each warrant issued, showing the date and amount of each warrant, the date of payment, and the amount paid in redemption thereof. All warrants shall be paid in order of their presentation for payment to the district treasurer. The warrants shall be drawn to the claimant or bearer in the same manner as a county warrant and shall be signed by the chairman of the water resource board and countersigned by the treasurer of the district. The aggregate total amount of warrants issued in any year to pay current district expenses shall not exceed eighty percent of the district’s tax levy for that year.

     <p>
      The treasurer of each county in which a district, or a part of a district, is situated shall collect all district taxes and special assessments together with any penalty and interest thereon in the same manner as county taxes are collected, and shall, within twenty days after the close of each month, pay to the treasurer of the district those taxes and assessments collected during the preceding month, and shall notify the secretary of the district of the payment. In June and December of each year, and as the county commission may otherwise require, the district treasurer shall report to each member of the water resource board the amount of money in the district treasury, the amount of receipts in the preceding month, and items and amounts of expenditures. At each regular meeting of the board the treasurer shall submit to the board a statement of the district’s finances.

     <p>
      Each district may invest any money in the district treasury, including money in any sinking fund established for the purpose of providing for the payment of the principal or interest of any contract, bond, or other indebtedness or for any other purpose, not required for the immediate needs of the district, in accordance with chapter 21-04.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds of the district shall be paid out or expended only upon the authorization or approval of the water resource board and by check, draft, warrant, or other instrument in writing, signed by the treasurer, assistant treasurer, or any other officer, employee, or agent of the district authorized by the treasurer to sign on behalf of the treasurer. The authorization shall be in writing and filed with the secretary of the district.

   Although this section allows a water resource board to advise a township on the installation of a culvert, the statute does not give the board any decision making authority to control the process.

       </p>
       <p>

   Water Resource Board did not have authority to order installation of a culvert under a township road in a natural watercourse because township boards have supervisory authority to decide whether to install a culvert beneath a township road to preserve a natural drainway for surface waters under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.24.html#t24c24-03s24-03-06" target="_blank">24-03-06</a></cite>.

       Water resource boards — Agreements with state or federal agencies for certain improvements.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A water resource board may enter into an agreement with any federal or state agency, or any combination thereof, for the construction of a project, under the terms of which the contract for the work is to be let by the federal or state agency or any combination thereof. If under the terms of the agreement at least fifty percent of the total cost of constructing the project is to be paid by the agency or agencies and if any portion of the cost of the project is to be paid by the levy of special assessments, the board may by resolution create a project assessment district for the purpose of levying special assessments to finance the amount that the district will be obligated to pay in accordance with the agreement, over and above any other funds which are on hand and properly available for that purpose. The assessment district must be of a size and form as to include all properties which in the judgment of the board, after consultation with a registered engineer designated by the board for that purpose, will be benefited by the construction of the proposed project, and the board shall direct the engineer to prepare a map showing the boundaries of the proposed assessment district. The board shall by resolution declare the necessity of the project, set forth the general nature and purpose of the proposed project, estimate the total cost of the project, and the approximate amount or fraction of the cost which the district will be obligated to pay under the agreement, and the fact that this amount, or a lesser amount as the board may specify, is proposed to be paid by the levy of special assessments upon property within the assessment district determined to be benefited by the project. The board shall cause the resolution of necessity together with a copy of the map showing the boundaries of the assessment district and a notice stating the date and time by which the owners of any property liable to be specially assessed for the proposed project must file their votes on the proposed project with the secretary of the board to be mailed to each landowner affected by the proposed project as determined by the tax rolls of the county in which the affected property is located. The board may send the material by certified mail or by regular mail attested by an affidavit of mailing signed by the attorney or secretary of the board. The notice must also set forth the time and place where the board shall meet to determine whether the project is approved. The notice must also be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the district and once in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located. Within five days after the first mailing of the resolution the board shall cause a copy of the resolution to be personally served upon any county, city, or township, in its corporate capacity which may be benefited directly or indirectly from the construction of the proposed project and upon any county which may become liable for any deficiency in the fund to be created for the project, by delivering a copy of the resolution to any member of the governing body thereof. The meeting must be held not less than thirty days after the mailing of the resolution, at which time the board shall determine whether the project is approved. If the board finds that fifty percent or more of the total votes filed are against a proposed project, then the board may not proceed further with the proposed project. If the board finds that less than fifty percent of votes filed are against the proposed project, the board may proceed with the project. In any assessment district created under this section the board may dispense with all other requirements of this chapter, other than those stated in this section. After the contract for the work has been let, the board may issue warrants on the fund of the project for the total amount of the cost thereof, and the board, without holding the hearing required by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-18" target="_self">61-16.1-18</a></cite>, shall proceed to determine and levy any assessments against property benefited by the project and prepare an assessment list all in accordance with the procedures required by sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-21" target="_self">61-16.1-21</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-24" target="_self">61-16.1-24</a></cite>.

       Financing project through revenue bonds, general taxes, or special assessments — Apportionment of benefits.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A water resource board shall have the authority, either upon request or by its own motion, to acquire needed interest in property and provide for the cost of construction, alteration, repair, operation, and maintenance of a project through issuance of improvement warrants or with funds raised by special assessments, general tax levy, issuance of revenue bonds, or by a combination of general ad valorem tax, special assessments, and revenue bonds. Whenever a water resource board decides to acquire property or interests in property to construct, operate, alter, repair, or maintain a project with funds raised in whole or in part through special assessments, such assessments shall be apportioned to and spread upon lands or premises benefited by the project in proportion to and in accordance with benefits accruing thereto. The board shall assess the proportion of the cost of the project, or the part of the cost to be financed with funds raised through levy and collection of special assessments which any lot, piece, or parcel of land shall bear in proportion to the benefits accruing thereto and any county, city, or township which is benefited thereby. In determining assessments, the water resource board shall carry out to the maximum extent possible the water management policy of this chapter that upstream landowners must share with downstream landowners the responsibility to provide for the proper management of surface waters.

The engineer shall prepare profiles, plans, and specifications of the proposed project and estimates of the total cost thereof. The estimate of costs prepared by the engineer shall include acquisition of right of way and shall be in sufficient detail to allow the board to determine the probable share of the total costs that will be assessed against each of the affected landowners in the proposed project assessment district.

      Upon the filing of the engineer’s report provided for in section 61-16.1-17, and after satisfying the requirements of section 61-16.1-21, the water resource board shall fix a date and place for public hearing on the proposed project. The place of hearing must be in the vicinity of the proposed project and must be convenient and accessible for the majority of the landowners subject to assessment for the project or whose property is subject to condemnation for the proposed project. The board shall cause a complete list of the benefits and assessments to be made, setting forth each county, township, or city assessed in its corporate capacity as well as each lot, piece, or parcel of land assessed, the amount each is benefited by the improvement and the amount assessed against each. At least ten days before the hearing, the board shall file with the county auditor of each county or counties in which the project is or will be located the list showing the percentage assessment against each parcel of land benefited by the proposed project and the approximate assessment in terms of money apportioned thereto. Notice of the filing must be included in the notice of hearing. Notices of the hearing must contain a copy of the resolution of the board as well as the time and place where the board will conduct the hearing. The notice of hearing must specify the general nature of the project as finally determined by the engineer and the board. The notice of hearing must also specify when and where votes concerning the proposed project may be filed. The assessment list showing the percentage assessment against each parcel of land benefited by the proposed project and the approximate assessment in terms of money apportioned thereto, along with a copy of the notice of the hearing, must be mailed to each affected landowner at the landowner’s address as shown by the tax rolls of the county or counties in which the affected property is located. The board may send the assessment list and notice by regular mail attested by an affidavit of mailing signed by the attorney or secretary of the board. The board shall cause the notice of hearing to be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in the newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the affected landowners reside and in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located. The date set for the hearing must not be less than twenty days after the mailing of the notice. A record of the hearing must be made by the board, including a list of affected landowners present in person or by agent, and the record must be preserved in the minutes of the meeting. Affected landowners, and the governing body of any county, township, or city to be assessed, must be informed at the hearing of the probable total cost of the project and their individual share of the cost and the portion of their property, if any, to be condemned for the project.

     <p>
      At the hearing, the affected landowners, and any county, township, or city to be assessed, must also be informed when and where votes concerning the proposed project may be filed. Affected landowners, and the governing body of any county, township, or city to be assessed, have thirty days after the date of the hearing to file their votes with the secretary of the water resource board concerning the project. Once the deadline for filing votes has been reached, no more votes may be filed and no person may withdraw a vote. Any withdrawal of a vote concerning the proposed project before that time must be in writing. When the votes have been filed and the deadline for filing votes has passed, the board shall immediately determine whether the project is approved. If the board finds that fifty percent or more of the total votes filed are against the proposed project, then the vote constitutes a bar against proceeding further with the project. If the board finds that the number of votes filed against the proposed project is less than fifty percent of the votes filed, the board shall issue an order establishing the proposed project and may proceed, after complying with the requirements of sections 61-16.1-21 and 61-16.1-22, to contract or provide for the construction or maintenance of the project in substantially the manner and according to the forms and procedure provided in title 40 for the construction of sewers within municipalities. The board may enter into an agreement with any federal or state agency under the terms of which the contract for the project is to be let by the federal agency, the state agency, or a combination thereof. In projects in which there is an agreement that a party other than the board will let the contract, the board may dispense with all of the requirements of title 40. Upon making an order establishing or denying establishment of a project, the board shall publish notice of the order in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the affected landowners reside and in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located. Any right of appeal begins to run on the date of publication of the notice. As used in this section, “board” means water resource board.

     <p>
      In order that there may be a fair relation between the amount of liability for assessments and the power of objecting to the establishment of a proposed project, the voting rights of affected landowners on the question of establishing the project are as provided in this section. The landowner or landowners of tracts of land affected by the project have one vote for each dollar of assessment that the land is subject to or one vote for each dollar of the assessed valuation of land condemned for the project, as determined in accordance with title 57. The governing body of any county, township, or city to be assessed also has one vote for each dollar of assessment against such county, township, or city. There may be only one vote for each dollar of assessment, regardless of the number of owners of such tract of land. Where more than one owner of such land exists, the votes must be prorated among them in accordance with each owner’s property interest. A written power of attorney authorizes an agent to protest a project on behalf of any affected landowner or landowners.

      Whenever the water resource board proposes to make any special assessment under the provisions of this chapter, the board, prior to the hearing required under section 61-16.1-18, shall inspect any and all lots and parcels of land, which may be subject to assessment and shall determine from the inspection the particular lots and parcels of lands which, in the opinion of the board, will be especially benefited by the construction of the work for which the assessment is made and shall assess the proportion of the total cost of acquiring right of way and constructing and maintaining such improvement in accordance with benefits received but not exceeding such benefits, against:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-21ol11">
       Any county, township, or city, in its corporate capacity, which may be benefited directly or indirectly thereby.

       Any lot, piece, or parcel of land which is directly benefited by such improvement.

      In determining benefits the board shall consider, among other factors, property values, degree of improvement of properties, productivity, and the water management policy as expressed in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-15" target="_self">61-16.1-15</a></cite>. Property belonging to the United States shall be exempt from such assessment, unless the United States has provided for the payment of any assessment which may be levied against its property for benefits received. Benefited property belonging to counties, cities, school districts, park districts, and townships shall not be exempt from such assessment and political subdivisions whose property is so assessed shall provide for the payment of such assessments, installments thereof, and interest thereon, by the levy of taxes according to law. Any county, township, or city assessed in its corporate capacity for benefits received shall provide for the payment of such assessments, installments thereof, and interest thereon from its general fund or by levy of a general property tax against all the taxable property therein in accordance with law. No tax limitation provided by any statute of this state shall apply to tax levies made by any such political subdivision for the purpose of paying any special assessments made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. There shall be attached to the list of assessments a certificate signed by a majority of the members of the board certifying that the same is a true and correct assessment of the benefit therein described to the best of their judgment and stating the several items of expense included in the assessment.

      After entering an order establishing the project, the water resource board shall cause the assessment list to be published once each week for three successive weeks in the newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the district and in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located together with a notice of the time when, and place where, the board will meet to hear objections to any assessment by any interested party, or an agent or attorney for that party. The board also shall mail a copy of the notice of the hearing in an envelope clearly marked “ASSESSMENT NOTICE” to each affected landowner at the landowner’s address as shown by the tax rolls of the county or counties in which the affected property is located. The date set for the hearing may not be less than thirty days after the mailing of the notice. At the hearing, the board may make such alterations in the assessments as in its opinion may be just and necessary to correct any error in the assessment but must make the aggregate of all assessments equal to the total amount required to pay the entire cost of the work for which the assessments are made, or the part of the cost to be paid by special assessment. An assessment may not exceed the benefit as determined by the board to the parcel of land or political subdivision assessed. The board shall then confirm the assessment list and the secretary shall attach to the list a certificate that the same is correct as confirmed by the board and shall file the list in the office of the secretary.

      After the hearing provided for in section 61-16.1-22, affected landowners and any political subdivision subject to assessment, having not less than twenty percent of the possible votes as determined by section 61-16.1-20, who believe the assessment was not made fairly or equitably or the project is not located or designed properly, may appeal to the department of water resources by petition, within ten days after the hearing on assessments, to make a review of the assessments and to examine the location and design of the proposed project. Upon receipt of the petition the department shall examine the lands assessed and the location and design of the proposed project, and if it appears the assessments were not made equitably, the department may correct the assessments, and the department’s correction and adjustment of the assessment is final. If the department believes the project was located or designed improperly, the department may order a relocation and redesign that must be followed in the construction of the proposed project. Upon filing a bond for two hundred fifty dollars with the board for the payment of the costs of the department in the matter, any landowner or political subdivision claiming the landowner or political subdivision will receive no benefit from the construction of a new project may appeal that issue to the department within ten days after the hearing on assessments. Upon an appeal by an individual landowner or political subdivision, the department may determine whether there is any benefit to the landowner or political subdivision, but not the specific amount of benefit. The determination of the department regarding whether there is a benefit is final.

   In a dispute regarding a clearing and snagging project, several landowners were not required to appeal a determination of benefited land to a state engineer to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to appealing to a district court because the cost of the project was less than $100,000; therefore, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-23" target="_self">61-16.1-23</a></cite> did not apply as N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-23" target="_self">61-16.1-23</a></cite> applies only after the provisions of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-22" target="_self">61-16.1-22</a></cite> have been followed and projects costing less than $ 100,000 are not subject to the assessment procedures required by N.D.C.C.

      In June and December of each year and as otherwise required by the county commission appointing the managers of the district, the district treasurer shall report to the water resource board in writing the amount of money in the treasury, the receipts, if any, in the preceding period and the amount and items of expenditure during that period. The report shall be verified and filed with the secretary of the district. A verified copy of the report shall also be filed in the office of the county auditor of each county in which the district lies and shall be open to public inspection.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the month of January of each year, the water resource board shall prepare a complete statement of the condition of the finances of the district for the past year and shall cause the same to be filed with the county auditor of each county in which the district lies on or before February first next following. Such statement shall show separately, and in detail, the condition and resources of each and every assessment fund for the payment of project warrants of the district, including the amount of any anticipated deficit and the apportionment thereof. At its February meeting next following the filing of the statement of condition of any district, the board of county commissioners shall examine the statement and make inquiry regarding the same to determine whether or not the district has defaulted or may soon default on payment of its financial obligations as the same become due.

      Whenever all special assessments collected for a project are insufficient to pay the special assessment warrants issued against such project, coming due within the following thirteen months, with interest, the board of county commissioners of each of the counties wherein the district lies shall advance to the district project warrant fund an amount sufficient to pay the deficiency attributable to benefited property in each county. If it appears to the board at any time that a deficiency exists or is likely to occur within one year in such project warrant fund for the payment of principal or interest due or to become due on such warrants, the board of county commissioners of each of the counties wherein the district lies, in order to forestall imminent deficiency in such fund or to promptly restore the ability of such fund to pay principal and interest punctually as the same become due, shall advance to such project fund the amount necessary to cover the anticipated deficiency attributable to benefited property in such county. In order to make such advances, the board of county commissioners of each of the counties shall levy a general tax upon the taxable property in the county, and may issue certificates of indebtedness against levies so made, or shall pay such advances from its general fund. Advances made by the county or counties shall be obligations of the district to be met out of any surplus in the district project warrant fund, and future district budgets and tax levies for the district after provision has been made for necessary current expenses. No tax limitation provided by any statute of this state shall apply to tax levies made by any county for the purpose of making any advances in accordance with the provisions of this section.

     <p>
      The water resource board may hold at any time or, upon petition of any affected landowner or political subdivision which has been assessed after a project has been in existence for at least one year, shall hold a hearing for the purpose of determining the benefits of such project to each tract of land affected. Notice of the hearing must be given by publication once each week for three consecutive weeks, beginning at least thirty days before the hearing, in the newspaper or newspapers having general circulation in the district and in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located and by mailing notice of the hearing in an envelope clearly marked “ASSESSMENT NOTICE” to each owner of land in the assessed district at the landowner’s address as shown by the tax rolls of the counties in which the affected property is located. The provisions of this chapter governing the original determination of benefits and assessment of costs apply to any reassessment of benefits carried out under this section. The board may not be forced to make such reassessment more than once every ten years, nor may any assessment or balance thereof supporting a project fund be reduced or impaired by reassessment or otherwise so long as bonds payable out of such fund remain unpaid and moneys are not available in such fund to pay all such bonds in full, with interest. Costs of maintenance must be prorated in accordance with any plan for reassessment of benefits that has been adopted.

     <p>
      A district may, at any time after entering into a contract for a project to be financed in whole or in part by special assessments, issue temporary and definitive warrants on the project fund, created for that purpose, in the manner and subject to the limitations prescribed in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-24s40-24-19" target="_blank">40-24-19</a></cite>. If the warrants are issued to finance a sewer or water project, the net revenues derived from the imposition of service charges to be imposed and collected with respect thereto as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-22s40-22-16" target="_blank">40-22-16</a></cite> may be pledged to payment of those warrants, except that the first maturity date of any such warrant shall not be less than two years from the date of issuance. Warrants issued under this section shall be in such amounts as in the judgment of the water resource board will be necessary for the project. The warrants shall bear interest at a rate or rates and be sold at a price resulting in an average net interest cost not exceeding twelve percent per annum if sold at private sale. There is no interest rate ceiling on warrant issues sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. Coupons evidencing the interest for each year or half year, as the case may be, may be attached to the warrants. The warrants shall state upon their face the purpose for which they are issued and the project fund from which they are payable and shall be signed by the chairman of the water resource board and countersigned by the secretary of the district. The warrants shall be payable serially in such amounts as the board determines, extending over a period of not more than thirty years.

     <p>
      No dikes, dams, or other devices for water conservation, flood control regulation, watershed improvement, or storage of water which are capable of retaining, obstructing, or diverting more than fifty acre-feet [61674.08 cubic meters] of water or twenty-five acre-feet [30837.04 cubic meters] of water for a medium-hazard or high-hazard dam, may be constructed within any district except in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. An application for the construction of any dike, dam, or other device, along with complete plans and specifications, must be presented first to the department of water resources. Except for low-hazard dams less than ten feet [3.05 meters] in height or agricultural dikes less than two feet [0.61 meters] in height, the plans and specifications must be completed by a professional engineer registered in this state. After receipt, the department shall consider the application in such detail as the department deems necessary and proper. The department shall refuse to allow the construction of any unsafe or improper dike, dam, or other device which would interfere with the orderly control of the water resources of the district, or may order changes, conditions, or modifications as in the judgment of the department may be necessary for safety or the protection of property. Within forty-five days after receipt of the application, except in unique or complex situations, the department shall complete the initial review of the application and forward the application, along with any changes, conditions, or modifications, to the water resource board of the district within which the contemplated project is located. The board shall consider the application within forty-five days, and suggest any changes, conditions, or modifications to the department. If the board approves the application, the board shall forward the approved application to the department. If the board fails to respond within forty-five days, the board will be deemed to have no changes, conditions, or modifications to make. The department shall make the final decision on the application and forward that decision to the applicant and the local water resource board. The department may issue temporary permits for dikes, dams, or other devices in cases of an emergency. Any person constructing a dam, dike, or other device capable of retaining, obstructing, or diverting more than fifty acre-feet [61674.08 cubic meters] of water or twenty-five acre-feet [30837.04 cubic meters] of water for a medium-hazard or high-hazard dam, without first securing a permit to do so, as required by this section, is liable for all damages proximately caused by the dam, dike, or other device, and is guilty of a class B misdemeanor.

       Maintenance of federally constructed projects — Assessment district established.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      With regard to projects constructed by a federal agency, including the soil conservation service or natural resources conservation service, the water resource board may finance in whole or in part the maintenance of the project with funds raised through the collection of a special assessment levied against the land and premises benefited by maintenance of the project. The assessments to be levied may not exceed four dollars per acre [.40 hectare] annually on agricultural lands and may not exceed two dollars annually for each five hundred dollars of taxable valuation of nonagricultural property. No action is required for the establishment of the assessment district or the assessments except the water resource board must approve the maintenance and assessment therefor by a vote of two-thirds of the members and the board of county commissioners of the county in which the project is located must approve and levy the assessments to be made by a vote of two-thirds of its members. If a board that undertakes a project finds that the project may benefit lands in this state outside water resource district boundaries, the board shall provide notice to the water resource board where the benefited lands are located. The board of each water resource district containing lands benefited by a project must approve the project and assessment by vote of two-thirds of its members. The board of county commissioners in each county that contains lands benefited by a project must approve and levy the assessment to be made by vote of two-thirds of its members. If a project and assessment is not approved by all affected water resource boards and boards of county commissioners, the board of each water resource district and the board of county commissioners of each county shall meet to ensure that all common water management problems are jointly addressed. In addition, the water resource board that undertakes the project may proceed with the project if the board finances the cost of the project and does not assess land outside of the district. Before an assessment may be levied under this section, a public hearing must be held. The hearing must be preceded by notice as to date, time, location, and subject matter published in the official newspaper in the county or counties in which the proposed assessment is to be levied. The notice must be published at least ten days but not more than thirty days before the public hearing.

   This section substantially advances a legitimate state interest in drainage and does not deny a railroad economically viable use of its track; it constitutionally places upon railroad the continuing responsibility for the costs of accommodating its track to necessary drainage improvements.

   Without a more explicit legislative declaration of an intent to extend the power and authority of water resource districts to manage diffused surface waters under this provision, Court declined to extend the authority of a water resource district to require Burlington Northern Railway Company to install a culvert through the bed of its railroad track. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. Benson County Water Resource Dist., 2000 ND 182, 618 N.W.2d 155, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>

   Water resource district had a right to intervene in a property owner’s action against a township involving a culvert because the district was situated so that the disposition of the action might, as a practical matter, impair or impede its ability to protect its interests. The impact of a new culvert would cause the flow of water to enter into the drain that the district was mandated to maintain.

     <p>
      The water resource board shall construct such bridges or culverts over or in connection with a drain as in its judgment may be necessary to furnish passage from one part to another of any private farm or tract of land intersected by such drain. The cost of such construction shall be charged as part of the cost of constructing the drain, and any such bridge, culvert, or passageway shall be maintained under the authority of the water resource board, and the necessary expense shall be deemed a part of the cost of maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whenever any bridge or culvert is to be constructed on a county or township highway system over and across or in connection with a drain, the cost of constructing such bridge or culvert shall be shared in the following manner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-43ol11">
       The state water commission may, if funds are available, participate in accordance with such rules and regulations as it may prescribe. The remaining cost shall be borne forty percent by the county and sixty percent by the district which has created the need for such construction.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-43ol12">
       If, however, moneys have not been made available to the commission for participation in accordance with subsection 1, then forty percent of the cost of a bridge or culvert shall be paid by the county and sixty percent shall be charged as the cost of the drain to the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-43ol13">
       Where such bridges or culverts are constructed with federal financial participation, the costs exceeding the amount of the federal participation shall be borne by the district and county according to the provisions of this section, as the case may be.

      If any of the proceedings for the location, establishment, or construction of any drain under the provisions of this chapter shall have been enjoined, vacated, set aside, declared void, or voluntarily abandoned by the water resource board, for any reason whatsoever, the board may proceed under the provisions of sections 61-16.1-17 through 61-16.1-22 to locate, establish, and construct a new drain at substantially the same location as the abandoned or invalid drain. For the purposes of this chapter, a drain that is not properly maintained shall be considered abandoned. When a new drain is established at substantially the same location, the board shall ascertain the real value of services rendered, moneys expended and work done under the invalid or abandoned proceedings, and the extent to which the same contributes to the construction and completion of the new drain. The board shall then issue warrants in an amount not exceeding the value to the new drain of the work completed on the invalid or abandoned drain and shall deliver such new warrants, pro rata, to the owners or holders of old warrants or bonds issued under the invalid or abandoned drainage proceedings, upon the surrender of such old warrants or bonds by the holder or holders thereof.

       For the purposes of this section, “lateral drain” means a drain constructed after the establishment of an original assessment drain or drainage system and which flows into such original drain or drainage system from outside the limits of the assessed area of the original drain; provided, that a determination by a water resource board as to whether an existing or proposed drain is a lateral or a new drain shall be conclusive when entered upon the records of the board.

A petition for a lateral drain shall be sufficient if signed by one or more property owners whose property will be affected by the lateral drain. Whenever improvements of an original drain are made necessary by the construction of a lateral drain, the costs of such improvements to the original drain shall be charged as part of the cost of construction of the lateral drain and assessed against the property benefited thereby and collected as other assessments are collected. In the event the board determines that improvements to the original drain are also beneficial to property served by the original drain, the board may assess that portion of the cost of the improvements it determines appropriate to property benefited by the original drain. Unless the petitioners agree to construct the lateral drain, the board, within ten days, may commence proceedings for the construction of the lateral drain according to the provisions of this chapter. No person shall dig or construct any lateral ditch or drain which will conduct the flow of water from any land or lands into any drain constructed under the provisions of this chapter, except as provided in this section and with approval of the board. In all instances involving the construction of a lateral drain, the board shall estimate and determine the proportionate share of the cost of the main or original drain which should be paid by the petitioners. The petitioners shall pay into the district treasury the amount so determined, and shall then be allowed to connect such lateral ditches or drains with the original drain under the direction and superintendence of the board, but at their own cost and expense. The money paid into the county treasury shall be credited to the drainage fund of the specific drain involved.

       If a water resource board determines that an obstruction to a drain has been caused by the negligent act or omission of a landowner or tenant, the board shall notify the landowner by registered mail at the landowner’s post-office address of record. A copy of the notice must also be sent to the tenant, if any. The notice must specify the nature and extent of the obstruction, the opinion of the board as to its cause, and must state that if the obstruction is not removed within such period as the board determines, but not less than fifteen days, the board shall procure removal of the obstruction and assess the cost of the removal, or the portion the board determines appropriate, against the property of the landowner responsible. The notice must also state that the affected landowner, within fifteen days of the date the notice is mailed, may demand, in writing, a hearing on the matter. Upon receipt of the demand, the board shall set a hearing date within fifteen days from the date the demand is received. In the event of an emergency, the board may immediately apply to the appropriate district court for an injunction prohibiting a landowner or tenant from maintaining an obstruction. Assessments levied under the provisions of this section must be collected in the same manner as other assessments authorized by this chapter. If, in the opinion of the board, more than one landowner or tenant has been responsible, the costs may be assessed on a pro rata basis in accordance with the proportionate responsibility of the landowners. A landowner aggrieved by action of the board under this section may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the land is located in accordance with the procedure provided in section 28-34-01. A hearing as provided for in this section is not a prerequisite to an appeal. If a complaint is frivolous in the discretion of the board, the board may assess the costs of the frivolous complaint against the complainant. If the obstruction is located in a road ditch, the timing and method of removal must be approved by the appropriate road authority before the notice required by this section is given and appropriate construction site protection standards must be followed.

       Upon receipt of a complaint of unauthorized construction of a dike, dam, or other device for water conservation, flood control, regulation, watershed improvement, or storage of water, the water resource board shall promptly investigate and make a determination thereon. If the board determines that a dike, dam, or other device, capable of retaining, obstructing, or diverting more than fifty acre-feet [61674.08 cubic meters] of water or twenty-five acre-feet [30837.04 cubic meters] of water for a medium-hazard or high-hazard dam, has been established or constructed by a landowner or tenant contrary to this title or any rules adopted by the board, the board shall notify the landowner by certified mail at the landowner’s post-office address of record. A copy of the notice must also be sent to the tenant, if any. The notice must specify the nature and extent of the noncompliance and must state that if the dike, dam, or other device is not removed within the period the board determines, but not less than fifteen days, the board shall cause the removal of the dike, dam, or other device and assess the cost of the removal, or the portion the board determines, against the property of the landowner responsible. The notice must also state that the affected landowner, within fifteen days of the date the notice is mailed, may demand, in writing, a hearing upon the matter. Upon receipt of the demand, the board shall set a hearing date within fifteen days from the date the demand is received. In the event of an emergency, the board may immediately apply to the appropriate district court for an injunction prohibiting the landowner or tenant from constructing or maintaining the dike, dam, or other device, or ordering the landowner to remove the dike, dam, or other device. Assessments levied under this section must be collected in the same manner as other assessments authorized by this chapter. If, in the opinion of the board, more than one landowner or tenant has been responsible, the costs may be assessed on a pro rata basis in proportion to the responsibility of the landowners. If a complaint is frivolous in the discretion of the board, the board may assess the costs of the frivolous complaint against the complainant.

        Removal of Unauthorized Dike.

   The District did not misapply the law of prescriptive easements when it ordered the removal of the dikes, because landowners cannot defeat the State’s authority to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public by claiming a prescriptive right to maintain dikes which were constructed in violation of state law.

   Property owner and farming association failed to show that a water resource district acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably in finding that a dike system required a permit under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-38" target="_self">61-16.1-38</a></cite>, that the evidence was not substantial, or that the district was estopped from requiring removal of the dikes under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-16.1s61-16.1-53" target="_self">61-16.1-53</a></cite>.

   District court properly dismissed a landowner's appeal from a county water resource district decision amending approval of an application for a subsurface drain because the landowner failed to file a timely appeal from the resource district decision; the terms of the statutes conferring appellate jurisdiction controlled whether the time for appeal could be tolled, and nothing in the plain language of the statute tolled the time for appeal.

      Beginning on July 1, 1981, each water resource district shall assume all assets, liabilities, and obligations of any county drain board whose territory is included within the boundaries of the district. When the jurisdiction of any county drain board is included within two or more districts, the county auditor shall determine the apportionment of any assets, liabilities, and obligations. Such apportionment shall be based on the proportionate amount of taxable valuation included in each district, except that special assessment projects and funds, property interests, and physical assets attached to the land shall be assumed by the district in which the project is located. Property interests and physical assets attached to the land shall be assumed by the district in which they are located. Prior to February 1, 1983, and for review by each affected water resource board, each water resource district and county drain board shall have a certified public accountant prepare a final audit of its financial records, including all special assessment funds and obligations, assets, and other liabilities. All necessary actions to accomplish the transfer of assets and obligations under this section shall be complete prior to January 1, 1982.

       Legislative intent and purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds and declares that a large portion of the state’s land resources is subject to recurrent flooding by overflow of streams and other watercourses causing loss of life and property, disruption of commerce and governmental services, unsanitary conditions, and interruption of transportation and communications, all of which are detrimental to the health, safety, welfare, and property of the occupants of flooded lands and the people of this state. The legislative assembly further finds that public interest necessitates that the floodplains of this state be developed in a manner which will alleviate loss of life and threat to health, and reduce private and public economic loss caused by flooding.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the policy of this state and the purpose of this chapter to guide development of the floodplains of this state in accordance with the enumerated legislative findings, to reduce flood damages through sound floodplain management, stressing nonstructural measures such as floodplain zoning and floodproofing, acquisition and relocation, and flood warning practices; and to ensure as far as practicable that the channels and those portions of the floodplains of watercourses which are the floodways are not inhabited and are kept free and clear of interference or obstructions which may cause any undue restriction of the capacity of the floodways.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is also the policy of this state and purpose of this chapter to provide state coordination and assistance to communities in floodplain management activities, to encourage communities to adopt, administer, and enforce sound floodplain management ordinances, and to provide the department of water resources the authority necessary to carry out and enforce a floodplain management program for the state and to coordinate federal, state, and local floodplain management activities in this state.

      Before issuing a permit or authorization to allow a use in a regulatory floodway, the community responsible for permitting or authorizing the use shall notify the department of the proposed use. The department shall determine whether a functioning hydraulic model is needed to measure the effect of the proposed use. Upon the request of the department, the community shall submit to the department for review all technical documentation, including a functioning hydraulic model and other technical information needed for the department’s review to analyze the proposed use and to identify its proposed impact. The department shall complete the review within thirty days after receiving the technical documentation. Upon completion of the review, the department shall notify the community whether the proposed use is in compliance with state and federal law. A community may apply to the department for an exemption on a case-by-case basis from this section. The department may grant the exemption if the department determines the community, by using its own technical review, can determine whether the proposed use is in compliance with state and federal law.

      Every person, stock company, association, corporation, or limited liability company owning or controlling the real estate upon which is located an artesian or flowing well shall provide for each such well a valve or valves capable of controlling the discharge from such well and shall keep such valve or valves so adjusted that only such supply of water shall escape as is necessary for ordinary use by the owner, or the person in control, of such land, in conducting the owner’s or person’s business. In the winter, such flow may be permitted as will prevent freezing of the well, and when it is necessary, a sufficient flow may be allowed for the purposes of developing the well. The owner of an artesian well shall be required, by means of the construction of a reservoir or otherwise, to prevent the flow of the owner’s well from running upon land belonging to another or from running into any ditch along any public highway except a regularly established drainage ditch.

     <p>
      As part of the design and construction of a proposed assessment drain or the maintenance or reconstruction of an existing assessment drain, the board, upon approval of the appropriate road authority, may locate, relocate, size, and install culverts through roads which are not on the routes of assessment drains but which are within the assessment area and which are necessary for surface water to reach the assessment drain. The design and installation of culverts under this section must be consistent with chapters 24-03 and 24-06 and the streamcrossing and construction site protection standards prepared by the department of transportation and the department of water resources.

     <p>
      Upon presentation of a petition as provided in section 61-21-10, the board shall examine the line of the proposed drain, and if in its opinion further proceedings are warranted, it shall adopt a resolution to that effect and designate a competent surveyor or engineer to assist the board. For the purpose of making examinations or surveys, the board or its employees may enter upon any land traversed by any proposed drain or any other lands necessary to gain access thereto. The surveyor or engineer shall prepare profiles, plans, and specifications of the proposed drain, estimates of the total cost thereof, and a map or plan of the lands to be drained showing the regular subdivisions thereof, which map or plan shall be filed in the office of the county auditor for inspection by the public. In determining the best location for the proposed drain, the board may in its discretion set the location on lines differing from the lines described in the petition. When the length of line described in the petition does not give sufficient fall to drain the land sought to be drained, the board may extend the drain below the outlet named in the petition. The estimate of costs prepared by the surveyor or engineer shall be in sufficient detail to allow the board to determine the probable share of the total costs that will be assessed against each of the affected landowners in the proposed drainage district.

     <p>
      Upon the filing of the surveyor’s or engineer’s report provided for in section 61-21-12, the board shall fix a date and place for public hearing on the petition. Such place of hearing shall be in the vicinity of the proposed drain and shall be convenient and accessible for the majority of the landowners subject to assessment for such drain or whose property shall be subject to condemnation for the proposed drain. At least ten days before such hearing, the board shall file with the county auditor a list showing the percentage assessment against each parcel of land benefited by the proposed drain and the approximate assessment in terms of money apportioned thereto. Notice of such filing shall be included in the notice of hearing on the petition. At least ten days’ notice of such hearing shall be given by publishing a notice at least once in the official newspaper of the county in which the proposed drain is located. In addition, each owner of land subject to assessment for the proposed drain and each landowner whose property shall be subject to condemnation for the proposed drain as shown by the record in the office of the recorder shall be mailed a notice of such hearing at the owner’s post-office address as shown by such records. Notices of such hearing shall contain a copy of the petition and the time and place where the board will act upon the petition. The notice of hearing shall specify the point or place of beginning of the proposed drain and where it terminates, and shall describe the general course of the drain as finally determined by the engineer and the board. The notice of hearing shall also specify when and where votes for and against such proposed drain shall be filed. The final date when votes must be filed shall not be less than ten days after the date of the hearing on the petition. A form of ballot shall be mailed with the notice of hearing for use by the affected landowners in voting for or against the proposed drain. An affidavit of mailing signed by the attorney or clerk of the board or other person mailing such notices shall be filed with the county auditor who shall file such affidavit with the records of the proceedings pertaining to that drain. All persons whose land may be subject to assessment for such drain or whose property shall be subject to condemnation for such drain may appear before the board, fully express their opinions, and offer evidence upon the matters pertaining thereto.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Prior to the hearing provided for in section 61-21-13, the board shall first prepare a roster or roll of affected landowners subject to assessment for such drain or whose property shall be subject to condemnation for such drain, and shall limit voting rights to such landowners. A record shall be made by the board of affected landowners present in person or by agent and such records shall be preserved in the minutes of the meeting. Affected landowners shall then be informed of the probable total cost of the project and their individual share of such cost and the amount of their property to be condemned for such project. The board shall fix a time, which shall not be less than ten days after the hearing on the petition, within which the votes for and against the establishment of the proposed drain shall be filed with the board. Objections to or approvals of the drain in writing may be filed with the board and shall be considered as votes for or against the proposed drain, as the case may be. A telegram shall be deemed writing, and any form of written approval or objection which sufficiently indicates the intention of the writer shall be sufficient. Once the deadline for filing votes for or against the proposed drain has been reached, no more votes for or against such drain shall be filed and no person shall withdraw that person’s name from the list of those voting for or against the proposed drain after the deadline for filing votes has been reached. Any withdrawals of objections to or approvals of the proposed drain before that time shall be in writing only. When the votes of affected landowners have been filed and the deadline for filing votes for and against such drain has been reached, the board shall immediately proceed to determine whether or not more than fifty percent of the votes filed, as determined by section 61-21-16, are in favor of the construction of the drain. Until such determination is made, the board is without jurisdiction to take any further steps in the matter except to determine whether more than fifty percent of the votes filed are in favor of the drain and to adopt a resolution for discontinuance, if not more than fifty percent of the votes filed favor construction of the drain.

An objection in writing filed with the board shall, as provided in section 61-21-13, be considered the same as a vote by ballot. The board may bring an action against the petitioners or upon their bond for all costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings, in which case the petitioners shall be jointly and severally liable, or the board may pay the costs and expenses out of any moneys available. If it shall appear, after due hearing as provided in sections 61-21-13 and 61-21-14, that the proposed drain will not cost more than the amount of the benefits to be derived therefrom and is approved by more than fifty percent of the votes of the affected landowners filed with the board as determined by section 61-21-16, the board shall make an order establishing the drain, accurately describing it, and giving the same a name under which it shall be recorded and indexed.

      In order that there may be a fair relation between the amount of liability for assessments and the power of objecting to the establishment of a proposed drain, the voice or vote of affected landowners on the question of establishing the drain shall be arrived at in the following manner:
     </p>
     <p>
      The landowner or landowners of tracts of land affected by the drain shall have one vote for each dollar of assessment that the owner’s land is subject to or one vote for each dollar of the assessed valuation of land condemned for the drain, as estimated by the board under the provisions of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-21s61-21-12" target="_self">61-21-12</a></cite>. It is the intent of this section to allow one vote for each dollar of assessment, regardless of the number of owners of such tract of land. Where more than one owner of such land exists, the votes shall be prorated among them in accordance with each owner’s interest.
     </p>

      A written power of attorney shall authorize an agent to cast the votes of any affected landowners.

       Appeal to district court — Time — Undertaking — Hearing.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person whose land is assessed or may be assessed or is condemned or may be condemned for the construction of a drain under the provisions of this chapter may appeal to the district court from the order of the board establishing or denying the establishment of the drain. The appeal must be taken in accordance with the procedure provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-34s28-34-01" target="_blank">28-34-01</a></cite>. The appellant must give an undertaking to be approved by the clerk of district court in the sum of two hundred fifty dollars for the payment of the costs in the event that the appellant is unsuccessful in the district court. The undertaking must run in favor of the county in which the drain is located, and, if located in more than one county, it may run in the name of either of the counties in which the drain is located. The judge shall hear the appeal not less than ten days nor more than thirty days after the filing of the appeal with the clerk, the day of hearing to be fixed by the court, but such time for hearing may be extended by the court for good cause for a period not to exceed thirty days. The case must be tried in all respects as a court case without a jury. Where the appeal is perfected, the district court upon the hearing may try and determine the question as to whether, in the first instance, there was sufficient cause for making the petition for the establishment of the drain, whether the proposed drain will cost more than the amount of the benefits to be derived therefrom, and whether such drain was objected to by a majority of the affected landowners in accordance with the weighted voting provisions of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-21s61-21-16" target="_self">61-21-16</a></cite>.

   When the board of drain commissioners proceeded by statute, its action was final, and the court would not inquire into correctness of determinations upon questions within board’s jurisdiction, except for fraud or other ground for equitable interference. Bergen Township v. Nelson County, 33 N.D. 247, 156 N.W. 559, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 1915).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to chapter 32-15, the right of way for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a proposed drain, if not conveyed to the county by the owner, may be acquired by eminent domain. If lands assessed for drainage benefits are not contiguous to the drain, access right of way thereto over the land of others may be acquired in the same manner. The right of way, when acquired, is the property of the county. The board may issue warrants in a sum sufficient to pay the damages assessed for the right of way. The warrants must be drawn upon the proper county treasurer or, if the water resource district treasurer is custodian of the drain funds, water resource district treasurer, and are payable out of drain funds in the hands of the treasurer that have been collected for the construction of the drain for which the right of way is sought to be obtained. The board shall negotiate the warrants at not less than the par value thereof and shall pay into court for the benefit of the owners of the right of way the amount to which each is entitled according to the assessment of damages, paying the surplus, if any, to the county treasurer or water resource district treasurer, who shall place the same to the credit of the proper drain fund.

     <p>
      At the hearing provided for in section 61-21-21, the board shall proceed to hear all complaints relative to the percentage assessments and shall correct or confirm the same. Should landowners subject to assessment or whose property is subject to condemnation for the construction of the proposed drain having a majority of the possible votes, as determined by section 61-21-16, believe that the assessment had not been fairly or equitably made, or that the drain is not properly located or designed, they may appeal to the department of water resources by petition within ten days after the hearing on assessments, to review the percentage assessments and to examine the location and design of the proposed drain. Upon the receipt of the petition, the department shall examine the lands assessed and the location and design of the proposed drain, and should the department determine the assessments have not been made equitably, the department may correct the assessments, and the department’s correction and adjustment of assessments are final. Should the department determine the drain has been improperly located or designed, the department may order a relocation and redesign. The relocation and redesign must be followed in the construction of the proposed drain. For the department’s services in reviewing the assessments and examining the location and design, the department is entitled to ten dollars per day and actual and necessary expenses during the time the department is engaged upon the work. All moneys received by the department must be paid into the state treasury and credited to the general fund. After the hearing provided in this section, the board shall make a finding that the benefits to all tracts of land will exceed the costs that will be assessed against the lands. Any landowner who claims the landowner will receive no benefit from the construction of a new drain may appeal the question of whether there is any benefit to the department upon the filing of a bond in the sum of two hundred fifty dollars with the board for the payment of the costs of the department in the matter. The department may not determine the specific amount of benefits upon an appeal by an individual landowner, but shall determine only whether there is any benefit to the landowner, and the determination of the department is final.

   Expenditures of highway funds for construction and maintenance of bridge or culvert where drain crossed highway did not violate N.D. Const. Art, X, § 11 since fact that bridge or culvert was required because of construction of drain, rather than because of presence of regular watercourse or rough spot in terrain, would not alter fact that such bridge or culvert would be part of highway.

   Property owner’s petition for writ of mandamus, compelling a township to install a bigger culvert to aid in drainage, was properly denied because, although better drainage could have been provided, the law did not require perfect drainage, and the court found that the rain event, which the owner claimed demonstrated the drainage problems and the failure to meet the stream crossing standards on his property, was a cataclysmic event, and in excess of a 100-year flood, not a 10-year event as contemplated by the stream crossing standards for a township road.

      The board shall construct such bridges or culverts over or in connection with a drain as in its judgment may be necessary to furnish passage from one part to another of any private farm or tract of land intersected by such drain. The cost of the construction thereof shall be charged as part of the cost of constructing such drain, and such bridge or passageway shall be maintained under the authority of the board, and the necessary expense thereof shall be deemed a part of the cost of keeping such drain open and in repair. Whenever any bridge or culvert is to be constructed on a county or township highway system over and across or in connection with a drain, and the cost thereof shall exceed five hundred dollars, the cost of constructing such bridge or culvert shall be shared in the following manner: The state water commission may, if funds are available therefor, participate in the portion of the cost thereof that exceeds five hundred dollars in accordance with such rules and regulations as it may prescribe. The remaining cost thereof shall be borne on the basis of forty percent by the county and sixty percent by the water resource district or the drainage district which has created the need for such construction. If, however, moneys have not been made available to the commission for such participation, then and in that case, forty percent of the cost of a bridge or culvert costing in excess of one hundred dollars shall be paid by the county and sixty percent shall be charged as cost of the drain to the drainage district. Whenever any bridge or culvert costing one hundred dollars or less is needed on any such road, the cost of such bridge or culvert shall be charged on the basis of sixty percent to the water resource district or the drainage district and forty percent shall be borne by the township in which such bridge or culvert is located.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the case of such bridge or culvert construction when there is federal financial participation, if there are costs exceeding the amount of such federal participation then the excess balance shall be borne by the water resource district, drainage district, county, or township, according to the foregoing provisions of this section, as the case may be.

       Procedure to construct or extend a drain through or into two or more counties.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to construct or extend a drain through or into two or more counties in this state, a petition must be presented to the several boards for the establishment of the drain in their several counties as provided in this chapter. The boards of the counties shall hold a joint meeting and shall determine the necessity or expediency of the establishment of the drain. The several boards of all counties through or into which the proposed drain may run shall agree upon the proportion of damages and benefits to accrue to the lands affected in each county, and for this purpose the boards shall consider the entire course of the drain through all the counties as one drain. Should the boards fail to agree upon the benefits to accrue to the lands in each county, the boards shall submit the points in controversy to the department of water resources, and the department’s decision is final. The boards may apportion the cost of establishing and constructing the entire drain ratably and equitably upon the lands in each county in proportion to the benefits to accrue to the county’s lands. When the boards have apportioned the costs, the boards shall make written reports of the apportionment to the auditors of the several counties affected. The reports must show the portion of cost of the entire drain to be paid by taxes upon the lands in each of the counties and must be signed by the boards of all counties affected. Upon the filing of the reports, the several boards shall meet and assess against the lands in each of the counties, ratably and equitably as provided by this chapter, an amount sufficient to pay the proportion of the cost of the drain in each county. The provisions of this chapter relating to drains within a single county govern the establishment, construction, maintenance, repair, and cleanout of the drains.

Whenever improvements of an original drain are made necessary by the construction of a lateral drain, the costs of such improvements to the original drain shall be charged as part of the cost of construction of the lateral drain and assessed against the property benefited thereby and collected as other assessments are collected. In the event that the board shall determine that such improvements to the original drain are also beneficial to property served by the original drain, the board may assess such portion of the cost of the improvements as it shall determine to property benefited by the original drain.

The petitioners shall pay into the county treasury the amount so determined, and they shall then be allowed to connect such lateral ditches or drains with the original drain under the direction and superintendence of the board, but at their own cost and expense.

      If any of the proceedings for the location, establishment, or construction of any drain under the provisions of this chapter shall have been enjoined, vacated, set aside, declared void, or voluntarily abandoned by the board, for any reason whatsoever, the board may proceed under the provisions of this chapter to locate, establish, and construct a new drain at substantially the same location as the abandoned or invalid drain.

When a new drain is established at substantially the same location, the board shall ascertain the real value of services rendered, moneys expended, and work done under the invalid or abandoned proceedings and the extent to which the same contributes to the construction and completion of the new drain. The board shall then issue warrants in an amount not exceeding the value to the new drain of the work completed on the invalid or abandoned drain and shall deliver such new warrants, pro rata, to the owners or holders of old warrants or bonds issued under the invalid or abandoned drainage proceedings, upon the surrender of such old warrants or bonds by the holder or holders thereof.

The governing body of any incorporated city, by agreement with the board, is authorized to contribute to the cost of cleaning out, repairing, and maintaining a drain in excess of the amount assessed under this section, and such excess contribution may be expended for such purposes by the board.

       Removal of obstructions to drain — Notice and hearing — Appeal — Injunction.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the board determines that an obstruction to a drain, including if the drain is located within a road ditch, has been caused by the negligent act or omission of a landowner or landowner’s tenant, the board shall notify the landowner by registered mail at the landowner’s post office of record. A copy of the notice must also be sent to the tenant, if any. The notice must specify the nature and extent of the obstruction, the opinion of the board as to its cause, and must state that if the obstruction is not removed within the period the board determines, but not less than fifteen days, the board shall procure removal of the obstruction and assess the cost of the removal, or the portion the board determines, against the property of the landowner responsible. The notice must also state that the affected landowner, within fifteen days of the date the notice is mailed, may demand in writing a hearing upon the matter. Upon receipt of the demand, the board shall set a hearing date within fifteen days from the date the demand is received. In the event of an emergency the board may, immediately upon learning of the existence of the obstruction, apply to a court of proper jurisdiction for an injunction prohibiting the landowner or landowner’s tenant to maintain the obstruction. Assessments levied under this section must be collected in the same manner as other assessments authorized by this chapter. If, in the opinion of the board, more than one landowner or tenant has been responsible, the costs may be assessed on a pro rata basis in accordance with the proportionate responsibility of the landowners. A landowner aggrieved by action of the board under this section may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the land is located in accordance with the procedure provided for in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-34s28-34-01" target="_blank">28-34-01</a></cite>. A hearing as provided for in this section is not a prerequisite to an appeal. If the obstruction is located in a road ditch, the timing and method of removal must be approved by the appropriate road authority before the notice required by this section is given and appropriate construction site protection standards must be followed.

   Where the landowner claimed that his farmland was damaged because neighbors failed to maintain a downstream watercourse, he failed to prove that the county water board was liable for dereliction of duty under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-21s61-21-43.1" target="_self">61-21-43.1</a></cite> by failing to order removal of the alleged obstruction. The board never determined that a drain had been obstructed by the negligent act or omission of a landowner; therefore, it was not required to send a notice to the neighbors.

     <p>
      The board may hold at any time and, upon petition of any affected landowner after a drain has been in existence for at least one year, shall hold a hearing for the purpose of determining the benefits of such drain to each tract of land affected. At least ten days’ notice of such hearing must be given by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the county and by mailing notice thereof to each owner of land whose assessment is proposed to be raised as determined by the records of the recorder or county treasurer. The provisions of this chapter governing the original determination of benefits and assessment of costs apply to any reassessment of benefits carried out under this section. The board may not be forced to make such reassessment more than once every ten years, nor may any assessment or balance thereof supporting a drainage fund be reduced or impaired by reassessment or otherwise as long as bonds payable out of such fund remain unpaid and moneys are not available in such fund to pay all such bonds in full, with interest.

     <p>
      If the cost of any work of cleaning out or repairing any drain, or system of legal drains, if more than one cleaning or repair project is carried on under one contract, does not exceed the amount provided for construction of a public improvement under section 48-01.2-02 in any one year, the work may be done on a day work basis or a contract may be let without being advertised. When the cost of such work exceeds the amount provided for construction of a public improvement under section 48-01.2-02 in any one year, a contract must be let in accordance with chapter 48-01.2. The competitive bid requirement is waived, upon the determination of the board that an emergency situation exists requiring the prompt repair of a project, and a contract may be made for the prompt repair of the project without seeking bids.

       Drain warrants — Terms and amounts.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Drain costs must be paid upon order of the board by warrants signed by the chairman and one other member of the board. The warrants are payable from the proper drain fund and, upon maturity, are receivable by the treasurer for drain assessments supporting the fund. The warrants may be issued at any time after the order establishing the drain has become final and after incurring liability to pay for drain work to be financed by drain assessments and in anticipation of levy and collection of the assessments. Every warrant not made payable on demand must specify the date when it becomes payable. Demand warrants not paid for want of funds must be registered by the county treasurer or, if the water resource district treasurer is custodian of the drain funds, the water resource district treasurer and bear interest at a rate determined by the board, not exceeding eight percent per annum. Warrants of specified maturities bear interest according to their provisions at a rate or rates resulting in an average net interest cost not exceeding twelve percent per annum if sold at private sale, and may be issued with interest coupons attached. There is no interest rate ceiling on warrants sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. All drain warrants must state upon their faces the purpose for which they are issued and the drain fund from which they are payable. The warrants may be used to pay drain obligations, or may be sold at not less than ninety-eight percent of par value, provided that the proceeds of warrants sold are placed in the proper drain fund and used exclusively for drain expenses. Any unpaid warrants issued for the acquisition of right of way or the construction of a drain, including all incidental costs in connection therewith, must be funded by a bond issue within one hundred eighty days from and after the filing of the assessment of all costs with the county auditor as provided in section 61-21-27, but this requirement may not be construed as prohibiting the funding of warrants or the issuance of bonds after the one hundred eighty-day period.

       Lien for and enforcement of drain assessments.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Drain costs determined by the board shall be extended upon the proper assessment list of benefited tracts in specific amounts computed according to the proportionate benefits found for each tract affected by the drain or by work done on the drain. A true copy of every such list affecting lands in a city shall be served on the auditor thereof promptly following completion. The assessment list shall then be filed in the office of the county auditor of the proper county or counties and said auditor shall extend upon the tax lists against the land affected the specific amounts of the drain assessments according to the drain assessment list prepared by the board. From and after the filing of a drain assessment list with the county auditor, the specific amounts levied and assessed against each benefited tract shall constitute a special tax thereon and shall be a lien upon such tract until fully paid. Such lien shall have precedence over all other liens except general tax liens, and shall be of equal rank and order with the lien of general taxes and shall not be divested by any judicial sale, tax sale, or foreclosure. This chapter shall be notice to all subsequent encumbrancers of the superior rank of drain liens imposed under the provisions hereof. Special drain taxes shall be collected and enforced as other taxes are collected and enforced and in the same manner as is provided in title 57. If no satisfaction of tax lien is made, the affected property shall pass absolutely to the board on foreclosure of tax lien provided the board pays the amount for satisfaction of lien, except the amounts of drain assessments, and may thereafter be sold by the board at public sale. The governing body of each city against which a drain assessment is made shall include in the earliest possible tax levy the amount assessed against it by the board, which amount shall be extended against all of the taxable property in such city as general taxes are extended, and such levy shall be over and above mill levy limitations prescribed by law. When the cost of any drain, or of an extension or enlargement or renovation thereof, shall be in such amount that the board finds that assessment of such total cost against the affected property for collection in full in a single payment would be unduly burdensome to such property, the board may determine to divide such cost into equal annual amounts to be assessed and collected over a period of not more than fifteen years. Drain costs and drain assessments shall include all expenditures for work and materials for the drain, including anticipated expenses, interest charges, and a reasonable charge for the establishment of a reserve fund with which the board may from time to time purchase tax delinquent property affected by the drain.

      The board may issue bonds to finance acquiring drain right of way, locating and constructing drains, and funding unpaid drain warrants heretofore issued, or issued hereafter under this chapter. Drain bonds issued in whole or in part to finance expenditures for which warrants have not been issued shall not be authorized until after firm contracts for projected drain work have been made and proper undertakings therefor have been executed and filed, or until after the drain work has been completed. Proceedings for the issuance of bonds shall be initiated by the adoption of a preliminary resolution of the board which shall include information and findings as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-21s61-21-53ol11">

      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      When such preliminary resolution has been duly adopted by the board, the board shall proceed to have the text thereof published in a legal newspaper of general circulation in the locality in which the particular drain is situated, and there shall be published with and as a part of such text a statement that from and after the expiration of thirty days next following the date of the first printing of such text, no action may be commenced or maintained, and no defense or counterclaim may be recognized in the courts of this state to question or impair the drain warrants resolved to be funded, or the drain assessments supporting such warrants. There shall also be included in such publication the further statement that a complete list identifying the drain warrants proposed to be funded has been filed in the office of the county auditor of the county or counties in which the affected lands are located. Such publication shall be made once each week for three successive weeks and proper proof thereof shall be filed with the board. The validity and enforceability of any drain warrant or of any assessment supporting the same shall not be vulnerable to attack in the courts of this state unless an appropriate action or proceeding is commenced or a defense or counterclaim is served within thirty days next following the date of first printing of such publication. The board shall prepare and file with the auditor of the proper county or counties a complete list identifying the drain warrants proposed to be funded by such bonds, and such list, or true copies thereof, shall be filed prior to the date of the first printing of said preliminary resolution. Within a reasonable time, and more than thirty days after the first printing of such preliminary resolution, the board may proceed to authorize the preparation and sale of drain bonds in accordance with such resolution. The bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates resulting in an average net interest cost not to exceed twelve percent per annum on those issues which are sold at private sale. There is no interest rate ceiling on those issues sold at public sale or to the state of North Dakota or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The bonds shall contain a provision that interest thereon shall cease at maturity unless the holder shall present the same for payment and payment is refused, shall designate the fund from which they are payable, and shall be offered for sale and sold as provided in chapter 21-03, for the offering and sale of general obligation bonds of governmental subdivisions of this state. Wherever drain bonds are issued for drain warrants, the bonds in the appropriate amount may be exchanged for the warrants, but the basis of exchange shall be such that the average net rate of interest on the bonds will not exceed the rate on the warrants refunded. Drain warrants purchased with the proceeds of bonds shall not be canceled but shall be retained by the board as assets of the drain fund from which the warrants are payable. The fund shall be continued and payments therefrom shall be made on the warrants drawn thereon without reference to the bond issue, but all such payments shall be placed in the fund from which the bonds are payable and shall be applied to service such bonds and to pay the interest thereon. Bonds issued by drainage districts shall be eligible for purchase by the various trust funds of the state of North Dakota and its instrumentalities.

If it appears to the county board that any drain does not have moneys and drain assessments receivable equal to one hundred percent of its obligations coming due within thirteen months next following, the county board shall pay from the county general fund into the sinking fund for drain warrants or bonds or shall proceed to levy a general property tax, the proceeds of which, together with drain moneys on hand and the probable prior yield of drain assessments will amount to one hundred ten percent of the obligations of the drain becoming due during the thirteen months next following. Such tax or payments shall be appropriated to the sinking fund for the drain warrants or bonds, and certificates of indebtedness may be issued against the same as levied. On redemption of all warrants or bonds against any sinking fund, or upon accumulation of moneys in such fund sufficient to redeem all outstanding warrants or bonds, all surplus moneys in such fund shall be payable to the general fund of the county or counties levying general property taxes or making such payments, up to the amounts of such levies or payments.

      The owners of property subject to fifty-one percent or more of the liability for maintaining any drain as determined in section 61-21-16 may petition the board for the abandonment and dissolution of such drain. Upon receipt of such petition, the board shall call a public hearing on the petition and if the board finds the number of valid signatures to represent property liable to fifty-one percent or more of the cost of upkeep of such drain, as determined by section 61-21-16, and that such drainage district has no outstanding indebtedness, the board shall then declare such drain to be abandoned and such drainage district to be dissolved, shall record such declaration upon the minutes and publish the same in a newspaper having wide circulation in that county, and shall return all unexpended assessments collected for the maintenance of the drain to the owners of the assessed property on a pro rata basis in proportion with the amount originally assessed. In case the drainage district extends into two or more counties, the board upon receipt of the petition above referred to shall convene in joint session and call the public meeting above provided. When a drain has been abandoned and dissolved, it may then be re-established in whole or in part only in the same way as a new drain is established.

       Board may apportion assessments for benefits of an established drain against a county or city or any tract of land benefited by an established drain.

     <p>
      Whenever a board discovers or ascertains that the county, a township, or city therein, or that any tract, parcel, or piece of land is being benefited by an established drain and that the county or such township, municipality, tract, piece, or parcel of land was not included in the drainage area assessed for the cost of construction and maintenance of the drain when established, the board shall commence proceedings for reassessment of lands originally assessed for the cost of establishing and constructing such drain and shall apportion and assess the part of the balance remaining unpaid, if any, of the cost of such drain, and the expense of maintenance thereof, which such county, township, or city and each tract of land found benefited thereby should bear.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before making such reassessment or reapportionment of benefits, the board shall hold a hearing for the purpose of determining the benefits of the drain to the county, such township, or city and to each tract, piece, or parcel of land being benefited. At least ten days’ notice of such hearing shall be given by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the county and by mailing notice thereof to each owner of land assessed for the cost of construction and maintenance when the drain was established and by mailing such notice to the governing board of the county, township, and municipality and to the owner of each tract, piece, or parcel of land found to be benefited since the establishment of the drain, as determined by the records in the office of the recorder or county treasurer. The provisions of this chapter governing the original determination of benefits and assessment of costs shall apply to the reassessment and assessment of benefits carried out under the provisions of this section.

   The former county water conservation and flood control district board of commissioners, and its successor, the county water resource board, are political subdivisions of the state, not administrative agencies with a limited time to correct orders, and this section clearly states that the water resource board may reapportion benefits and assessments whenever the board discovers or ascertains that land is benefited by an existing drain, and imposes no time limit upon the board.

      If the board determines that a drain, lateral drain, or ditch has been opened or established by a landowner or tenant contrary to this chapter or any rules adopted by the board, the board shall notify the landowner by registered mail at the landowner’s post office of record. A copy of the notice must also be sent to the tenant, if any. The notice must specify the nature and extent of the noncompliance and must state that if the drain, lateral drain, or ditch is not closed or filled within the period the board determines, but not less than fifteen days, the board shall procure the closing or filling of the drain, lateral drain, or ditch and assess the cost of the closing or filling, or the portion the board determines, against the property of the landowner responsible. The notice must also state that the affected landowner, within fifteen days of the date the notice is mailed, may demand in writing a hearing upon the matter. Upon receipt of the demand, the board shall set a hearing date within fifteen days from the date the demand is received. In the event of an emergency, the board may immediately apply to the appropriate district court for an injunction prohibiting the landowner or tenant from maintaining the drain, lateral drain, or ditch. Assessments levied under this section must be collected in the same manner as other assessments authorized by this chapter. If, in the opinion of the board, more than one landowner or tenant has been responsible, the costs may be assessed on a pro rata basis in accordance with the proportionate responsibility of the landowners. A landowner aggrieved by action of the board under this section may appeal the decision of the board to the district court of the county in which the land is located in accordance with the procedure provided for in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-34s28-34-01" target="_blank">28-34-01</a></cite>.

   Conservancy district’s decision to deny Barnes County petition to withdraw from the district because of its determination that Barnes County will be benefited by the establishment of the Garrison Diversion Unit was upheld on appeal to the supreme court where such decision was within the district’s jurisdiction, made pursuant to applicable law, not arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable, and supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Barnes County v. Garrison Diversion Conservancy Dist., 312 N.W.2d 20, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 402</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>

   It was error and an encroachment on the executive function by the judiciary where district court, on appeal of Garrison Diversion Conservancy District’s denial of county’s application to withdraw from the district, reheard the evidence and heard new evidence not heard by the conservancy district when a verbatim transcript of the proceedings before the conservancy district was available and unchallenged. Barnes County v. Garrison Diversion Conservancy Dist., 312 N.W.2d 20, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 402</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>

   On appeal of conservancy district’s decision from district court to the supreme court, the supreme court is not obligated to give due regard to the findings of fact made by the trial court; instead, supreme court performs essentially the same function as the district court, and is governed by the same scope of review.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds that adequate water supplies for municipal, domestic, livestock, rural, irrigation, industrial, and other uses are essential for the social stability and economic security of the people of the state of North Dakota. It is further found that the development and utilization of the water resources of this state are necessary for the protection of health, property, and enterprise, and for the promotion of prosperity and general welfare of the people of the state of North Dakota, and that such development and utilization of water resources in this state involves and requires the exercise of the sovereign powers of the state and concern a public purpose. It is necessary the southwest pipeline project, as authorized and approved pursuant to this chapter, be established and constructed, to provide for the supplementation of the water resources of a portion of the area of North Dakota south and west of the Missouri River with water supplies from the Missouri River for multiple purposes, including domestic, rural, and municipal uses. In furtherance of this public purpose, the state water commission may provide for the issuance of bonds not to exceed twenty-five million dollars in accordance with chapter 61-02 to finance the cost of the project. The provisions of this chapter may not be construed to abrogate or limit the rights, powers, duties, or functions of the state water commission or the department of water resources, but are supplementary to the rights, powers, duties, or functions. Nor may this chapter be construed as limiting or affecting the laws of this state relating to the organization or operation of irrigation districts, water resource districts, or other political subdivisions.

     <p>
      Any contracts for the purchase of pipeline materials, labor, or services awarded by the state water commission in regard to the construction of the southwest water pipeline project must be awarded to North Dakota resident pipeline manufacturers and North Dakota resident bidders for labor and services making the lowest responsible bids if those bids do not exceed by more than five percent the lowest responsible bid submitted by a nonresident pipeline manufacturer or bidder for labor or services. As used in this section, “North Dakota resident pipeline manufacturers and bidders for labor or services” means bidders or sellers who have maintained a bona fide place of business within this state for at least five years prior to the date on which the contract bid on is awarded. If the state water commission awards any contract for pipeline materials, labor, or services in regard to construction of the southwest water pipeline project to a nonresident bidder, the commission shall publicly give notice in a newspaper of general circulation regarding the specific reasons why it did not award the contract to a resident bidder. This section does not apply to contracts that involve federal moneys when a preference would be contrary to federal laws or regulations, contracts covered under chapter 48-01.2, or to architect, engineer, professional right of way, and land surveying services.

     <p>
      The extent and type of water treatment and the location of a water treatment plant or plants for the southwest pipeline project shall be determined by the commission, in accordance with law and as in the judgment of the commission the interests of the state and the water user entities of the southwest pipeline project are best served. In determining the location of the water treatment plant or plants, the commission may only consider alternatives that will provide treated water to all potential using entities at a cost not to exceed the cost of water from the single treatment facility originally provided for in the engineering preliminary design final report for the southwest pipeline project, state water commission project no. 1736, dated September 1982. Any existing water treatment facility that is to be used in the final pipeline design must be made available to the state in operable condition free of deferred maintenance costs and at a cost that does not exceed the actual depreciation, maintenance, and operation costs of that facility. A water treatment facility is in operable condition if, at the time it becomes part of the southwest pipeline project, it is meeting the needs of its current users. Capital improvements necessary for upgrading any existing water treatment facility to be used in the southwest pipeline project must be borne by the state water commission.

       Any county in the authority not benefited or not to be benefited, in whole or in part, by the southwest pipeline project, or any part thereof, may be excluded from the authority as provided herein. The board of county commissioners of any such county may by resolution direct the county auditor and the chairman of the board to file with the board of directors of the authority a petition, for and on behalf of the county, requesting the board of directors of the authority to exclude such county therefrom. A certified copy of the resolution of the county board must accompany and be filed with such petition. The petition and resolution must state specific reasons why such county will not be benefited by the southwest pipeline project, or any part thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-24.5s61-24.5-16ol12">
       Within sixty days from the date of filing said resolution and petition for exclusion from the authority, the authority board shall meet to consider such petition. It may grant such petition or it may fix a time and place for a hearing thereon. If a hearing is set, the secretary of the board shall cause notice of the filing of such petition for exclusion, and of the time and place for a hearing, to be published once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation printed within the authority. The hearing mentioned in such notice must be held not less than ten nor more than twenty days after the last publication of such notice. The notice must state that any person, corporation, limited liability company, municipality, and county in the authority may appear or be represented at the hearing and show cause why the petition should or should not be granted. The board shall hear the petition at the time and place mentioned in the notice.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-24.5s61-24.5-16ol13">
       If after the hearing on the petition the authority board of directors shall determine that the county requesting to be excluded from the authority will not be benefited, the authority board shall by resolution grant the petition and shall direct the chairman and secretary to execute the order of the board excluding such county from the authority. If, however, the authority board shall decide that such county will be benefited, it shall deny the petition and direct the chairman and secretary to execute its order refusing to exclude such county from the authority. A county excluded from the authority is not liable for any obligations thereof incurred after exclusion but is liable for and shall pay to the authority taxes levied before exclusion.

       If any contract has been made with the United States or any agency thereof, or the state of North Dakota or any agency thereof, before such petition is filed, such petition may not be granted unless consented thereto by the appropriate agency of the United States or North Dakota, and if such agency gives its consent upon condition, such conditions must be included in the order of exclusion and the county may be required to, and in that event such county shall continue to, pay and satisfy any obligations under any such contract.

     <p>
      Many areas and localities in northwestern North Dakota do not enjoy safe drinking water, and the water in these areas and localities contains iron, sulfates, alkali, salt, nitrates, fluoride, and other hazardous and discoloring substances. Other areas and localities in northwestern North Dakota do not have sufficient quantities of water to ensure a dependable, long-term supply. Supplementation of the water resources of northwestern North Dakota with water supplies from the Missouri River, utilizing a pipeline transmission and delivery system, may be the only alternative to provide northwestern North Dakota with a safe, good quality, dependable source, and adequate quantity of water.
     </p>
     <p>
      Effective development and utilization of the land and water resources of this state; the opportunity for greater economic security; the protection of health, property, enterprise, and the preservation of the benefits from the land and water resources of this state; and the promotion of the prosperity and general welfare of all of the people of North Dakota involve and require the exercise of the sovereign powers of the state and concern a public purpose. To accomplish this public purpose, a project to supply and distribute water to the people of northwestern North Dakota through a pipeline transmission and delivery system for purposes, including domestic, rural water districts, municipal, livestock, light industrial, mining, and other uses, with primary emphasis on domestic, rural water district, and municipal uses must be pursued. In furtherance of this public purpose, the state water commission may provide for the issuance of bonds in accordance with chapter 61-02 to finance the costs of the project.
     </p>
     <p>
      This chapter may not be construed to limit the rights, powers, duties, and functions of the state water commission or the department of water resources, but must be considered supplementary to those rights, powers, duties, and functions.

      The legislative assembly finds that the provision of water of sufficient quantity and quality to supply homes, businesses, industries, wildlife, and recreation in the Red River valley within this state is necessary for the protection of health, property, and enterprises and for the promotion of prosperity and the general welfare of the people of the Red River valley and that construction of the Red River valley water supply project involves and requires the exercise of the sovereign powers of the state and concerns a public purpose. Therefore, it is declared necessary and in the public interest that the state by and through the state water commission provide a share of the cost of constructing the Red River valley water supply project.

       Condemnation of land and rights of way for special improvements — Taking of possession — Trial — Appeal — Vacation of judgment.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When property required to make any improvement authorized by this chapter is to be taken by condemnation proceedings, the court, upon request by resolution of the board of the district making the improvement, shall call a special term of court for the trial of the proceedings and may summon a jury for the trial. The proceedings must be instituted and prosecuted in accordance with chapter 32-15, except that when the interest sought to be acquired is a right of way for the laying of any main, pipe, ditch, canal, aqueduct, or flume for conducting water, whether within or without the district, the district may make an offer to purchase the right of way and may deposit the amount of the offer with the clerk of the district court of the county in which the right of way is located, and may then take possession of the right of way. The offer must be made by resolution of the board of the district, and a copy of the resolution must be attached to the complaint filed with the clerk of court in accordance with section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-15s32-15-18" target="_blank">32-15-18</a></cite>. The clerk shall immediately notify the owners of the land on which the right of way is located of the deposit by causing a notice to be appended to the summons when served and published in the proceedings as provided in the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure stating the amount deposited or agreed in the resolution to be deposited. The owner may then appeal to the court by filing an answer to the complaint in the manner provided in the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure and may have a jury trial, unless a jury is waived, to determine the damages. However, upon due proof of the service of the notice and summons and upon deposit of the aggregate sum agreed in the resolution, the court without further notice may make and enter an order as authorized by section 16 of article I of the Constitution of North Dakota. If under laws of the United States proceedings for the acquisition of any right of way are required to be instituted in or removed to a federal court, the proceedings may be taken in that court in the same manner and with the same effect as provided in this section and the clerk of the district court of the county in which the right of way is located shall perform any and all of the duties set forth in this section if the clerk is directed to do so by the federal court. The proceedings must be determined as speedily as practicable. An appeal from a judgment in the condemnation proceedings must be taken within sixty days after the entry of the judgment and appeal must be given preference by the supreme court over all other civil cases except election contests. No final judgment in the condemnation proceedings awarding damages to property used by the district for irrigation or other purposes may be vacated or set aside if the district pays to the defendant, or into court for the defendant, the amount awarded in cash. The district may levy special assessments within the district to pay all or part of the judgment. To provide funds for the payment of the judgment or for the deposit of the amount offered for purchase of a right of way, the district may issue bonds on the fund of the improvement district as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-24.8s61-24.8-09" target="_self">61-24.8-09</a></cite> in anticipation of the levy and collection of special assessments or revenues to be appropriated to the fund in accordance with this chapter. The bonds may be issued upon or after the commencement of the condemnation proceedings. Upon the failure of the district to make payment in accordance with this section, the judgment in the condemnation proceedings may be vacated.

      Any improvement district created by the district may embrace two or more separate property areas. Each improvement district must be of such size and form as to include all properties, which in the judgment of the board, after consultation with the engineer planning the improvement, will be benefited by the construction of the improvement project which is proposed to be made in or for the district, or by any portion of the project. A single district may be created for an improvement of the type specified in section 61-24.8-07, notwithstanding any lack of uniformity among the types, items, or quantities of work and materials to be used at particular locations throughout the improvement district. The jurisdiction of the district to make, finance, and assess the cost of any improvement project may not be impaired by any lack of commonness, unity, or singleness of the location, purpose, or character of the improvement, or by the fact that any one or more of the properties included in the improvement district is subsequently determined not to be benefited by the improvement, or by a particular portion of the improvement project, and is not assessed for that purpose. The board may omit from an improvement district property within the improvement district limits. The board may by resolution enlarge an improvement district in which an improvement is proposed, under construction, or in existence upon receipt of a petition signed by the owners of all of the area to be added to the district.

      At the hearing or in the written notice, the affected landowners must be informed when and where votes concerning the proposed project may be filed. Affected landowners to be assessed have thirty days after the date of the hearing or thirty days after the date of mailing the notice to file their votes with the secretary of the district.

      In order that there may be a fair relationship between the amount of liability for assessments and the power of objecting to the establishment of a proposed project, the voting rights of affected landowners on the question of establishing the project are as provided in this section. The landowner of land affected by the project has one vote for each dollar of assessment to which the land is subject or one vote for each dollar of the assessed valuation of land for which fee title interest will be lost as a result of the project. There may be only one vote for each dollar of assessment, regardless of the number of owners of a tract of land. If more than one owner of a tract of land exists, the votes must be prorated among them in accordance with each owner’s property interest. A written power of attorney authorizes an agent to protest a project on behalf of any affected landowner or landowners.

Property belonging to the United States is exempt from assessment unless the United States has provided for the payment of any assessment that may be levied against its property for benefits received. There must be attached to the list of assessments a certificate signed by the chairman and certified by the secretary that it is a true and correct assessment of the benefit described to the best of their judgment and stating the several items of expense included in the assessment.

The publication must include a notice of the time and place the board will meet to hear objections to any assessment by any interested party or an agent or attorney for that party. Publication of the assessment list is not required if the board mails the assessment list and the time and place of the hearing to each affected landowner. The date set for the hearing must be not less than fourteen days after the mailing or first publication of the notice. At the hearing, the board may make such alterations in the assessments as in its opinion may be just and necessary to correct any error in the assessment but must make the aggregate of all assessments equal to the total amount required to pay the entire cost of the work for which the assessments are made or the part of the cost to be paid by special assessment. An assessment may not exceed the benefit as determined by the board to the parcel of land assessed. The hearing is not required if the board receives written consent from each affected landowner to the levy of assessments. The board then shall confirm the assessment list and the secretary shall attach to the list a certificate that it is correct as confirmed by the board.

      A special assessment imposed by the district, with accrued interest and penalties, is a lien upon the property on which the assessment is levied from the time the assessment list is approved by the board until the assessment is fully paid. The liens have precedence over all other liens except general tax liens and may not be divested by any judicial sale. Mistake in the description of the property covered by the special assessment lien or in the name of the owner of such property does not defeat the lien if the assessed property can be identified by the description in the assessment list. This chapter must be considered notice to all subsequent encumbrances of the priority of special assessments imposed under this chapter.

       Irrigation improvements in districts — Paid by service charges.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The district constructing an irrigation improvement under the special assessment method may resolve in the resolution required by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-24.8s61-24.8-07" target="_self">61-24.8-07</a></cite> that a portion of the cost of the improvement must be raised by service charges for the use of the improvement and of the utility of which it forms a part. If the district so resolves, it may determine in its resolutions, and other proceedings relating to the levying of special assessments and the issuing of bonds to pay the cost of such improvement that a specified portion or all of such special assessments may be reduced each year by the amount of revenues on deposit in the fund required by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-24.8s61-24.8-36" target="_self">61-24.8-36</a></cite>. All of the applicable provisions of this chapter relating to special assessments are applicable to such improvements except as to the portion of the cost of improvements resolved or ordained to be paid by service charges. The board of the district shall provide for the establishment, imposition, and collection of service charges for the services furnished by the improvement and the utility of which it forms a part, and in that connection it has all the rights and powers respecting such service charges as it would have with respect to like matters if the improvement were made in accordance with sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-24s61-24-22" target="_self">61-24-22</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-24s61-24-32" target="_self">61-24-32</a></cite>. The net revenues derived from the imposition and collection of the service charges or any portion of the service charges as are determined by the board in the resolutions and ordinances must be paid into the appropriate improvement district funds created under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-24.8s61-24.8-36" target="_self">61-24.8-36</a></cite>. The revenues when collected must be used and applied in the same manner as moneys paid into such funds from the collection of special assessments. The board in issuing bonds to finance any such improvement in its resolutions may establish an assessment reserve in the fund of the improvement district, to which it may appropriate net revenues of the utility or system from time to time received in excess of amounts required, with special assessments then on hand, to meet the principal and interest next due on the bonds. Before November first of any year, the district may by resolution determine the proportion which the amount then on hand in the assessment reserve, and irrevocably appropriated to the payment of the bond, bears to the aggregate amount of the installment of the special assessments levied for the improvement which is payable in the following year, including interest. The district may direct the auditor to reduce, by not more than a proportionate amount, the total of that installment and interest which would otherwise be placed upon the tax list of the improvement district for the current year against each lot and tract of land assessed or taxed for improvement. If the installment of the special assessment on any property has been prepaid, the board may direct the district to refund, out of the assessment reserve, to the owner of the property at the time of the refund as indicated in the records of the recorder of the county a sum not exceeding a similar proportion of the principal amount of such installment excluding interest.

      When the board, by resolution, has caused special assessments to be levied to cover the cost of constructing a project the board shall determine the rate of interest unpaid special assessments are to bear, which rate may not exceed one and one-half percent above the bond rate. Interest on unpaid special assessments commences on the date the assessments are finally confirmed by the board. Special assessments may be certified and made payable in equal annual installments, the last of which must be due and payable not more than thirty years after the date of the bonds to be paid. The secretary of the district shall certify to the county auditor of the county in which the improvement district is situated, or if the improvement district embraces more than one county to the county auditor of each county in which improvement district lands subject to such special assessments are situated, the total amount assessed against each piece, parcel, lot, or tract of land. The secretary of the district also shall file with the county auditor of each county in which district lands lie a statement showing the cost of the project and the part of the project to be financed by special assessments. Funds needed to pay the cost of maintaining a project may be raised in the same manner as funds were raised to meet construction costs. If the project was financed in whole or in part through the use of special assessments, the board shall prorate the cost of construction. The district treasurer annually shall certify to the county auditor all uncertified installments of assessments which are to be extended upon the tax lists of the improvement district for the current year, in the manner provided in this section. The annual certification must continue until the amount of moneys on deposit in the fund established under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-24.8s61-24.8-36" target="_self">61-24.8-36</a></cite> is sufficient to cover outstanding principal of and interest on any obligations issued to fund the projects, and in addition, to repay the district for any payments made by the district to fund deficiencies in the fund established under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-24.8s61-24.8-36" target="_self">61-24.8-36</a></cite>.

Special assessments are not subject to abatement or refund by proceedings under chapter 57-32 but may be reviewed and corrected only in the manner and upon the conditions provided in chapter 40-26. The county treasurer, at the time set by law for the payment to the district treasurer of all the taxes and special assessments collected during the preceding month, shall certify the amounts of special assessments collected. The certificate must state specifically the lot or known subdivision as it appears on the tax books of the county treasurer; the block, addition, amount collected, and amount credited to each lot or known subdivision; and the year for which the sum was collected.

        Purpose of Chapter.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   This chapter was enacted to give the state the power to control, prevent, and abate the pollution of surface waters in the state. It gives to the state through its water pollution control board, acting jointly with the state health council, the authority to adopt, amend, or repeal rules, regulations, and standards of quality of the waters of the state, and it fixes penalties for the violation thereof. It does not give to the state ownership sufficient to support a civil action for damages against one who unlawfully pollutes a stream and thus causes the destruction of fish while they are running wild in such water.

        Hearings.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   In a dispute regarding the issuance of a North Dakota Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, the North Dakota Department of Health complied with the permitting process because, under former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.23.html#t23c23-01s23-01-23" target="_blank">23-01-23</a></cite>, the hearings conducted were not adjudicative proceedings. Further, an arbitrary and capricious standard of review was applicable because there was not an adjudicative proceeding, and the general standard of review of agency’s findings for adjudicative proceedings under

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_blank">28-32-46</a></cite> was incompatible with the procedural posture of the case. The Health Department’s decision was entitled to even greater deference than a proceeding after an adjudicative proceeding, and the Health Department’s permitting decision was thus reviewed to determine whether it was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, particularly in light of the fact that the subject matter was complex or technical and involved agency expertise.

   North Dakota Department of Health did not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably in deciding that an antidegradation review was not required to modify the permit for the Devils Lake outlet, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-28s61-28-06" target="_self">61-28-06</a></cite>; there was cause to modify a sulfate limitation in the initial permit and sulfate limits involved a technical area in which the Health Department’s decision was entitled to deference. However, modifications to the TSS (total suspended solids) standard and the period of operation for the permit were arbitrary and capricious as they were based on a change of view following new information and were not corrections of technical errors.

The permit fees must be based on the anticipated cost of filing and processing the application, reviewing plans and specifications relating to the construction, modification, or operation of disposal systems, and taking action on the requested permit and conducting a monitoring and inspection program to determine compliance or noncompliance with the permit. Any moneys collected for permit fees must be deposited in the department operating fund in the state treasury and any expenditure from the fund is subject to appropriation by the legislative assembly.

     <p>
      Any proceeding under this chapter for issuance or modification of rules, including emergency orders relating to control of water pollution or for determining compliance with or violation of this chapter, or adoption of any rule or order under this chapter by the department, must be conducted in accordance with chapter 28-32. Any person claiming to be aggrieved or adversely affected by actions taken, or by any rule or order issued under this chapter may request a hearing by the department. There is a right of appeal to the district court from any adverse ruling by the department. Where an emergency exists requiring immediate action to protect the quality of water for legitimate uses and the public health and welfare, the department, without further notice or hearing, may issue an order reciting the existence of the emergency and requiring that such immediate action be taken as is necessary to meet this emergency. Notwithstanding this chapter, the order is effective immediately. Any person to whom the order is directed shall comply immediately, but on application to the department must be afforded a hearing before the department within ten days. On the basis of that hearing, the emergency order must be continued, modified, or revoked within thirty days after the hearing. In the alternative, upon receipt of evidence that a pollution source or combination of sources is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons or to the welfare of persons where the endangerment to welfare is to the livelihood of those persons, or upon receipt of evidence that pollution causes or threatens to cause a continuing violation of water quality standards in a manner that substantially interferes with or causes long-term or irreparable harm to waters of this state that the department determines has statewide or regional significance or has a substantial impact to a local community, the department may bring suit on behalf of the state in the district court for the county in which the violation is taking place to immediately restrain any person causing or contributing to the alleged pollution to stop the discharge of pollutants causing or contributing to the pollution, or to otherwise enjoin any pollution causing a substantial water quality violation as described in this section, or to take such other action as may be necessary.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly declares it to be the policy of this state that safe supplies of drinking water are essential to the maintenance of public health and welfare. Those persons supplied with water from public water systems must be able to rely with confidence upon the quality of water publicly used for human consumption. Those persons served by public water systems are entitled to regulation of those systems so that they may purchase healthful water, free of harmful contaminants. It is the intention of the legislative assembly that these policies will be fulfilled by the state in accordance with the terms of this chapter and consistent with the provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.

       Drinking water treatment revolving loan fund — Purposes — Establishment.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      To coordinate funding for public water systems in North Dakota, there is established a drinking water treatment revolving loan fund to be administered by the department. The loan fund is also authorized under section 1452(a) of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, as amended. Grants from the federal government or its agencies, including the United States environmental protection agency, allotted to the state for the capitalization of the drinking water treatment revolving loan fund, and required state matching funds must be deposited in the drinking water treatment revolving loan fund in compliance with the terms of the grants. The principal of the grants must be available in perpetuity for providing financial assistance as allowed under the Safe Drinking Water Act. To the extent amounts in the revolving loan fund are not required for current obligations or expenditures, these amounts must be invested in interest-bearing obligations.

       Permit to drain waters required — Penalty.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person, before draining a pond, slough, lake, or sheetwater, or any series thereof, which has a watershed area comprising eighty acres [32.37 hectares] or more, shall first secure a permit to do so. The permit application must be submitted to the department of water resources. The department shall refer the application to the water resource district or districts within which is found a majority of the watershed or drainage area of the pond, slough, lake, or sheetwater for consideration and approval, but the department may require applications proposing drainage of statewide or interdistrict significance be returned to the department for final approval. A permit may not be granted until an investigation discloses the quantity of water which will be drained from the pond, slough, lake, or sheetwater, or any series of those water bodies, will not flood or adversely affect downstream lands. If the investigation shows the proposed drainage will flood or adversely affect lands of downstream landowners, the water resource board may not issue a permit until flowage easements are obtained. The flowage easements must be filed for record in the office of the recorder of the county or counties in which the lands are situated. An owner of land proposing to drain shall undertake and agree to pay the expenses incurred in making the required investigation. This section does not apply to the construction or maintenance of any existing or prospective drain constructed under the supervision of a state or federal agency, as determined by the department of water resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person draining, or causing to be drained, a pond, slough, lake, or sheetwater, or any series of those water bodies, which has a watershed area comprising eighty acres [32.37 hectares] or more, without first securing a permit to do so, as provided by this section, is liable for all damage sustained by any person caused by the draining, and is guilty of an infraction. As used in this section, sheetwater means shallow water that floods land not normally subject to standing water. The department of water resources may adopt rules for temporary permits for emergency drainage.

   The wildlife society’s constitutional rights to a fair hearing on its opposition to the issuance of a permit for a drainage project were not disregarded merely because the state engineer performed differing functions during the course of the drainage application process. In re Application for Permits to Drain Related to Stone Creek Channel Improv. etc., 424 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   Defendant did not introduce evidence at trial that would have given the trial court a reasonable basis to apportion the damages among various causes. Therefore, his assertion on appeal that liability “should have been limited to a small percentage of the total damages” was insufficient, and the trial court did not err in holding defendant liable for one hundred percent of the damages. Lang v. Wonnenberg, 455 N.W.2d 832, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>

   The state engineer’s analysis of the burden of proof was not a fatal procedural error regardless of whether he properly placed the beginning burden of going forward with evidence on drainage project opponents, since both opponents and proponents submitted evidence about the effect of the project on water quality, and the state engineer did not place the ultimate burden of persuasion upon opponents, but placed it upon the proponents. In re Application for Permits to Drain Related to Stone Creek Channel Improv. etc., 424 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>

   Neither the statutes nor the regulations specify that the state engineer must consider the cumulative impact of a current project and possible future projects, since requiring the state engineer to study and evaluate all possible contingencies, however remote, would not be feasible or practical. In re Application for Permits to Drain Related to Stone Creek Channel Improv. etc., 424 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Federal agency’s involvement in drainage project amounted to more than technical assistance and constituted supervision of project, and thus no permit was required under this section, where involvement included: determining feasibility of draining land; preparing drain design; having proposed drainage system reviewed by agency’s area engineer; determining effects of drain on downstream landowners; staking location and grade of drain; overseeing construction of project; and examining completed project for conformity to design specifications. In re Persons, 334 N.W.2d 471, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1983).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Whether a particular pronouncement is a finding of fact or a conclusion of law will be determined by the reviewing court, and labels are not conclusive, therefore, the state engineer’s “conclusion” about the project’s impact on water quality was a finding of fact and was amply supported by evidence. In re Application for Permits to Drain Related to Stone Creek Channel Improv. etc., 424 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       </h5>
       <p>

   The state engineer’s relationship with water resource boards, the state engineer’s deviation from the hearing officer’s recommendation, and the “tone and tenor” of the cross examination of witnesses by the state engineer’s legal counsel during the hearing did not reveal a bias against drainage opponents which precluded fair and impartial consideration of drainage applications. In re Application for Permits to Drain Related to Stone Creek Channel Improv. etc., 424 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   The state engineer’s interpretation of “overriding circumstances” justifying drainage of certain wetlands was not contrary to law, where the state engineer determined that the drainage project under consideration would not be effective unless the drain traveled along five type IV wetlands, and that the remaining ten of the wetlands were underlain by “prime farmland.” In re Application for Permits to Drain Related to Stone Creek Channel Improv. etc., 424 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       </h5>
       <p>

   There was no violation of public trust responsibilities by the state engineer, where the permits for and possible consequences of the improvements and drain had been studied and debated by opponents and proponents for nearly a decade, the state engineer’s decision contained a detailed analysis of the evidence, discussed the potential impacts of the project, and concluded that the drain should be permitted subject to various conditions, some wetlands in the drainage area must be retained at their natural level while others could be drained, and the project and operation plan were subject to future modifications or conditions by the state engineer to protect the public interest.

       Only a landowner experiencing flooding or adverse effects from an unauthorized drain constructed before January 1, 1975, may file a complaint with the water resource board. Any person may file a complaint about an unauthorized drain constructed after January 1, 1975. Upon receipt of a complaint of unauthorized drainage, the water resource board shall promptly investigate and make a determination of the facts with respect to the complaint. If the board determines that a drain, lateral drain, or ditch has been opened or established by a landowner or tenant contrary to this title or any rules adopted by the board, the board shall notify the landowner by certified mail at the landowner’s post-office address of record. A copy of the notice must also be sent to the tenant, if known. The notice must specify the nature and extent of the noncompliance and must state that if the drain, lateral drain, or ditch is not closed or filled within a reasonable time as the board determines, but not less than fifteen days, the board shall procure the closing or filling of the drain, lateral drain, or ditch and assess the cost of the closing or filling, or the portion the board determines, against the property of the landowner responsible. The notice must also state that the affected landowner, within fifteen days of the date the notice is mailed, may demand, in writing, a hearing on the matter. Upon receipt of the demand, the board shall set a hearing date within fifteen days from the date the demand is received.

      The department of water resources shall maintain ordinary high water mark delineation guidelines consistent with this section.

     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-33s61-33-01.1ol11">
       When determining the ordinary high water mark for delineating the boundary of sovereign lands, vegetation and soils analysis must be considered the primary physical indicators. When considering vegetation, the ordinary high water mark is the line below which the presence and action of the water is frequent enough to prevent the growth of terrestrial vegetation or restrict vegetation growth to predominately aquatic species. Generally, land, including hay land, where the high and continuous presence of water has destroyed the value of the land for agricultural purposes must be deemed within the ordinary high water mark.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-33s61-33-01.1ol12">
       When feasible, direct hydrological and hydraulic measurements from stream gauge data, elevation data, historic records of water flow, high resolution light detection and ranging systems, prior elevation and survey maps, and statistical hydrological evidence must be considered when determining the ordinary high water mark. The department of water resources shall establish appropriate guidelines, technical standards, and other criteria, including use of light detection and ranging systems or other future technological advancements, as necessary, for conducting hydrologic and hydraulic modeling required by this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-33s61-33-01.1ol13">
       Secondary physical indicators, including litter, debris, or staining, may be considered to supplement the analysis of the ordinary high water mark investigation but may not supersede primary physical indicators unless primary physical indicators are deemed inadequate or inconclusive. Physical indicators directly affected by influent non-navigable tributaries, adjoining water bodies, or wetlands may not be used to delineate the sovereign land boundary of a navigable body of water.

      There is created a sovereign lands advisory board. The board’s responsibility is to advise the department of water resources and the board of university and school lands on general policies as well as specific projects, programs, and uses regarding sovereign lands. The board, being solely advisory, has no authority to require the department of water resources or the board of university and school lands to implement or otherwise accept the board’s recommendations.

       Mineral ownership of land subject to inundation by Pick-Sloan Missouri basin project dams. [Retroactive application — See note]

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state sovereign land mineral ownership of the riverbed segments subject to inundation by Pick-Sloan Missouri basin project dams extends only to the historical Missouri riverbed channel up to the ordinary high water mark. The state holds no claim or title to any minerals above the ordinary high water mark of the historical Missouri riverbed channel subject to inundation by Pick-Sloan Missouri basin project dams, except for original grant lands acquired by the state under federal law and any minerals acquired by the state through purchase, foreclosure, or other written conveyance. Mineral ownership of the riverbed segments subject to inundation by Pick-Sloan Missouri basin project dams which are located within the exterior boundaries of the Fort Berthold reservation and Standing Rock Indian reservation is controlled by other law and is excepted from this section.

      Applicants with livestock water supply problems caused by drought may apply for assistance from the program. An applicant must first apply for water cost-share assistance from the United States department of agriculture farm service agency. If cost-share assistance is denied by the agency, the applicant may forward the application to the commission for consideration. An application forwarded to the commission must include a document from the United States department of agriculture farm service agency stating the reason for denial of cost-share assistance. The department of water resources shall review all applications received by the commission. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a water supply project commenced after application for funding is made but without prior approval of the department is eligible for funding consideration from the program. The department shall provide funds for approved applications in accordance with rules and criteria for eligibility and only to the extent that funding is available. A drought disaster livestock water assistance program project located on Indian land is eligible for the program.

       Conversion of water resource district water supply system to water district.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A water resource district that has developed a water supply system under chapter 61-16.1 may convert that system to a water district as provided in this section. The water resource district board operating a water supply system may petition the department of water resources to organize a district in the manner provided by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-02" target="_self">61-35-02</a></cite>. The signatures of the water resource district’s board of directors on the petition and a resolution adopted by the water supply system’s users approving the petition suffice in lieu of signatures of owners of fifty percent of the real property in the proposed district, if the petition presenter provides evidence satisfactory to the department that a sufficient number of members of the proposed district will subscribe or have subscribed to benefit units to make its operation feasible. The procedure for hearing and determination of disposition of the petition is as provided by this chapter. In any district organized upon the petition of a water resource board of directors, the following procedures apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-02.1ol11">
       After final approval of the petition by the department of water resources, the secretary of the water resource board shall file a notice with the secretary of state.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-02.1ol12">
       Upon filing of the notice, the assets and liabilities of the water supply system become the assets and liabilities of the newly organized district without any further meetings, voting, notice to creditors, or other actions by the members of the board.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-02.1ol13">
       The officers and board of directors of the water resource district are the officers and board of the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-02.1ol14">
       The applicable laws of the state governing the water resource district board control the initial size and the initial terms of office of officers and the board, in lieu of sections 61-35-08 through 61-35-11.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-02.1ol15">
       The district shall bring its operation and structure into compliance with the requirements of section 61-35-08 regarding the number and qualification of directors, section 61-35-09 regarding new bylaws, section 61-35-10 regarding dividing its directors into classes, and section 61-35-11 regarding board meetings at the first annual meeting of the participating members and board. The new district has all the rights and all the property of the original water supply system and is responsible for all its obligations. Title to any property is vested in the new district with no reversion or impairment of ownership rights caused by the conversion to a district. A water supply agreement entered by a water resource district is binding for its term on a successor district organized by the water resource district, unless otherwise agreed in writing by all parties to the agreement. The right of any creditor may not be impaired by this section without the creditor’s consent.

The signatures of the corporation’s or cooperative’s officers on the petition and a resolution adopted by the members in the manner provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.10.html#t10c10-15s10-15-37" target="_blank">10-15-37</a></cite> for amendments to articles or in the manner provided in chapter 10-33 for dissolution approving the petition suffice in lieu of signatures of owners of fifty percent of the real property in the proposed district, if the petition presenter provides evidence satisfactory to the department that a sufficient number of members of the proposed district will subscribe or have subscribed to benefit units to make its operation feasible. The procedure for hearing and determination of disposition of the petition is as provided by this chapter. In any district organized upon the petition of a nonprofit corporation or cooperative association, the following procedures apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-25ol11">

       Upon filing of the notice, the nonprofit corporation or cooperative ceases to exist as a title 10 entity and all assets and liabilities of the nonprofit corporation or cooperative become the assets and liabilities of the newly organized district without any further meetings, voting, notice to creditors, or other actions by the members of the board.

The new district has all the rights and all the property of the original corporation or cooperative and is responsible for all its obligations. Title to any property is vested in the new district with no reversion or impairment of ownership rights caused by the conversion to a district. A water supply agreement entered by a nonprofit corporation or cooperative association is binding for its term on a successor district organized by the nonprofit corporation or cooperative association, unless otherwise agreed in writing by all parties to the agreement. The right of any creditor may not be impaired by this section without the creditor’s consent.

      Revenue bonds or refunding bonds must be sold at not less than ninety-eight percent of par.

Bonds sold at private sale must bear interest at a rate and be sold at a price resulting in an average net interest cost not exceeding twelve percent per annum. There is no interest rate ceiling on issues sold at public sale or to the state or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. As to any series or issue of bonds for which a notice of sale was published but for which no bids were received or all bids received were rejected, the board, without readvertising the bonds for sale, may negotiate the sale of all of the bonds to any person upon terms complying with those specified in the published notice of sale and, if bids were rejected, more favorable to the district than those specified in the rejected bid.

      Upon complying with this chapter, a district may defray the expense of any or all of the improvements by special assessments, including the construction of all or part of a water supply system or a sewerage system, or both, or any improvement, extension, or replacement of such systems, including the construction and erection of wells, intakes, pumping stations, settling basins, filtration plants, standpipes, water towers, reservoirs, water mains, sanitary and storm sewer mains and outlets, facilities for the treatment and disposal of sewage and other district, industrial, and domestic wastes, and all other appurtenances, contrivances, and structures used or useful for a complete water supply and sewerage system. In planning an improvement project, the board may include in the plans any and all items of work and materials which in its judgment are necessary or reasonably incidental to the completion of an improvement project of that type.

      When it is necessary to conduct the sewage of a district or to acquire a supply of water beyond the district limits and to construct mains or aqueducts to conduct water or sewage to the district limits, the board by grant, purchase, or condemnation proceedings may acquire private property over which to construct the sewer, or upon and over which to establish facilities for obtaining and storing such water supply and aqueducts or mains for conducting water to the corporate limits. Public property may be acquired for those purposes by grant or purchase from the government or public corporation owning the property. The cost of acquiring such property and building such sewer or other facilities upon or over the property may be included in the cost of construction or acquisition of a district waterworks or sewerage system and in the district’s special assessments levied, or the entirety of such a project may be completed as an improvement to an existing waterworks or sewage system and special assessments may be levied for that purpose in accordance with the provisions of this title.

       Condemnation of land and rights of way for special improvements — Taking of possession — Trial — Appeal — Vacation of judgment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When property required to make any improvement authorized by this chapter is to be taken by condemnation proceedings, the court, upon request by resolution of the board of the district making the improvement, shall call a special term of court for the trial of the proceedings and may summon a jury for the trial. The proceedings must be instituted and prosecuted in accordance with chapter 32-15, except that when the interest sought to be acquired is a right of way for the laying of any main, pipe, ditch, canal, aqueduct, or flume for conducting water, storm water, or sewage, whether within or without the district, the district may make an offer to purchase the right of way and may deposit the amount of the offer with the clerk of the district court of the county in which the right of way is located, and may then take possession of the right of way. The offer must be made by resolution of the board of the district, and a copy of the resolution must be attached to the complaint filed with the clerk of court in accordance with section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-15s32-15-18" target="_blank">32-15-18</a></cite>. The clerk shall immediately notify the owners of the land on which the right of way is located of the deposit by causing a notice to be appended to the summons when served and published in the proceedings as provided in the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure, stating the amount deposited or agreed in the resolution to be deposited. The owner may then appeal to the court by filing an answer to the complaint in the manner provided in the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure, and may have a jury trial, unless a jury is waived, to determine the damages. However, upon due proof of the service of the notice and summons and upon deposit of the aggregate sum agreed in the resolution, the court may without further notice make and enter an order determining the district to be entitled to take immediate possession of the right of way. If under laws of the United States proceedings for the acquisition of any right of way are required to be instituted in or removed to a federal court, the proceedings may be taken in that court in the same manner and with the same effect as provided in this section and the clerk of the district court of the county in which the right of way is located shall perform any and all of the duties set forth in this section, if the clerk is directed to do so by the federal court. The proceedings must be determined as speedily as practicable. An appeal from a judgment in the condemnation proceedings must be taken within sixty days after the entry of the judgment and appeal must be given preference by the supreme court over all other civil cases except election contests. No final judgment in the condemnation proceedings awarding damages to property used by a district for sewer or other purposes may be vacated or set aside if the district pays to the defendant, or into court for the defendant, the amount awarded in cash. The district may levy special assessments within the district to pay all or part of the judgment. To provide funds for the payment of the judgment or for the deposit of the amount offered for purchase of a right of way, the district may issue bonds on the fund of the improvement district as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-84" target="_self">61-35-84</a></cite>, in anticipation of the levy and collection of special assessments or revenues to be appropriated to the fund in accordance with this chapter. The bonds may be issued upon or after the commencement of the condemnation proceedings. Upon the failure of the district to make payment in accordance with this section, the judgment in the condemnation proceedings may be vacated.

     <p>
      For an improvement project under section 61-35-48 and defraying the cost of the project by special assessments, a district may create water districts, sewer districts, and water and sewer districts, and may extend any such district when necessary. The appropriate special improvement district must be created by resolution. The district must be designated by a name appropriate to the type of improvement for which it is created and by a number distinguishing it from other improvement districts. Nothing in this chapter prevents a district from making and financing any improvement and levying special assessments for the improvement under any alternate procedure in this title. For examinations or surveys, the board or its employees, after written notice to each landowner, may enter upon any land on which the proposed project is located or any other lands necessary to gain access.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any improvement district created by a district may embrace two or more separate property areas. Each improvement district must be of such size and form as to include all properties which in the judgment of the board, after consultation with the engineer planning the improvement, will be benefited by the construction of the improvement project which is proposed to be made in or for the district, or by any portion of the project. A single district may be created for an improvement of the type specified in section 61-35-48, notwithstanding any lack of uniformity among the types, items, or quantities of work and materials to be used at particular locations throughout the improvement district. The jurisdiction of a district to make, finance, and assess the cost of any improvement project may not be impaired by any lack of commonness, unity, or singleness of the location, purpose, or character of the improvement, or by the fact that any one or more of the properties included in the improvement district is subsequently determined not to be benefited by the improvement, or by a particular portion of the improvement project, and is not assessed for that purpose. The board may omit from a water or sewer district properties within the district limits which are benefited by the improvement but do not abut upon a water or sewer main, without prejudice to the right and power of the district subsequently to assess such properties to the extent and the manner permitted by law. The board may by resolution enlarge an improvement district in which an improvement is proposed or under construction upon receipt of a petition signed by the owners of three-fourths of the area to be added to the district.

      Upon the filing of the engineer’s report provided for in section 61-35-54, and after satisfying the requirements of section 61-35-55, the district board shall fix a date and place for public hearing on the proposed project. The place of hearing must be in the vicinity of the proposed project and must be convenient and accessible for the majority of the landowners subject to assessment for the project or whose property is subject to condemnation for the proposed project. The board shall cause a complete list of the benefits and assessments to be made, setting forth each county, township, or city assessed in its corporate capacity as well as each lot, piece, or parcel of land assessed, the amount each is benefited by the improvement, and the amount assessed against each. At least ten days before the hearing, the board shall file with the county auditor of each county in which the project is or will be located the list showing the percentage assessment and approximate assessment in dollars against each parcel of land benefited by the proposed project. Notice of the filing must be included in the notice of hearing. Notices of the hearing must contain a copy of the resolution of the board as well as the time and place where the board will conduct the hearing. The notice of hearing must specify when and where votes concerning the proposed project may be filed and contain an assessment list showing the percentage assessment and approximate assessment in dollars against each parcel of land benefited by the proposed project. The board shall cause the notice of hearing to be published once a week for two consecutive weeks in newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the affected landowners reside and in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located. The date set for the hearing may not be fewer than twenty days after the mailing of the notice. A record of the hearing must be made by the board, including a list of affected landowners present in person or by agent, and the record must be preserved in the minutes of the meeting. Affected landowners and the governing body of any county, township, or city to be assessed must be informed at the hearing of the probable total cost of the project and their individual share of the cost and the portion of their property, if any, to be condemned for the project.

      At the hearing, the affected landowners and any county, township, or city to be assessed must be informed when and where votes concerning the proposed project may be filed. Affected landowners and the governing body of any county, township, or city to be assessed have thirty days after the date of the hearing to file their votes with the secretary of the district. Once the deadline for filing votes has been reached, no more votes may be filed and no person may withdraw a vote. Any withdrawal of a vote concerning the proposed project before that time must be in writing. When the votes have been filed and the deadline for filing votes has passed, the board shall immediately determine whether the project is approved. If the board finds that fifty percent or more of the total votes filed are against the proposed project, then the vote constitutes a bar against proceeding further with the project. If the board finds that the number of votes filed against the proposed project is less than fifty percent of the votes filed, the board shall issue an order establishing the proposed project and may proceed, after complying with the requirements of sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-62" target="_self">61-35-62</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-63" target="_self">61-35-63</a></cite>, to contract or provide for the construction or maintenance of the project in substantially the manner and according to the forms and procedure provided in sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-88" target="_self">61-35-88</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-103" target="_self">61-35-103</a></cite>. The board may enter into any agreement with any federal or state agency under the terms of which the contract for the project is to be let by the federal agency, the state agency, or a combination thereof. In projects where there is an agreement that a party other than the board will let the contract, the board may dispense with all of the requirements of sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-88" target="_self">61-35-88</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-103" target="_self">61-35-103</a></cite>. Upon making an order establishing or denying establishment of a project, the board shall publish notice of the order in a newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the affected landowners reside and in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located. Any right of appeal begins to run on the date of publication of the notice.

     <p>
      In order that there may be a fair relationship between the amount of liability for assessments and the power of objecting to the establishment of a proposed project, the voting rights of affected landowners on the question of establishing the project are as provided in this section. The landowner of land affected by the project has one vote for each dollar of assessment to which the land is subject or one vote for each dollar of the assessed valuation of land condemned for the project, as determined in accordance with title 57. The governing body of any county, township, or city to be assessed has one vote for each dollar of assessment against such county, township, or city. There may be only one vote for each dollar of assessment, regardless of the number of owners of a tract of land. If more than one owner of a tract of land exists, the votes must be prorated among them in accordance with each owner’s property interest. A written power of attorney authorizes an agent to protest a project on behalf of any affected landowner or landowners.

      When the district board proposes to make any special assessment under this chapter, the board, prior to the hearing required under section 61-35-58 shall inspect any and all lots and parcels of land that may be subject to assessment and shall determine from the inspection the particular lots and parcels of lands which, in the opinion of the board, will be especially benefited by the construction of the work for which the assessment is made and shall assess the proportion of the total cost of acquiring right of way and constructing and maintaining such improvement in accordance with benefits received but not exceeding such benefits, against:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-61ol11">
       Any county, township, or city, in its corporate capacity, which may be directly or indirectly benefited by the improvement.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-61ol12">
       Any lot, piece, or parcel of land that is directly benefited by the improvement.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      In determining benefits, the board shall consider, among other factors, property values, degree of improvement of properties, and productivity. Property belonging to the United States is exempt from assessment unless the United States has provided for the payment of any assessment that may be levied against its property for benefits received. Benefited property belonging to the state, a county, a city, a school district, a park district, or a township is not exempt from assessment and political subdivisions that own assessed property shall provide for the payment of such assessments, including installments and interest, by the levy of taxes according to law. Any county, township, or city assessed in its corporate capacity for benefits received shall provide for the payment of those assessments, installments, and interest from its general fund or by levy of a general property tax against all the taxable property in the political subdivision in accordance with law. No tax limitation provided by any statute of this state applies to tax levies made by any political subdivision for paying any special assessments made under this chapter. There must be attached to the list of assessments a certificate signed by a majority of the members of the board certifying that it is a true and correct assessment of the benefit described to the best of their judgment and stating the several items of expense included in the assessment.

      After entering an order establishing the project, the district board shall cause the assessment list to be published once each week for two successive weeks in the newspapers of general circulation in the district and in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located. The publication must include a notice of the time and place the board will meet to hear objections to any assessment by any interested party, or an agent or attorney for that party. The date set for the hearing must be not less than twenty days after the first publication of the notice. At the hearing, the board may make such alterations in the assessments as in its opinion may be just and necessary to correct any error in the assessment but must make the aggregate of all assessments equal to the total amount required to pay the entire cost of the work for which the assessments are made or the part of the cost to be paid by special assessment. An assessment may not exceed the benefit as determined by the board to the parcel of land or political subdivision assessed. The board shall then confirm the assessment list and the secretary shall attach to the list a certificate that it is correct as confirmed by the board. The secretary shall file the list in the office of the district secretary.

       Reassessment of benefits.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The district board may hold at any time or, upon petition of any affected landowner or political subdivision which has been assessed after a project has been in existence for at least one year, shall hold a hearing for the purpose of determining the benefits of the project to each tract of land affected. At least ten days’ notice of the hearing must be given by publication in the newspaper or newspapers having general circulation in the district and in the official county newspaper of each county in which the benefited lands are located and by mailing notice by ordinary mail to each owner of land whose assessment is proposed to be raised as determined by the records of the recorder or county treasurer. The provisions of this chapter governing the original determination of benefits and assessment of costs apply to any reassessment of benefits carried out under this section. The board may not be forced to make a reassessment more than once every ten years. Any assessment or balance of an assessment supporting a project fund may not be reduced or impaired by reassessment or otherwise so long as bonds payable out of such fund remain unpaid and moneys are not available in such fund to pay all such bonds in full, with interest. Costs of maintenance must be prorated in accordance with any plan for reassessment of benefits that has been adopted.

       Lien of special assessment.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A special assessment imposed by a district, with accrued interest and penalties, is a lien upon the property on which the assessment is levied from the time the assessment list is approved by the district board until the assessment is fully paid. The liens have precedence over all other liens except general tax liens and may not be divested by any judicial sale. Mistake in the description of the property covered by the special assessment lien or in the name of the owner of such property does not defeat the lien if the assessed property can be identified by the description in the assessment list. This chapter must be considered notice to all subsequent encumbrances of the priority of special assessments imposed under this chapter.

       Sewer or water improvements in districts may be paid for by service charges.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A district constructing a sewer or water improvement under the special assessment method may resolve in the resolution or ordinance required by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-52" target="_self">61-35-52</a></cite>, that a portion of the cost of the improvement must be raised by service charges for the use of the improvement and of the utility of which it forms a part. If the district so resolves, it may determine in its resolutions, ordinances, and other proceedings relating to the levying of special assessments and the issuing of bonds to pay the cost of such improvement, that a specified portion or all of such cost must be assessed specially against any property specially benefited and may cause to be assessed only the portion so determined. In that event the entire remainder of the cost, including interest as well as principal of any bonds issued, over and above the amount of special assessments actually collected and received from time to time in the fund of the improvement district, must be paid from the net revenues derived from the service charges. All of the applicable provisions of this chapter relating to special assessments are applicable to such improvements except as to the portion of the cost of improvements resolved or ordained to be paid by service charges. The board of the district shall provide for the establishment, imposition, and collection of service charges for the services furnished by the improvement and the utility of which it forms a part, and in that connection it has all the rights and powers respecting such service charges as it would have with respect to like matters if the improvement were made in accordance with chapter 40-35. The net revenues derived from the imposition and collection of the service charges or any portion of the service charges as are determined by the board in the resolutions and ordinances must be paid into the appropriate improvement district funds created under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-83" target="_self">61-35-83</a></cite>. The revenues when collected must be used and applied in the same manner as moneys paid into such funds from the collection of special assessments. The board of any district issuing bonds to finance any such improvement, in its resolutions and ordinances, may establish an assessment reserve in the fund of the improvement district, to which it may appropriate net revenues of the utility or system from time to time received in excess of amounts required, with special assessments then on hand, to meet the principal and interest next due on the bonds. Before November first of any year the district may by resolution determine the proportion which the amount then on hand in the assessment reserve, and irrevocably appropriated to the payment of the bond, bears to the aggregate amount of the installment of the special assessments levied for the improvement which is payable in the following year, including interest. The district may direct the auditor to reduce, by not more than a proportionate amount, the total of that installment and interest which would otherwise be placed upon the tax list of the district for the current year, against each lot and tract of land assessed or taxed for improvement. If the installment of the special assessment on any property has been prepaid, the board may direct the district to refund, out of the assessment reserve, to the owner of the property at the time of the refund as indicated in the records of the recorder of the county, a sum not exceeding a similar proportion of the principal amount of such installment, excluding interest.

      When a district board, by resolution, has caused special assessments to be levied to cover the cost of constructing a project, the board shall determine the rate of interest unpaid special assessments are to bear, which rate may not exceed one and one-half percent above the bond rate. Interest on unpaid special assessments commences on the date the assessments are finally confirmed by the board. Special assessments may be certified and made payable in equal annual installments, the last of which must be due and payable not more than thirty years after date of the bonds to be paid.

Funds needed to pay the cost of maintaining a project may be raised in the same manner as funds were raised to meet construction costs.

       County treasurer to certify and receipt for amount of special assessments collected — Contents of certificate — Procedure for abatement.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Special assessments of any kind certified to the county auditor by the district treasurer must be paid to the county treasurer and included in the receipt required by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-20s57-20-08" target="_blank">57-20-08</a></cite>. If the county treasurer receives less than the full amount of taxes and special assessments due at any time on any lot or tract of real estate, the county treasurer shall allocate the amount of such payment between taxes and special assessments in proportion to the respective amounts of taxes and special assessments which are then due. When prorating any tax payment received before October fifteenth, the term “due”, as it pertains to real estate taxes, includes only the first installment of real estate taxes. Special assessments are not subject to abatement or refund by proceedings under chapter 57-32 but may be reviewed and corrected only in the manner and upon the conditions provided in chapter 40-26. The county treasurer, at the time set by law for the payment to the district treasurer of all the taxes and special assessments collected during the preceding month, shall certify the amounts of special assessments collected. The certificate must state specifically the lot or known subdivision as it appears on the tax books of the county treasurer, and the block, addition, amount collected, and amount credited to each lot or known subdivision, and the year for which the sum was collected. The certificate must be furnished to the district treasurer.

     <p>
      At any time after entering into a contract for a project to be financed in whole or in part by special assessments, a district may issue temporary and definitive bonds on the project fund, created for that purpose, in the manner and subject to the limitations prescribed in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-24s40-24-19" target="_blank">40-24-19</a></cite>. If the bonds are issued to finance a sewer or water project, the net revenues derived from the imposition of service charges to be imposed and collected with respect to the project as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-68" target="_self">61-35-68</a></cite> may be pledged to payment of those bonds, except that the first maturity date of any such bond may not be less than two years from the date of issuance. Bonds issued under this section must be in amounts as in the judgment of the board will be necessary for the project. The bonds must bear interest at a rate or rates and be sold at a price resulting in an average net interest cost not exceeding twelve percent per annum if sold at private sale. There is no interest rate ceiling on bond issues sold at public sale or to the state or any of its agencies or instrumentalities. The bonds must state upon their face the purpose for which they are issued and the project fund from which they are payable and must be signed by the chairman of the board and countersigned by the secretary of the district. The bonds must be payable serially in such amounts as the board determines, extending over a period of not more than thirty years.

     <p>
      Any district having outstanding special assessment bonds, payable in whole or in part out of collections from special assessments, which are past due or which are redeemable, either at the option of the district or with the consent of the bondholders, may issue refunding special assessment bonds if there is not sufficient money in the project fund against which such bonds are drawn to pay the same. The issuance of refunding bonds must be authorized by resolution of the district board. The resolution must describe the bonds to be refunded and their amount and maturity. Refunding bonds may be issued for any of the following purposes:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-86ol11">

      Refunding bonds must bear such date, be in such date, be in such denominations, and mature serially within such time, not exceeding thirty years from date of issuance, as the board determines. The average rate of interest on the bonds may not exceed the average rate of interest on refunded bonds.
     </p>
     <p>
      The treasurer of the district shall pay special assessment bonds as they mature and are presented for payment out of the fund against which they are drawn and shall cancel the bonds when paid. Any deficiency in any fund created for the payment of district bonds payable in whole or in part out of collections of special assessment taxes must be the general obligation of the district.

In that case, the district may recover in a suit on the defaulting bidder’s bond the difference between the actual cost to the district of the improvements and the sum that it would have cost if the defaulting bidder had complied with the bidder’s bid.

     <p>
      If the board, at any time, deems the bond of a contractor insufficient either in form or as to sureties, it may require the successful bidder or contractor to furnish, within such reasonable time as the board may fix, a new bond to be approved by the board. If the contractor fails, after notice, to furnish the new bond within the time required, the contractor’s contract may be canceled, and in that event the contractor’s bond will be liable as if the contractor had failed to perform the contract.

     <p>
      A contract let under this chapter requires the work to be done pursuant to the plans and specifications on file in the office of the district, subject to the approval of the engineer acting for the district, and must provide:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-102ol11">
       That the board has the right to suspend the work at any time for improper construction and to relet the contract or to order a reconstruction of the work as to any part improperly done.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-102ol12">
       The time within which the work must be completed.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-102ol13">
       The period of time for which the work must be guaranteed as to workmanship and materials.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-102ol14">
       The fund from which the contract price is to be paid by the district.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-102ol15">
       That the consideration expressed in the contract is payable only in bonds drawn on the fund described in the contract.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-102ol16">
       That the district assumes and incurs no general liability under the contract.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-35s61-35-102ol17">
       That failure of the engineer to reject work and materials that are not up to specifications and acceptance of the job by the engineer does not release the contractor from liability for any failure on the contractor’s part to perform work or furnish materials in accordance with the plans and specifications.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The engineer acting for the district shall provide construction administration and observation of the work during its progress. In addition to any rights a district may have under its contract for construction of part or all of an improvement after a contract has been awarded and before work under the contract has been completed, a district, with the consent of the contractor and without advertising for bids, may order additional work done by that contractor of the same character as the work that was contracted for, whether within or without the improvement district for which the original contract was made, and upon the same terms and conditions specified in the original contract except as to time of performance, and at the same prices for the additional work; provided, that the total price payable to the contractor for the additional work may not exceed twenty percent of the amount estimated by the engineer for the district to be payable for that character of work under the original contract.

     <p>
      If the contractor to whom a contract is let properly performs the work designated in the contract, the board, at least once in each calendar month during the continuance of the contract work, shall meet and receive and consider estimates furnished by the agent, engineer, or architect acting for the district or if not so furnished, then by the contractor, and shall allow such estimates in an amount of the estimated value of the labor and material furnished upon the contract, and of the material then upon the ground for use in the contract, subject to retentions as follows: ten percent of each estimate presented until such time as the project is fifty percent completed, with no further retainage on estimates during the continuance of the contract. Upon completion of ninety-five percent of the contract according to the estimates, the board may pay to the contractor ninety-five percent of the amount retained from previous estimates. Any amount retained after ninety-five percent completion of the contract must be paid to the contractor in such amounts and at such times as are approved by the district, upon estimates by its agent, engineer, or architect or the contractor, with final payment of all moneys due to the contractor to be made immediately following completion and acceptance of the project. Immediately after considering and allowing any such estimate, the board shall certify and forward the same to the district treasurer or other official having the power to draw bonds, who forthwith shall draw a warrant upon the proper fund and transmit the same promptly to the contractor. If the board fails or neglects to receive and allow such estimate or certify any estimate or final payment upon completion and acceptance or the proper officer required to issue such warrant fails or neglects to issue a warrant as provided in this section, for a period of more than thirty days from the date of such estimate or completion date, then the estimate or final payment, together with any retainage properly payable, draws interest from its date at the rate per annum of two percentage points below the Bank of North Dakota prime interest rate as set thirty days from the date of such estimate or completion date until the issuance of a proper warrant. Interest must be computed and added to the face of the estimate, final payment, or retainage by the officer required to issue the warrant, must be included in the warrant when drawn, and must be charged to the fund from which payment for the improvement is to be made. On the amounts of estimates retained, as provided in this section, the board, authorized committee, or public body in charge of the work may invest or deposit the retained amounts in any financial association or institution in this state earning interest or dividends for the benefit of the contractor. Any amounts so invested or deposited must remain in the name of the board, authorized committee, or public body in charge of the work until final payment of all money due to the contractor is to be made. Further, a contractor may not use or pledge such amount in any manner until released and received by the contractor upon completion of the contract.

      Participation in the program by an irrigation district is voluntary and no irrigation district may be required to sell its municipal security issues to the program. Notwithstanding any other law, an irrigation district that wishes to participate in the program may enter into an agreement with the program for the purchase by the program of a municipal security issue of the irrigation district, including the purchase by the program of an issue of refunding municipal securities, which may be required by agreement with the program to be issued at a rate of interest higher or lower than that of the municipal security issue to be refunded.

       Guarantee, lending, and borrowing powers.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The program may guarantee municipal securities issued by an irrigation district. The program may lend money to irrigation districts through the purchase and holding of municipal securities which are eligible for purchase by the program, under this chapter, according to the terms of a guarantee by the program for the payment of debt service on a municipal security of an irrigation district. However, the program may lend money to irrigation districts through the purchase and holding of municipal securities issued by the irrigation district, without regard to the initial issuance of a guarantee of the principal amount and interest payable on the municipal securities issued, if the commission approves a resolution that authorizes the program to purchase and hold those municipal securities. The authorizing resolution must state that the commission has determined that private bond markets will not be responsive to the needs of the issuing irrigation district concerning the municipal securities or that the municipal securities cannot be sold through private bond markets without the guarantee of the program. The program may hold municipal securities acquired under this chapter for any length of time necessary. The program, for the purposes authorized by this chapter, may issue its bonds payable solely from the revenues available to the program which are authorized or pledged for payment of program bonds and obligations, and assist irrigation districts as provided in this chapter. Bonds or guarantees of the program issued under this chapter are not a debt or liability of the state and do not constitute a loan of the credit of the state, create any debt or liability on behalf of the state, or constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the state. The bonds are payable solely from revenues pledged or available for their payment as authorized in this chapter. Each bond must contain on its face a statement to the effect that the program is obligated to pay the principal or interest, and redemption premium, if any, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state is pledged to the payment of the principal or the interest on the bonds. Specific funds pledged to fulfill the program’s obligations are obligations of the program. All expenses incurred in carrying out this chapter are payable solely from revenues or funds provided or to be provided under this chapter and nothing in this chapter may be construed to authorize the program to incur any indebtedness or liability on behalf of or payable by the state. Guarantees or bonds issued under this chapter are in the public interest and are not subject to the limitation contained in subsection 2 of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-02s61-02-46" target="_self">61-02-46</a></cite>.

       The program shall establish and maintain a reserve fund in which there must be deposited all moneys appropriated by the state for the purpose of the fund, all proceeds of bonds required to be deposited by terms of any contract between the program and its bondholders or any resolution of the program with respect to the proceeds of bonds, any other moneys or funds of the program which are deposited by the program, any contractual right to the receipt of moneys by the program for the purpose of the fund, including a letter of credit or similar instrument, and any other moneys made available to the program only for the purposes of the fund from any other source. Moneys in the reserve fund must be held and applied solely to the payment of the interest on and the principal of bonds and sinking fund payments as they become due and payable and for the retirement of bonds, including payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when any bonds are redeemed or retired prior to maturity, and for the payment of principal and interest on municipal securities guaranteed by the program. Moneys in the reserve fund may not be withdrawn if the withdrawal would reduce the amount in the reserve fund to less than the required debt service reserve, except for payment of interest then due and payable on bonds and the principal of bonds then maturing and payable, sinking fund payments, the retirement of bonds in accordance with the terms of any contract between the program and its bondholders, the payment of principal and interest on municipal securities of an irrigation district for which a guarantee has been issued by the program, and for the payments on account of which interest or principal or sinking fund payments or retirement of bonds or execution of a guarantee, other moneys of the program are not then available in accordance with the terms of the contract. The reserve fund may not be used for the payment of a guarantee by the program unless the commission has determined that bonds of the program cannot be issued under acceptable terms for the payment of the guarantee, or the payment of the guarantee will not reduce the reserve fund to an amount less than the required debt service reserve. The required debt service reserve must be an aggregate amount equal to at least the largest amount of money required by the terms of all contracts between the program and its bondholders to be raised in the then current or any succeeding calendar year for the payment of interest on and maturing principal of outstanding bonds, and sinking fund payments required by the terms of any contracts to sinking funds established for the payment or redemption of the bonds.

       If the establishment of the reserve fund for an issue or the maintenance of an existing reserve fund at a required level under this section would necessitate the investment of all or any portion of a new reserve fund or all or any portion of an existing reserve fund at a restricted yield, because not restricting the yield may cause the bonds to be taxable under the Internal Revenue Code, then, at the discretion of the program, no reserve fund need be established prior to the issuance of bonds, the reserve fund need not be funded to the levels required by this section, or an existing reserve fund may be reduced.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-37s61-37-10ol13">
       No bonds may be issued by the program unless there is in the reserve fund the required debt service reserve for all bonds then issued and outstanding and for the bonds to be issued. Nothing in this chapter prevents the program from satisfying this requirement by depositing upon issuance so much of the proceeds of the bonds to be issued, as is needed to achieve the required debt service reserve. The program may, at any time, issue its bonds or notes for the purpose of providing any amount necessary to increase the amount in the reserve fund to the required debt service reserve, or to meet higher or additional reserves as may be fixed by the program.
      </li>
      <li id="t61c61-37s61-37-10ol14">
       In order to ensure maintenance of the required debt service reserve, the legislative assembly shall appropriate and deposit in the reserve fund the amount certified by the commission as necessary to restore the reserve fund to an amount equal to the required debt service reserve, or maintain a reserve fund established by the commission under this chapter and required according to the terms of a guarantee issued by the program. However, the commission may approve a resolution for the issuance of bonds, as provided by this chapter, which states in substance that this subsection is not applicable to the required debt service reserve for bonds issued under the resolution.

      <li id="t61c61-37s61-37-10ol15">
       If the maturity of a series of bonds of the program is three years or less from the date of issuance of the bonds, the program may determine that no reserve fund need be established for that respective series of bonds, or that it may be established in an amount less than the required debt service reserve. If such a determination is made, holders of the respective series of bonds may have no interest in or claim on existing reserve funds established for the security of the holders of previously issued program bonds and may have no interest in or claim on reserve funds established for the holders of subsequent issues of bonds of the program.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly declares many areas and localities in eastern and central North Dakota do not enjoy adequate quantities of high-quality drinking water; other areas and localities in eastern and central North Dakota do not have sufficient quantities of water to ensure a dependable, long-term supply; greater economic security and the protection of health and property benefits the land and water resources of this state; and the promotion of the prosperity and general welfare of all of the people of this state depend on the effective development and utilization of the land and water resources of this state and requires the exercise of the sovereign powers of this state and concern a public purpose. To accomplish this public purpose, a water authority is needed to store and distribute water to eastern and central North Dakota to provide for the supply and distribution of water to the people of eastern and central North Dakota for purposes, including domestic, rural water, municipal, livestock, industrial, and other uses, with primary emphasis on domestic, rural water, and municipal uses; and provide for the future economic welfare and prosperity of the people of this state, and particularly the people of eastern and central North Dakota, by the bulk purchase of water from the Garrison Diversion Conservancy District delivered by the Red River valley water supply project for beneficial and public uses. The Garrison Diversion Conservancy District may acquire, construct, and improve the Red River valley water supply project and may enter water supply contracts with member cities and water districts for the sale of water for consumption within or outside the district or the state, including with Canada. Alternatively, the Lake Agassiz water authority may enter one or more contracts to provide for the authority to acquire bulk water from the Garrison Diversion Conservancy District and may enter water supply contracts with member cities and water districts for the resale of this water for consumption within or outside the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly acknowledges North Dakota and Minnesota communities jointly use the Red River as a water resource. It is in the best interest of eastern North Dakota also to study and possibly provide for the water needs of those Minnesota communities through a Red River valley water supply project, particularly if that project maintains the use of the Red River for North Dakota communities.
     </p>
     <p>
      In furtherance of this public purpose, the state water commission may provide for the issuance of bonds in accordance with chapter 61-02 to finance the costs of any project to deliver water to eastern and central North Dakota or utilize other financing as addressed in this chapter. This chapter does not abrogate or limit the rights, powers, duties, and functions of the state water commission or department of water resources, but is supplementary to those rights, powers, duties, and functions.

      The Lake Agassiz water authority consists of cities, water districts, and other water distribution systems located in that part of the state which is included within the boundaries of Cavalier, Pembina, Walsh, Nelson, Grand Forks, Griggs, Steele, Traill, Barnes, Cass, Ransom, Sargent, Richland, and Stutsman Counties and that pay dues to the authority. Minnesota cities may join the authority, provided a portion of the city is located within five miles [8.05 kilometers] of this state, or if the city uses the Red River for its primary water supply. Any other county, city, water district, or Canadian governmental entity or water supply system may join the authority upon application of its board and approval of the application by a majority of the authority’s board. The authority shall require any new member to pay for a pro rata share of the project costs previously incurred by the authority members. The authority also may require an entity contracting for a water supply to pay an additional fee if the entity joins the project late. The authority is a governmental agency, body politic and corporate with the authority to exercise the power specified in this chapter, or which may be reasonably implied. Cities, water districts, and other water distribution systems may pay dues to the authority as determined by the authority.

       Legislative declarations — Authority of western area water supply authority.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly declares that many areas and localities in western North Dakota do not enjoy adequate quantities of high-quality drinking water; that other areas and localities in western North Dakota do not have sufficient quantities of water to ensure a dependable, long-term domestic or industrial water supply; that greater economic security and the protection of health and property benefits the land, natural resources, and water resources of this state; and that the promotion of the prosperity and general welfare of all of the people of this state depend on the effective development and utilization of the land and water resources of this state and necessitates and requires the exercise of the sovereign powers of this state and concern a public purpose. To accomplish this public purpose, it is declared necessary that a water authority to treat, store, and distribute water to western North Dakota be established to provide for the supply and distribution of water to the people of western North Dakota for purposes, including domestic, rural water, municipal, livestock, industrial, oil and gas development, and other uses, and provide for the future economic welfare and prosperity of the people of this state, and particularly the people of western North Dakota, by the creation and development of a western area water supply project for beneficial and public uses. The western area water supply authority may acquire, construct, improve, develop, and own water supply infrastructure and may enter water supply contracts with member cities, water districts, and private users, such as oil and gas producers, for the sale of water for use within or outside the authority boundaries or the state. The western area water supply authority shall consider in the process of locating industrial water depots the location of private water sellers so as to minimize the impact on private water sellers. The independent water providers shall consider in the process of locating industrial water depots the location of private water sellers so as to minimize the impact on private water sellers.

     <p>
      The western area water supply authority consists of participating political subdivisions located within McKenzie, Williams, Burke, Divide, and Mountrail Counties which enter a water supply contract with the authority. Other cities and water systems, within or outside the authority counties’ boundaries, including cities or water systems in Montana, may contract with the authority for a bulk water supply. The authority is a political subdivision of the state, a governmental agency, body politic and corporate, with the authority to exercise the powers specified in this chapter, or which may be reasonably implied. Participating member entities may be required to pay dues or water sale income to the authority, as determined by the bylaws and future resolutions of the authority. Participating member entities may not withdraw from the authority or fail or refuse to pay any water sale income to the authority until the state-guaranteed loans have been repaid. The provisions of subsections 1 through 5 of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t61c61-35s61-35-02.1" target="_self">61-35-02.1</a></cite> apply if the authority’s board of directors unanimously votes to convert to a water district.
