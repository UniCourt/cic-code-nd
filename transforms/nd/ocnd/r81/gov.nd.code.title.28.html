   To be entitled to a decree of adverse possession the property of another must be held by open and hostile possession for a specific time. Benson v. Taralseth, 382 N.W.2d 649, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 265</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   Northern portion of a property belonged to neighbors because the neighbors, and their predecessors in interest, continuously and exclusively possessed the land for the requisite period of time. The prior possessors built a stone wall and fire pit, drilled a well, and paid waterfront taxes on the land, while the neighbors used the water well, owned a dock on the shore, placed their picnic table on the property, moved their paddle boat alongside the dock, parked a mobile home trailer on part of the land, and paid waterfront taxes.

   In a case where a county was seeking a formal judicial declaration of a public road under the specific language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.24.html#t24c24-07s24-07-01" target="_blank">24-07-01</a></cite>, an owner’s reliance upon N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-04" target="_self">28-01-04</a></cite> was misplaced because the action was not one seeking the recovery of real property or the possession thereof. A specific statute controlled over the general one.

   McKenzie County v. Reichman, 2012 ND 20, 812 N.W.2d 332, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>

   Plain language of the statute states it applies in actions for the recovery or possession of real property, and as this was an action to recover real property, the statute applied. Markgraf v. Welker, 2015 ND 303, 873 N.W.2d 26, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 318</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>

   Whether the statute applied would depend on whether an implied trust was created and, if a trust existed, whether it was repudiated, and it was not appropriate to decide this issue on summary judgment. Markgraf v. Welker, 2015 ND 303, 873 N.W.2d 26, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 318</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>

   There was no evidence a trustee said or did anything in open contravention of the terms of the trust and acted in a manner amounting to a denial of the trust's existence. The Supreme Court concluded the district court did not err in finding the trust was not repudiated and the statute of limitations did not preclude plaintiffs' action. Markgraf v. Welker, 2017 ND 219, 902 N.W.2d 492, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 222</cite> (N.D. 2017).

   District court did not err when it rejected a royalty interest holder’s argument that the statute barred a partnership’s claim to disputed interests because the holder asserted the statute applied in a conclusory fashion unsupported by analysis or relevant authority.

   Property owner’s argument that boundary line was established by acquiescent possession during a twenty year period prior to the City taking title in 1979 failed, where no evidence was presented that the City recognized the boundary claimed by the owner and thus the twenty year period began to run only after the City relinquished its title to the property owner.

   Before the statute of limitations on an action for adverse possession could begin to run against the beneficiary of a trust repudiated by the trustee, the beneficiary must have had knowledge of the repudiation, and the trustee was required to inform him of the acquisition of any interest in the trust property adverse to his own.

   Where neither party had actual or constructive possession of the fifty percent mineral interest, neither parties’ quiet title claim to the mineral interest was barred by this section; in determining whether parties may maintain actions to quiet title to mineral interest under this section, possession is the crucial factor. Wehner v. Schroeder, 335 N.W.2d 563, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 340</cite> (N.D. 1983).

   Unless plaintiff was seized or possessed of the property at issue within 20 years before he began the quiet title action, he is barred from maintaining an action to quiet title to the property. Haas v. Bursinger, 470 N.W.2d 222, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a quiet title action, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment against plaintiffs and dismissing their claims against defendants as plaintiffs' action was time-barred based on the 20-year limitation period because, on appeal, plaintiffs attacked property transfers made in the 1950s, but plaintiffs failed to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact as none of the submitted documents and materials established plaintiffs were seized or possessed of the property at issue within the preceding 20 years before the action was commenced.

   In an adverse possession action, the district court’s finding that the annual cutting of hay was not cultivation, continuous, and exclusive of the owner’s right of title and was not adverse to owner was supported by the owner’s testimony that he always allowed others to hay the disputed property for free because it was uneconomical to hay and he did not want the hay.

   For acts to be adverse, they must not only be actual, but also visible, continuous, notorious, distinct, and hostile, and of such character as to indicate unmistakably an assertion of claim of exclusive ownership by the occupant.

   To be adverse, acts set forth in this section must be not only actual but also visible, continuous, notorious, distinct, and hostile and of such character as to indicate unmistakably an assertion of claim of exclusive ownership by the occupant; and inclosure is not sufficient to establish title by adverse possession where it is only temporary or is not maintained for period of limitation prescribed; where fence was built in 1936, largely destroyed in 1943 and not rebuilt until 1959, claimant did not establish adverse possession by substantial inclosure for period of at least twenty years; where field was planted in crops for only four years and was used periodically thereafter for pasturage of cattle and for hunting, no adverse possession was established. Martin v. Rippel, 152 N.W.2d 332, 1967 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1967).

   District court did not err in deciding plaintiffs had acquired their interest in the platted roadway by adverse possession where the evidence at trial showed that at least since the 1960s, no such roadway had ever existed or been used by the public, and thus, the platted roadway was subject to an adverse possession claim. Larson v. Jon Tonneson, 2019 ND 230, 933 N.W.2d 84, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   Mere permissive possession by a cotenant is presumed to be in the exercise of his rights as a cotenant unless it is clearly shown that such possession is not only actual but is exclusive and hostile as well; and where all of the acts relied upon by a cotenant to establish his adverse possession of the common property are consistent with his ownership of the common property as a tenant in common with defendants, an action by the plaintiff-cotenant to quiet title to the common property in himself by reason of his adverse possession of such property for the statutory period will not succeed.

   Where defendant and predecessor had been in possession of disputed strip of land for more than twenty years before their rental from plaintiff’s father of land which included disputed strip, defendant and predecessor had actual adverse possession of strip for more than twenty years before relationship of landlord and tenant came into existence, and thus doctrine that tenant cannot hold adversely to his landlord was inapplicable.

   In an action to settle boundary dispute, defendants failed to prove adverse possession for requisite twenty-year period, since for a portion of the period they were tenants and operation of this section required that their possession could not commence until former status as tenants terminated.

   In action by heirs of deceased landlord to quiet title, tenant was not estopped from asserting a title adverse to his landlord where he purchased the land from the county, which acquired it at a tax sale. Klemesrud v. Blikre, 75 N.W.2d 522, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   Where no landlord-tenant relationship exists at the time a county sells property acquired by it by tax title, a former tenant is not barred by this section from purchasing the property from the county and such purpose does not inure to the benefit of the former landlord.

   When action for the reformation of ground lease accrued based upon the question of when a party acquired, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have acquired, knowledge of a mutual mistake was a question of fact which was not appropriate for summary judgment. Diocese of Bismarck Trust v. Ramada, Inc., 553 N.W.2d 760, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Two companies that acquired oil and gas interests that belonged to a third company (“debtor”) while the debtor was in Chapter 7 bankruptcy were not barred by
        N.D.C.C. § 28-01-15 from seeking reformation of documents that transferred the debtor's interests because they discovered the fact that there were problems with the documents less than ten years before they sought reformation, and the court was allowed under
        N.D.C.C. § 9-06-07 to consider extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the bankruptcy trustee when he sold the debtor's property, and to order reformation of the documents pursuant to
        N.D.C.C. § 32-04-17 to the extent they did not accurately convey interests the trustee intended to sell.

   In a mortgage foreclosure proceeding, a mortgagor was precluded from raising an issue based on the statute of limitations on appeal because the mortgagor failed to raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense in his answer or in response to the mortgagee’s motion for summary judgment.

   In action for specific performance of contract which granted a provisional qualified easement across the landowner’s land to construct a farm-to-market road, trial court properly ruled that the statute of limitations to be applied is this section due to the fact that the landowner’s contract with the county was contained in an instrument granting the county an easement across the land. Huber v. Oliver County, 529 N.W.2d 179, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1995).

   claims to land that the claimant asserted the claimant owned, as the exception permitted the opposing parties to challenge the claimant’s action based on a contract for the sale of lands in a case where the claimant asserted ownership based on an allegedly unbroken claim of title to an interest in land and possession of land.

   An action for reformation of a deed accrues, not at the time of execution of the instrument in question, but at the time the facts which constitute the mistake and form the basis for reformation have been, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been, discovered by the party applying for relief; therefore, whether or not this section and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-16" target="_self">28-01-16</a></cite> bar a reformation action depends upon what time the facts constituting the mistake and forming the basis for reformation were discovered or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been discovered.

   District court properly found an oil company’s quiet title action was untimely and awarded the mineral interests at issue to the landowners because the oil company, as a purchaser, was on constructive notice of any flaws in the title record, and a simple examination of the title records would have revealed the discrepancy between the 1959 contract for deed, which reserved the oil and mineral rights to the original grantor, and the warranty deed, which did not, and, even using the last transaction on the property involving the oil company or its predecessors in interest, which took place in May 1990, as the time in which the discrepancy accrued, the 10-year statute of limitations had run.

   Although the lessee argued that the railroad’s statute of limitations defense should be precluded by the doctrine of equitable estoppel, the North Dakota Supreme Court found that the lessee did not properly raise the issue of the doctrine of equitable estoppel before the district court; therefore, he was precluded from raising the doctrine on appeal, and the statute of limitations time barred the lessee’s claims pertaining to underground fuel tanks located on the property.

   Where 1980 South Dakota judgment arising from an action brought on a 1959 South Dakota judgment constituted a new judgment under South Dakota law, this section’s statute of limitations began to run from the date of the 1980 judgment in an action in this state on the 1980 judgment.

   Under the provision that a judgment may be enforced by execution at any time within ten years after its entry, a judgment cannot be properly enforced by execution issued after that time, though the judgment debtor has been continually absent from the state during such time, and the judgment remains in force for that reason. Weisbecker v. Cahn, 14 N.D. 390, 104 N.W. 513, 1905 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 54</cite> (N.D. 1905).
       </p>
       <p>

   The absence of the judgment debtor from this state tolls the statute of limitations, and the judgment, though dormant so far as it relates to liens and for the purposes of execution, is not dead, and will support an action against the judgment debtor after ten years have elapsed.

   District court erred in denying a default judgment and in dismissing a judgment creditor’s action to renew a prior judgment because the creditor’s pleading was clearly an action on the original judgment seeking to renew the judgment, not an attempt to bring a “duplicate” action on the original debt, and the action was commenced by personal service upon the debtor within the 10-year statutory period.

       <p>

   The legislative assembly may lessen the statutory period within which an action may be brought. Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Braithwaite, 7 N.D. 358, 75 N.W. 244, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 1898).
       </p>
       <p>

   The legislative assembly may lessen the statutory period even as to existing causes of action, if the suitor has a reasonable time in which to sue after the statute making the change is enacted. Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Braithwaite, 7 N.D. 358, 75 N.W. 244, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 1898).
       </p>
       <p>

   In any case in which the legislative assembly shortens a statutory period of limitations, and makes the amended act apply to existing causes of action, it must fix a time within which an action may be brought upon such existing causes. Osborne v. Lindstrom, 9 N.D. 1, 81 N.W. 72, 1899 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1899); Power v. Kitching, 10 N.D. 254, 86 N.W. 737, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   Lapse of time will not bar the remedy to enforce a tax lien against land. Wells County v. McHenry, 7 N.D. 246, 74 N.W. 241, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 1898).

       <p>

   A cause of action for the enforcement of a lien upon or other right to specific property first accrues when the right to resort to that remedy arises. Paine v. Dodds, 14 N.D. 189, 103 N.W. 931, 116 Am. St. Rep. 674 (1905), decided prior to the enactment of Chapter 5, p. 9, of the 1905 Laws; distinguished, Baird v.

   In a case in which plaintiff alleged that defendant petroleum company wrongfully deducted certain costs from gas royalties paid to plaintiff under a lease between the parties, the district court properly applied the ten-year statute of limitations in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-15" target="_self">28-01-15</a></cite>(2) to plaintiff's breach of contract action for the underpayment of royalties. The six-year statute of limitations in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-16" target="_self">28-01-16</a></cite> did not apply. Kittleson v. Grynberg Petro.

   Obligation to pay royalties under an oil and gas lease is a contract contained in a conveyance or instrument affecting title to real property within the meaning of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-15" target="_self">28-01-15</a></cite>(2).

   For purposes of this section, a cause of action or claim for relief does not accrue until the aggrieved party discovers the facts which constitute the basis for its cause of action or claim for relief. Hebron Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 13 v. United States Gypsum Co., 475 N.W.2d 120, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Cause of action accrues when the right to commence it comes into existence; occurring with the conjunction of damage and wrongful act so that it can be brought in a court of law without being subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim.

        Inventor’s action against marketer of invention for negligent failure to file patent application didn’t accrue until 1972 where the failure to timely file occurred in 1962, but inventor suffered no injury until 1972 when the marketer stopped paying inventor the royalties to which the patent entitled him under the parties’ agreement. Keller v. Clark Equip. Co., 715 F.2d 1280, 1983 U.S. App. LEXIS 24991 (8th Cir. N.D. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1044, 104 S. Ct. 713, 79 L. Ed. 2d 176, 1984 U.S. LEXIS 595 (U.S. 1984).

   The tax commissioner’s cause of action accrued when the taxpayer’s taxes became due under subsection 1 of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-51s57-51-05" target="_blank">57-51-05</a></cite>.

   Because this provision is silent on when an action accrues, the determination is left to the court. Kuntz v. Muehler, 1999 ND 215, 603 N.W.2d 43, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Any cause of action alleged by plaintiff which accrued on or after April 13, 1998 was not time barred under N.D.C.C. § 28-01-16; however, the ongoing injuries as alleged by plaintiff, attributable in part to a corporate “freeze-out,” did not turn the case into a continuing tort. The facts as alleged did not support a continuing tort but instead a series of separate torts combined in one lawsuit with separate and successive injuries, as the defendants’
        acts were not interdependent but each constituted a potential breach of fiduciary duty standing alone. Therefore, the claims that accrued before April 13, 1998 were barred by the six-year statute of limitations.
        Roemmich v. Eagle Eye Dev., LLC, 386 F. Supp. 2d 1089, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20181 (D.N.D. 2005), aff'd, 526 F.3d 343, 2008 U.S. App. LEXIS 10239 (8th Cir. N.D. 2008).

   District court did not err in finding that the six-year statute of limitations barred plaintiff’s action alleging that defendant wrongfully possessed his investment funds; a reasonable person should have known a cause of action existed after repeatedly requesting a return of his funds for years without success, and thus plaintiff should have known defendant was not going to return the money no later than 2007, and his cause of action should have been brought no less than six years later. Pettinger v. Carroll, 2018 ND 140, 912 N.W.2d 305, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 2018).

   District court properly granted a motion filed by a personal representative’s attorney for summary judgment in a probate claimant’s action for fraud and injury to person because the claims were barred by the six-year statute of limitations where the claimant was aware of facts sufficient to put him on notice of a potential claim against the attorney for allegedly misleading him during the probate and by dismissing his claim against the estate.

   Because a creditor’s claim for tort damages can be filed in a probate proceeding under Title 30.1, the death of a potential defendant before the period of the statute of limitations has run on a tort claim does not make this section ineffective, and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-26" target="_self">28-01-26</a></cite> does not apply.

   Upon the death of a person liable to suit on a tort claim for damages, the time to sue the decedent’s estate is measured from the date of the injury; that person’s death only causes a temporary suspension that extends the limitation period by three months under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.30.1.html#t30c30.1-19s30.1-19-02" target="_blank">30.1-19-02</a></cite>.

   Although the six-year statute of limitations in this section refers only to “fraud” rather than “deceit,” the determination of which statute of limitation is applicable in a given case rests on the actual nature of the action.

       <p>

   The word “discovery” is not convertible with “knowledge”. If there is notice of facts, or if there is information that puts plaintiff on inquiry that would have led to knowledge, there is a “discovery”, and the plaintiff must be charged with notice of everything to which inquiry might have led. Roether v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 51 N.D. 634, 200 N.W. 818, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>

   Notice of facts which would have led to the knowledge of fraud constitutes “discovery” within a statute limiting the cause of action for fraud. Barnes v. Cass County, 59 N.D. 135, 228 N.W. 839, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Discovery” means “notice of the facts” and, in an action against physicians for assault and malpractice and fraudulent concealment of the removal of certain organs from plaintiff’s body, where it was found that plaintiff, by diligence, might have discovered the removal in 1950, a cause of action for fraudulent concealment could not be commenced in 1957, more than six years after discovery. Linke v. Sorenson, 276 F.2d 151, 1960 U.S. App. LEXIS 4929 (8th Cir. N.D. 1960).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where counties received less money than they were entitled to under law on distribution of motor vehicle registration fees, their cause of action against counties receiving excess accrued at time distribution was mistakenly made, since there was no concealment by defendants and since by exercising reasonable diligence plaintiffs could have discovered mistake. Richland County v. State, 180 N.W.2d 649, 1970 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cases involving latent-product defects, such as asbestos-containing materials, are governed by the “discovery rule” which modifies this section; the discovery rule tolls the statute of limitations until the time a plaintiff actually learned, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have learned, of his or her cause of action against the defendant.
        Drayton Public School Dist. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., 728 F. Supp. 1410, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15870 (D.N.D. 1989).

   When a plaintiff is aware of his or her injury, but not the full extent of those injuries, a “discovery rule” should not be applied to toll the statute of limitations. Erickson v. Scotsman, Inc., 456 N.W.2d 535, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1990).

   Material issue of fact existed as to when a widow discovered, or reasonably should have discovered, the possible cause of a decedent’s cancer as, although the medical records indicated that exposure to asbestos could be the underlying etiological factor of his condition, there was nothing that indicated that this information was ever provided to the decedent or his widow. Thus, the widow’s survival action was improperly dismissed on summary judgment.

   In a fraud case, a district court did not err in determining that October 4, 2006, was the discovery date triggering the six-year statute of limitations because that was the date that suspicion of theft was report to law enforcement; the limitations period expired when the summons and complaint were not served until October 6, 2013.

   In an action for breach of fiduciary duties and deceit, the district court did not err in concluding that plaintiff had been placed on notice of its claims no later than March 14, 2012, and that plaintiff’s assertion of the claims in July 2018 was outside the six year statute of limitations. Plaintiff’s request and review of the discussions leading up to a joint venture, and the receipt of a March 14, 2012 email provided sufficient notice of facts that would cause a reasonable person to exercise reasonable diligence to discover the potential claims.

   The doctrine of equitable estoppel may operate to preclude the application of a statute of limitations as a defense by one whose actions mislead another, thereby inducing him to not file a claim within the statute of limitations. Thus, a delay may be excusable where, provided it is not unreasonably protracted, it is induced by defendant’s promises, suggestions, or assurances which, if carried into effect, would result in a solution or adjustment without litigation. Schmidt v. Grand Forks Country Club, 460 N.W.2d 125, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   While the mere conduct of settlement negotiations or discussions by a defendant with a plaintiff does not alone provide a basis for estopping the defendant from pleading the statute of limitations, it is sufficient if the defendant’s conduct or promises are such as are naturally calculated to and do induce plaintiff into a belief that his claim would be adjusted if he did not sue. Schmidt v. Grand Forks Country Club, 460 N.W.2d 125, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>

   Plaintiff may not invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel against a defendant unless the plaintiff exercises due diligence in commencing the appropriate legal proceeding after the circumstances giving rise to estoppel have ceased to be operational, that is, after plaintiff has notice, actual or constructive, that he must resort to legal recourse and may no longer rely upon agreements, promises, representations to the contrary, or conduct or deceptive practices which may have lulled him into a sense of security.

   In a creditor’s claim against the estate of petitioner’s mother for the balance due on loans made to her during her lifetime, where the trial court found that petitioner reasonably relied on repeated assurances that loans would be paid and thus did not bring a claim until after their deaths, the estate was barred by equitable estoppel from asserting the statute of limitations as a defense to repayment.

   District court properly granted summary judgment quieting title in a tract of land to a buyer, directing the trust to convey the land to him, and dismissing the trust's counterclaims because, assuming there was fraud by the buyer, the counterclaims were untimely, the trust's acceptance of sporadic payments for more than 30 years waived the clause in the contract for deed making time of the essence, and, although the buyer might have continued to make sporadic payments to the trust and to record additional mortgages and satisfactions on the property, the trust was deemed to have constructive notice of the record in the recorder's office.

The insured was barred because she failed to commence her action within four years after the insurer’s last payment of no-fault benefits.

   Because a financial planning business is not an occupation that requires the specialized knowledge, long and intensive preparation in skills, and scholarly principles underlying such skills typically associated only with professions, the defendant’s business was one to which the six-year statute of limitations applied, rather than the two-year professional malpractice statute.

   The six-year statute of repose set forth in this section relating to medical malpractice actions does not violate equal protection because there is a close correspondence between the statutory classification and the goals of the legislature in adopting the statute.

   A cause of action for legal malpractice does not accrue, and the statute of limitations does not commence to run, until the client has incurred some damage. Wall v. Lewis, 366 N.W.2d 471, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 301</cite> (N.D. 1985); Binstock v. Tschider, 374 N.W.2d 81, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 397</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   Where attorney’s act of negligence allegedly caused client to incur additional tax liability, actual damage was incurred no later than when the IRS imposed a tax assessment, thereby creating an enforceable obligation against the client. Wall v. Lewis, 366 N.W.2d 471, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 301</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   The statute commences to run when the plaintiff knows, or with reasonable diligence should know, of (1) the injury, (2) its cause, and (3) the defendant’s possible negligence. Wall v. Lewis, 393 N.W.2d 758, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 415</cite> (N.D. 1986); Herzog v. Yuill, 399 N.W.2d 287, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Defendants claimed that a patient’s malpractice claim was time-barred, but the court determined that there were critical issues of material fact as to when the cause of action accrued; defendants claimed that the patient knew or should have discovered the potential claim on the date that the patient sought a second opinion, while the patient disagreed, arguing that under the discovery rule and because of a delayed healing of the fracture, knowledge of defendants’ malpractice did not become obvious until after the patient had completely recovered from corrective surgery. Schaaf v. Dahl, 327 F. Supp. 2d 1087, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14882 (D.N.D. 2004).

   In an action alleging defamation, false imprisonment, and other tort and civil rights claims arising from a divorce and felonious arrest incident, an appellate court had jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a dismissal of the case without prejudice because there was a consistent subsequent judgment that was intended to be final, some of the actions were time barred, and only hearing those actions on appeal would have split the case.

   Where farmer who brought action for interference with business alleged that defendants had committed arson in 1957 or 1958, an act of champerty in 1952, malicious prosecution in 1959 and assault upon his person in 1960, no continuing tort was established; rather each alleged wrongful act constituted separate cause of action and statute of limitations ran from time of commission of each act. Fox v. Higgins, 149 N.W.2d 369, 1967 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 873, 88 S. Ct. 160, 19 L. Ed. 2d 153, 1967 U.S. LEXIS 930 (U.S. 1967).

        Because defamation claims arising from statements made on a website were actionable in 1998, the single publication rule applied to the website, and there were no material modifications after 1998, the defamation claims filed in 2003 were barred by the two-year statute of limitations under N.D.C.C. § 28-01-18(1). Even though defendants were out of the country, the tolling provisions of N.D.C.C. § 28-01-32 did not apply because defendants were within the court’s long-arm jurisdiction.

   The purpose of the discovery rule is to prevent the injustice of barring a claim before the plaintiff could reasonably be aware of its existence. Thus, the focus is upon whether the plaintiff has been apprised of facts which would place a reasonable person on notice that a potential claim exists. It is not necessary that the plaintiff be subjectively convinced that he has been injured and that the injury was caused by the defendant’s negligence. Wall v. Lewis, 393 N.W.2d 758, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 415</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>

   Where plaintiffs were advised by an attorney that they had a potential malpractice claim, plaintiffs as a matter of law “discovered” the injury, its cause, and the defendant’s possible negligence as of that date. Wall v. Lewis, 393 N.W.2d 758, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 415</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>

   Because defamation claims arising from statements made to an Attorney General’s office were not reasonably discoverable until plaintiff made a specific request to the office, the discovery rule applied to the statements. As a result, the claims were not barred by the two-year statute of limitations of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-18" target="_self">28-01-18</a></cite>.

   Summary judgment for defendant attorneys in legal malpractice case was proper where plaintiff client filed his case outside the two-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions. Reasonable persons could not disagree that the client knew, or with reasonable diligence should have known, of any alleged malpractice by the attorneys and any potential injury by the time the judgment was entered against him in the divorce action in June 2001; the client commenced the action in October 2003, and it was therefore commenced outside the two-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions. Riemers v. Omdahl, 2004 ND 188, 687 N.W.2d 445, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 320</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>

   Client’s allegations about the attorney’s representation were to reduce or to avoid the attorney’s attempt to recover attorney fees for his representation of her; thus, her claim was a defensive recoupment and was not barred by the statute of limitations.

   District court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of an attorney after finding the statute of limitations had expired prior to the former client’s initiation of a malpractice claim where the action accrued on the date of the order finding the client breached his fiduciary duty to his sisters and reserving the determination of damages arising from the breach. Following the issuance of that order, reasonable minds could have drawn but one conclusion from the evidence: the client was on notice a potential claim against the attorney existed. Broten v.

   While this section itself does not spell out the professions which it covers, the legislative history of this section suggests that the legislature envisioned more than one profession in its concept of malpractice.

   The medical malpractice two-year statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff knows, or with reasonable diligence should know, of his injury, its cause, and the defendant’s possible negligence; provided however, that the limitation of an action against a physician or licensed hospital will not be extended beyond six years of the act or omission of alleged malpractice by a nondiscovery thereof. Anderson v. Shook, 333 N.W.2d 708, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 262</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>

   Medical malpractice actions must be commenced within two years of the discovery of the act or omission of alleged malpractice. This limitation begins to run when the plaintiff knows, or with reasonable diligence should know, of (1) the injury, (2) its cause, and (3) the defendant’s possible negligence. Wheeler v. Schmid Lab., 451 N.W.2d 133, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a medical malpractice action, where plaintiff knew his injury was caused by an extravasation which occurred during the venographic procedure and also knew that a medical technologist directly assisted the radiologist in conducting the procedure, a reasonable person exercising due diligence should have known of the possible negligence of the technician and anyone else associated with the procedure; more than two years elapsed from the time when plaintiff, as a matter of law, should have discovered technician’s alleged negligence, and therefore, his claim was barred. Zettel v. Licht, 518 N.W.2d 214, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 1994).

   Medical malpractice action filed more than two years after the cause of the patient’s back pain was determined to be fractured vertebrae and collapsed discs, contrary to the earlier diagnosis of fibrositis, was time-barred.

   Summary judgment was properly granted against a claim of medical malpractice based on the six-year statute of repose in this section where the act of alleged negligence occurred in 1992 and suit was not filed until 2001; this section did not violate the equal protection clause, and neither equitable estoppel nor the continuous rule applied to bar application of the statute. Hoffner v. Johnson, 2003 ND 79, 660 N.W.2d 909, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 2003).

   In a patient’s medical malpractice suit against an out-of-state company that provided an allegedly non-sterile tendon for his replacement surgery, because the company’s business of harvesting, preservation, and delivery of body parts involved science or art requiring special skills not ordinarily possessed by lay persons, the case was governed by the two-year statute of limitations for malpractice under subdivision (3) of this section. Beaudoin v. S. Tex. Blood &amp; Tissue Ctr., 2004 ND 49, 676 N.W.2d 103, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 2004).

   Summary judgment was properly granted in favor of a radiologist in a wrongful death action based on medical malpractice because the two-year time limitation began to run the day after a decedent had an allergic reaction and died during a routine testing procedure at a hospital; the record showed that a representative had notice of the incident on the day the test was performed. Long v. Jaszczak, 2004 ND 194, 688 N.W.2d 173, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 324</cite> (N.D. 2004).

   Summary judgment was properly awarded to doctors on parents’ wrongful birth claim because even if the claim was not barred by North Dakota law, it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-18" target="_self">28-01-18</a></cite>(3), for medical malpractice actions; the summons and complaint were not served on the doctors until May 5, 2009, which was more than two years after the child’s birth on April 12, 2007.

   District court did not err in holding that a mother’s malpractice claim against her daughter’s psychiatrist was time-barred by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-18" target="_self">28-01-18</a></cite>(4) where the earliest date facts occurred which would have placed a reasonable person on notice that a potential claim of medical malpractice existed was the day the mother was alerted her daughter had gone missing and the same day she learned of her daughter’s death. Since the mother had not filed suit within two years of that date, her claim was untimely. McCarthy v. Getz, 2019 ND 190, 930 N.W.2d 640, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>

   Case law applied an objective standard to determine the date the statute of limitations began to run in a wrongful death claim based on allegations of medical malpractice. That date was the date the plaintiff became aware that the medical treatment sought by the deceased had not gone as planned. McCarthy v. Getz, 2019 ND 190, 930 N.W.2d 640, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   Husband’s negligence claims were governed by the two-year statute of limitations for malpractice because the actual nature of his action was a hospital’s negligent provision of medical services to his wife; the question of whether the wife contracted hepatitis C due to a hospital’s alleged substandard phlebotomy services and failure to have proper drug diversion protocol involved science or art requiring special skills not ordinarily possessed by lay persons. Krebsbach v. Trinity Hosps., Inc., 2020 ND 24, 938 N.W.2d 133, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 24</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>

   Husband’s negligence claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations for malpractice because after receiving a letter from attorneys about a possible personal injury claim, the husband reasonably should have recognized the need to investigate a hospital’s possible negligence; the two-year malpractice statute of limitations expired before the husband moved to intervene in a lawsuit with other plaintiffs against the hospital. Krebsbach v. Trinity Hosps., Inc., 2020 ND 24, 938 N.W.2d 133, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 24</cite> (N.D. 2020).

      No action, defense, or counterclaim founded upon a right of homestead in property conveyed or encumbered, otherwise than as provided by the law in force at the time of the execution of such conveyance or encumbrance, and for which no declaration of homestead has been filed previous to the execution of such conveyance or encumbrance, is effectual or maintainable, unless such action is commenced, or such defense or counterclaim interposed, within two years after the execution of such conveyance or encumbrance. Such limitation does not apply if the homestead claimant, at the time of the execution of such conveyance or encumbrance, was in the actual possession of the property claimed and had not quit such possession previous to the commencement of such action, or the interposing of such defense or counterclaim.

   The possession of a county under a valid tax deed is not adverse to the former owner until notice of sale is given to record owners and this section does not apply during such time. Wittrock v. Weisz, 73 N.W.2d 355, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. 1955).

       <p>

   Since a county under a tax deed valid on its face, does not hold adversely to the former owner or his heirs who succeed to the title, the provisions of this section are not applicable to the period that the county holds title as its provisions are inconsistent with the right to redeem or repurchase while the county holds title to the property.

        Six-year limitations period under N.D.C.C. § 28-01-16, and not the 10-year period under N.D.C.C. § 28-01-22, was properly applied to breach of fiduciary duty and “freeze-out” claims brought by a minority owner in a limited liability company. The claims fell within N.D.C.C. § 28-01-16(2) because they were based on the North Dakota Limited Liability Company Act, N.D.C.C. §§ 10-32-01 et seq., which did not expressly provide a statute of limitations; the claims also fell within N.D.C.C. § 28-01-16(5), as they involved an alleged injury not arising from contract.

       Limitations on claims for relief fraudulently concealed.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When, by fraud or fraudulent concealment, a party against whom a claim for relief exists prevents the person in whose favor such claim for relief exists from obtaining knowledge thereof, the latter may commence an action within one year from the time the claim for relief is discovered by the latter or might have been discovered by the latter in the exercise of diligence. Such fraud or fraudulent concealment must be established to the satisfaction of the court or jury, as the case may be, by a fair preponderance of the evidence.

       Limitation on actions alleging childhood sexual abuse.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding section 28-01-25, a claim for relief resulting from childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within ten years after the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that a potential claim exists resulting from alleged childhood sexual abuse. For purposes of this section, “childhood sexual abuse” means any act committed by the defendant against the plaintiff which occurred when the plaintiff was under eighteen years of age and which would have been a violation of chapter 12.1-20 or 12.1-27.2. In a claim for relief under this section, the plaintiff is not required to establish which act in a continuous series of sexual abuse acts by the defendant caused the injury.

   Because a creditor’s claim for tort damages can be filed in a probate proceeding under Title 30.1, the death of a potential defendant before the period of the statute of limitations has run on a tort claim does not make § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-16" target="_self">28-01-16</a></cite> ineffective, and this section does not apply.

        The Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents, 20 U.S.T. 361, authorizes service by methods that do not involve the Dutch central authority, and the plaintiff could have used one of those methods instead of attempting service through the central authority; the Hague Convention was therefore not a statutory prohibition that could prevent plaintiff purchaser in a products liability suit from timely commencement of an action and this section was not applicable.

       <p>
        In a diversity action brought in district court, a healthcare corporation attempted to complete service of process on a Dutch medical corporation by serving the central authority, but under the plain language of N.D.C.C. § 28-01-38, which applied, the central authority was not the equivalent of a sheriff or county officer, and the action had not commenced. Moreover, the service on the central authority did not toll the statute of limitations; the corporation failed to pursue other alternatives available under The Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters, Nov. 15, 1965, T.I.A.S. No. 6638. Paracelsus Healthcare Corp. v. Philips Med. Sys., 384 F.3d 492, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 15911 (8th Cir. N.D. 2004).

     <p>
      If any person is out of this state at the time a claim for relief accrues against that person, an action on such claim for relief may be commenced in this state at any time within the term limited in this chapter for the bringing of an action on such claim for relief after the return of such person into this state. If any person departs from and resides out of this state and remains continuously absent therefrom for the space of one year or more after a claim for relief has accrued against that person, the time of that person’s absence may not be taken as any part of the time limited for the commencement of an action on such claim for relief. The provisions of this section, however, do not apply to the foreclosure of real estate mortgages by action or otherwise and do not apply if this state’s courts have jurisdiction over a person during the person’s absence.

        Because defamation claims arising from statements made on a website were actionable in 1998, the single publication rule applied to the website, and there were no material modifications after 1998, the defamation claims filed in 2003 were barred by the two-year statute of limitations under N.D.C.C. § 28-01-18(1). Even though defendants were out of the country, the tolling provisions of N.D.C.C. § 28-01-32 did not apply because defendants were within the court’s long-arm jurisdiction.

   North Dakota’s legislature has not specifically provided an exception to the tolling statute because of substituted service of process on a nonresident motorist. Loken v. Magrum, 380 N.W.2d 336, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   Because plaintiff’s claim against defendant arose as a tort, service by publication was a permissible means to effectuate service of process and the courts of North Dakota had jurisdiction over defendant even in her absence from the state. Therefore, this section did not toll the six-year statute of limitations and plaintiff’s action was properly dismissed by the district court with prejudice. Lupo v.

   To allow an oral acknowledgment or promise to toll the statute of limitations would render the “writing signed by the party to be charged” phrase of this section meaningless; thus, this section requires a written acknowledgment or promise of a new or continuing contract for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations. Kadrmas, Lee &amp; Jackson, P.C. v. Bolken, 508 N.W.2d 341, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 1993).

   Where there was no mutual oral agreement established either by customer’s failure to object to bills sent or by written acknowledgment of balance due, as required by this section, limitation of time for bringing action to recover balance due on account was not extended. Hansen v. Fettig, 179 N.W.2d 739, 1970 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1970).

       <p>

   A partial payment of a joint or joint and several obligation tolls the limitations as to the obligor requesting or directing payment. Roles v. Roles, 58 N.D. 310, 225 N.W. 809, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 1929).

   Partial payments that are voluntary, free from uncertainty as to the identity of the debt, and made and accepted as partial payment of the larger debt under circumstances consistent with an intent to pay the entire debt, toll the statute of limitations for the entire debt. Kadrmas, Lee &amp; Jackson, P.C. v. Bolken, 508 N.W.2d 341, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 1993).

   The execution of a renewal note is an acknowledgment of the debt within the meaning of the statute so as to take action on the note out of the operation of the six-year limitation statute, where the action was brought within six years from the time the renewal note was due. Hoffman v. Ness, 71 N.D. 283, 300 N.W. 428, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>

   An action on a promissory note was barred by statute of limitations where holder relied upon a written acknowledgment or promise to pay the debt which showed that the debtor was unable to pay, and merely intimated that he might pay or renew the debt if certain conditions were fulfilled. Huus v. Huus, 75 N.D. 392, 28 N.W.2d 385, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1947).

   Renewal note executed by debtor sufficiently recognized the debt to avoid the operation of the statute of limitations. Pear v. Grand Forks Motel Assocs., 553 N.W.2d 774, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 222</cite> (N.D. 1996).

   Allowance of the wife’s claim against the estate for a promissory note was reversed because there was no evidence of a promise to extend the time for payment, or to forebear suit under the promissory note, much less a written promise or acknowledgment to extend the statute of limitations, and the wife had cited no authority to support her assertion that the statute of limitations was tolled by her forbearance during the couple’s marriage; the promissory note was executed in March 1980 and stated it was due in March 1985, the decedent died in June 2004, and the decedent had not made any payments on the note when he died in 2004.

   Where the contestants’ attorney gave the papers to the sheriff’s office on the fourteenth day, the attorney’s actions throughout that day demonstrated a faithful and diligent effort to procure service on the contestees, a named contestee was timely served and the action was timely filed, and after filing and delivery to the sheriff’s office during the last hour of the business day, service was promptly completed the next morning, the contestants delivered the papers to the sheriff’s office with a bona fide intent that they be served as soon as reasonably possible in compliance with this section.

   Summary judgment was properly awarded to doctors on parents’ wrongful birth claim because even if the claim was not barred by North Dakota law, it was barred by the two-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions; the summons and complaint were not served on the doctors until May 5, 2009, which was more than two years after the child’s birth on April 12, 2007.

   Insurance company, limited partnership, and rental company’s action for negligence and strict liability was timely filed where they faxed the summons and complaint to the relevant sheriff’s office within six years of the action accruing, and where they met the requirement of

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-38" target="_self">28-01-38</a></cite> that they intended those documents to be served on the elevator company that they were suing. Under that statute, the sheriff was authorized to serve that process and it did not matter that the service occurred in Wisconsin where the elevator company was located, as the service was made in accordance with N.D.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1) allowing service to be made outside the state so long as that service complied with service as if it was being made in North Dakota.

      No action or proceeding may be maintained by a person out of possession to cancel or enforce any contract for the sale or conveyance of real estate, after twenty years from the date of said contract, as shown by the record of such instrument, or after twenty years from the date of recording of any instrument which describes or refers to such contract, which itself is not of record, unless the record of such contract or other instrument shows that less than ten years have elapsed since the due date of the last payment on the indebtedness or part thereof, secured thereby, or since the claim for relief has accrued thereon, or unless the record shows an extension of the maturity of the instrument or of the debt or a part thereof, and that ten years from the expiration of the time of such extension has not yet expired. The limitation of this section may not be extended by the nonresidence of any plaintiff or defendant or of any vendor or vendee, nor by reason of any payment made after the due date of the last payment on the indebtedness or part thereof, nor by reason of any disability of any party interested in the contract.

However, if less than 10 years have elapsed from the due date of the last payment, the accrual of the right of action, or the expiration of the maturity date on the instrument or debt, then the action to cancel may be brought more than 20 years from the date of the contract.

   Disparate treatment under this section of persons who furnish the design, planning, supervision or construction of an improvement on one hand, and material suppliers or owners of an improvement on the other, did not contravene Art. I, § 21, N.D. Const., where differences in control of property made the classifications reasonable. Bellemare v. Gateway Builders, 420 N.W.2d 733, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   This section does not relate only to particular persons or things of a class. It operates alike on all persons and property similarly situated. Reasonable classification does not violate Art. IV, § 13, N.D. Const. The classifications made by this section have not been shown to be unreasonable and do not violate the “special law” provisions of N.D. Const., Art. IV, § 13. Bellemare v.

   It was unnecessary to define the term “improvement to real property” because only one conclusion — that the grain bin was an improvement to real property — could reasonably be drawn, where the bin was a 10,000-bushel bin anchored to a cement slab by bolts, with a perforated floor nine inches above the cement slab upon which the bin rested, part of a grain-handling system which also consisted of two additional 10,000-bushel bins, a 3,500-bushel overhead bin, two hopper bins, and a leg, and since the bin was erected in 1967, the owner had never moved it or removed any of the anchors.

       <p>

   In enacting this section the Legislature’s intention was to limit what would otherwise be virtually unlimited and perpetual exposure to liability for persons engaged in the design, planning, supervision or observation of construction or construction of improvements to real property without eliminating liability entirely by affording a reasonable period within which defects might be manifested and suits brought for injuries caused by defects.

   There is a close correspondence between the statutory classification of persons injured within 10 years after substantial completion and persons injured more than 10 years after substantial completion and the legislative goals.

   The right to recover for personal injuries is an important substantive right for which the appropriate standard by which to review limiting legislation is the intermediate standard or the close correspondence test. That intermediate standard of review requires a close correspondence between statutory classification and legislative goals. Because the statute of repose contained in this section also affects the right to recover for personal injuries, the Supreme Court will apply the intermediate standard of review. Bellemare v. Gateway Builders, 420 N.W.2d 733, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1988).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any action for injury or death alleging professional negligence by a physician, nurse, hospital, or nursing, basic, or assisted living facility licensed by this state or by any other health care organization, including an ambulatory surgery center or group of physicians operating a clinic or outpatient care facility, must be dismissed without prejudice on motion unless the plaintiff serves upon the defendant an affidavit containing an admissible expert opinion to support a prima facie case of professional negligence within three months of the commencement of the action. The court may set a later date for serving the affidavit for good cause shown by the plaintiff if the plaintiff’s request for an extension of time is made before the expiration of the three-month period following commencement of the action. The expert’s affidavit must identify the name and business address of the expert, indicate the expert’s field of expertise, and contain a brief summary of the basis for the expert’s opinion. This section does not apply to unintentional failure to remove a foreign substance from within the body of a patient, or performance of a medical procedure upon the wrong patient, organ, limb, or other part of the patient’s body, or other obvious occurrence.

   This section does not have retroactive application to those causes of action which arose before it was enacted. Fortier v. Traynor, 330 N.W.2d 513, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1983).

   Trial court erred in entering summary judgment dismissing a wrongful death action against a nursing home for failure to provide an expert opinion within three months to support the allegations of professional negligence; the time limit applies only to actions against a physician, nurse, or hospital. Van Klootwyk v. Baptist Home, Inc., 2003 ND 112, 665 N.W.2d 679, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2003).

   District court erred when it applied the 2005 version of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-46" target="_self">28-01-46</a></cite> in effect on the commencement date of a patient’s action since the applicable law in malpractice actions was the law in effect when the cause of action arose. Unless the amendments to § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-46" target="_self">28-01-46</a></cite> were retroactive, the district court should have used the date the cause of action accrued in its analysis rather than the commencement date of the action, and nothing in the statute suggested the amendments were intended to apply retroactively; because the injury date occurred on February 10, 2004, and the statute was not retroactive, the 1997 version of § 28-01-46 should have been applied.

   Because the patient and her spouse did not obtain an admissible expert’s opinion as required by this section and the negligent act at issue did not fall within the statute’s obvious occurrence exception, they failed to meet this section’s requirements as a matter of law; however, the patient’s and spouse’s claim for lack of informed consent fell within the statutory exception and the trial court improperly dismissed that claim without a hearing. Holman v. Berglund, 2003 ND 103, 664 N.W.2d 516, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 2003).

   Under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-46" target="_self">28-01-46</a></cite>, a plaintiff had to show good cause before the case was dismissed, but because a defendant might file a motion to dismiss well after the 3-month period lapsed, and because the plaintiff had the right to respond to that motion, the latest a plaintiff could show good cause would be in response to the motion to dismiss; thus, a trial court ought not to have dismissed a suit where the plaintiff filed her good cause motion after the defendants moved to dismiss more than 3 months subsequent to the commencement of the suit.

   Scheer v. Altru Health Sys., 2007 ND 104, 734 N.W.2d 778, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 92</cite> (N.D. 2007).

   Supreme court exercised its supervisory jurisdiction because the district court’s decision denying the motion to dismiss filed by a doctor and a medical practice was contrary to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-46" target="_self">28-01-46</a></cite> and the supreme court’s precedent.

   Dismissal of malpractice claim was inappropriate because the affidavit of a doctor served the purpose of ensuring that the claim was not frivolous or unsupported as it was inferable that the doctor’s opinion on the standard of care was that a physician should have warned a patient that the patient’s vision did not meet the legal standard to drive. The affidavit did not need to state expressly that adequate vision was required to safely drive and that a driver whose vision did not meet legal standards would foreseeably cause driving accidents. Cichos v. Dakota Eye Inst., P.C., 2019 ND 234, 933 N.W.2d 452, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 239</cite> (N.D. 2019).

   District court’s dismissal of medical malpractice action based on plaintiff’s failure to secure an admissible medical opinion supporting his malpractice claim more than three years after filing the action was not error. Larson v. Hetland, 1999 ND 98, 593 N.W.2d 785, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>
        Where plaintiff failed to file an expert opinion affidavit within the three month period provided for by this section, and also failed to request an extension of time based on “good cause” prior to defendant’s filing a motion to dismiss, District Court did not err in dismissing plaintiff’s case without prejudice. Weasel v. St. Alexius Med. Ctr., 230 F.3d 348, 2000 U.S. App. LEXIS 25481 (8th Cir. N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the plaintiff did not file an expert affidavit to support the allegations of professional negligence against defendants within the three-month period or within the extended period under this section, the court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, treating it as a motion to dismiss, because under this section dismissal without prejudice is the appropriate remedy for failure to disclose an expert witness. Schaaf v. Dahl, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23452 (D.N.D. Dec. 31, 2003).

       <p>
        Patient’s motion for an extension of time to file an expert report in her medical malpractice action against the United States of America, acting through the Department of Interior, Indian Health Services (IHS), was denied where it was undisputed that the patient: (1) did not file an expert witness affidavit within the three-month period set forth in this section; (2) did not seek to extend the three-month deadline prior to the expiration of the limitations period; and (3) sought an extension only after IHS filed a motion for summary judgment. The patient’s assertion that she had a difficult time communicating with one of her proposed experts who did not return her calls did not excuse the delay of nearly seven months before the patient sought an extension of the expert disclosure period. Vallee v. United States, — F. Supp. 2d —, U.S. Dist. LEXIS (D.N.D. May 21, 2004).

        In a medical malpractice case brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act,
        28 USCS § 1346,
        2671- 2680, North Dakota law applied to the case, even though the injury occurred on an Indian reservation, because a mother failed to show that there was any applicable tribal law; further, a motion for summary judgment filed by several health care providers and the United States was granted because the mother failed to file an expert affidavit within three months of the commencement of the action, no motion for a good cause extension was filed on a timely basis, and the obvious occurrence exception did not apply to a head injury suffered by a child.
        LaFramboise v. Thompson, 329 F. Supp. 2d 1054, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16640 (D.N.D. 2004).
       </p>

   District court did not err in granting defendant physician summary judgment on plaintiff’s medical negligence claim; plaintiff failed to produce expert evidence regarding the applicable standard of care.

   Johnson v. Bronson, 2013 ND 78, 830 N.W.2d 595, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court properly dismissed a patient's medical negligence action against a surgeon because, while her attorney disclosed the existence of an expert witness willing to testify on the patient's behalf in a letter to the surgeon's attorney, the patient failed to serve the surgeon with an affidavit from an expert as required by statute, the injury the patient suffered as a result of the surgeon's alleged negligence did not fall under the “obvious occurrence” exception in the statute where the occurrence that led to the result, not the result itself, had to be obvious, and the technical surgical procedure was beyond the understanding of a layperson.

   Greene v. Matthys, 2017 ND 107, 893 N.W.2d 179, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 2017).

   Because the personal representative failed to serve an affidavit containing an admissible expert opinion supporting a prima facie case of professional negligence within three months of the commencement of the medical malpractice action and failed to request an extension of the time period to serve the affidavit within the three months as required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01s28-01-46" target="_self">28-01-46</a></cite>, the action was proper dismissed.

   The legislative history of this section does not indicate an intent to limit the requirement of expert witnesses to professional negligence actions involving physicians, nurses, and hospitals, nor does it reveal an intent to expand the definition of “physician”; rather, the legislative history indicates that this section is designed simply to minimize frivolous claims against physicians, nurses, and hospitals. Heimer v. Privratsky, 434 N.W.2d 357, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        “Obvious occurrence” exception to this section did not apply to a patient’s medical malpractice action, which was based on the failure to properly diagnose her radiculopathy, a tumor in her kidney and gallstones, because the patient’s claims of professional negligence were beyond the understanding of the ordinary layperson. Vallee v. United States, — F. Supp. 2d —, U.S. Dist. LEXIS (D.N.D. May 21, 2004).

   Patient did not file an expert witness affidavit within three months of commencing the action, and the district court clearly erred in concluding the obvious occurrence exception applied because the alleged occurrence of professional negligence was not plainly within the knowledge of a layperson; a layperson could not find negligence without the benefit of expert testimony.

       Waiver of privilege for health care providers and informal discussion.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A party who commences an action for malpractice, error, mistake, or failure to cure, whether based on contract or tort, against a health care provider, as defined in section 32-42-01, or a health care facility, on the person’s own behalf or in a representative capacity, waives in that action any privilege existing under rule 503 of the North Dakota Rules of Evidence, as to any medical records, opinions, or other information in the possession of any other health care provider who has examined or cared for the party or other person whose health or medical condition has been placed in controversy in the action. The waiver must permit all defendants to the action, and their attorneys or authorized representatives, to examine the medical records, opinions, or other information and informally participate in a discussion with the health care provider, if the provider consents, regarding the medical records, opinions, or other information that appear reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence as to any element of the action or the defense of the action. Any statements made by a health care provider during an informal discussion are not admissible, directly or by reference in direct or cross-examination of any witness, in any administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding. However, this section does not render inadmissible any statements obtained from the health care provider in discovery or any legal proceedings independent of the informal discussion which are otherwise admissible in the administrative, civil, or criminal proceeding.
     </p>
     <p>
      The plaintiff’s attorney or authorized representative must have the opportunity to be present at any informal discussion. This requirement is satisfied if the defendant’s attorney serves a written notice on the plaintiff’s attorney at least fifteen days prior to the informal discussion stating the time, date, and location of the informal discussion. If the plaintiff’s attorney, after consultation with the defendant’s attorney, is unable to attend the discussion at the time or on the date specified in the notice or at some other agreed-upon date and time, the court in which the action is pending shall, upon motion of any party before the date specified in the notice, hold a scheduling conference to set a date and time for the informal discussion that will best serve the convenience of the parties and the health care provider and the interests of justice. Appropriate authorizations permitting access to the written medical record, informal discussion, and testimony at a deposition or trial must be provided by the party commencing the action at the time the action is commenced. If the party commencing the action fails to provide appropriate authorizations at the time the action is commenced, the health care provider or health care facility may use other means to obtain the records such as by subpoena or by seeking a court order. If alternative means to obtain a patient’s records are used, the court shall award reasonable costs incurred by the health care provider or health care facility in obtaining those records, including reasonable attorney’s fees.

       The legislative assembly finds that it is in the interest of the general public, particularly those persons who may bring claims regarding materials containing asbestos in public buildings and those against whom the claims may be brought, to set a specific date by which public building owners must bring a cause of action for removal or other abatement costs associated with the presence of asbestos in their buildings. By enactment of this statute of limitations, the legislative assembly does not imply that suits would otherwise be barred by an existing limitations period.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-01s28-01-47ol12">
       Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, any action to recover costs for removal and replacement of asbestos or materials containing asbestos from a public building; to recover costs for other measures taken to locate, correct, or ameliorate any problem related to asbestos in a public building; or for reimbursement for removal and replacement, correction, or amelioration of an asbestos problem in a public building, must be commenced prior to August 1, 1997. Any such action which would otherwise be barred before August 1, 1997, as a result of expiration of the applicable period of limitation, is revived or extended. An asbestos action revived or extended under this subsection must be commenced prior to August 1, 1997.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-01s28-01-47ol13">
       For purposes of this section, “public building” means any building owned by any county, city, township, school district, park district, or any other unit of local government, the state or any agency, industry, institution, board, or department thereof.

   When a defective product causes damage to persons or other property, the interests at stake are health and safety which are protected under tort law which allows recovery by injured plaintiffs against a seller or manufacturer of an unreasonably dangerous defective product under this chapter. When, however, a product is defective and damages only itself, the interest at stake is the purchaser’s expectation of receiving the bargained-for product; that interest is protected by the remedies provided under Art. 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, N.D.C.C. ch. 41-02.

   Tort actions under the Products Liability Act can be brought when a defective product causes damage to persons or other property, but are not available to any plaintiff when only the defective product itself has been damaged.

   Evidence was sufficient to support finding that company which distributed a product was a “seller” where another company manufactured the product, the company never had physical possession of the product, and while design changes were to be authorized by the company, it did little more than place its private label on the product. Winkler v. Gilmore &amp; Tatge Mfg. Co., 334 N.W.2d 837, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 334</cite> (N.D. 1983).

        In an action brought by the surviving spouse of a deceased heavy construction equipment operator who was killed when a nine-wheel pneumatic rubber tire roller compactor he was operating rolled over, the court denied summary judgment to the seller and the distributor on the spouse’s strict products liability claim because (1) the distributor had held itself as the manufacturer of the compactor, so it was a manufacturer under N.D.C.C. § 28-01.3-01(1); (2) the seller was not entitled to dismissal under N.D.C.C. § 28-01.3-04 as the non-manufacturing seller of the compactor because there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the seller’s decision to stock the compactor without a rollover protective structure (ROPS) was an element of its design, whether the seller had actual knowledge of the product defect, and whether it created the defect which caused the death; (3) there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the purchaser, the decedent’s employer, was aware of the option to purchase a ROPS and made the conscious decision to not do so; (4) there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the lack of a ROPS was a defect which rendered the compactor unreasonably dangerous or dangerous to an extent beyond which was contemplated by the ordinary and prudent buyer or user and beyond that contemplated by the purchaser, its employees, or the decedent pursuant to N.D.C.C. §§ 28-01.3-06, 28-01.3-01(4); and (5) the spouse’s expert opined that the decedent’s injuries were proximately caused by the lack of a seat belt and ROPS.

   Specificity included in the legislature’s adoption of N.D.C.C. ch. 28-01.3 indicates the clear message that it intended to restrict, rather than expand, the availability of product liability actions as a remedy for personal injury, death or property damage arising out of use of defective products. In a products liability case brought against the seller of a meat grinder, the Supreme Court of North Dakota declined to adopt the “apparent manufacturer” doctrine, because the products liability act curtailed liability of a “nonmanufacturing seller” under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01.3s28-01.3-04" target="_self">28-01.3-04</a></cite> and controlled over any conflicting common law doctrine.

   Cautionary language relied on by manufacturer of handgun did not convey a warning that anything would be “blown back” forcefully enough to cause a serious injury, and the trial court could reasonably find a generic warning from a group of weapon manufacturers of the possibility that a rare rupture could cause objects to be blown back to the shooter’s face would not give plaintiff actual knowledge that this type of accident could occur with the handgun manufactured by defendant.

        Apparent Manufacturer Doctrine.

      <p>

   In a products liability case brought against the seller of a meat grinder, the Supreme Court of North Dakota declined to adopt the “apparent manufacturer” doctrine, because the products liability act curtailed liability of a “nonmanufacturing seller” under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-01.3s28-01.3-04" target="_self">28-01.3-04</a></cite> and controlled over any conflicting common law doctrine.

      If a product liability action is commenced against a seller, and it is alleged that a product was defectively designed, contained defectively manufactured parts, had insufficient safety guards, or had inaccurate or insufficient warning; that such condition existed when the product left the control of the manufacturer; that the seller has not substantially altered the product; and that the defective condition or lack of safety guards or adequate warnings caused the injury or damage complained of; the manufacturer from whom the product was acquired by the seller must be required to assume the cost of defense of the action, and any liability that may be imposed on the seller. The obligation to assume the seller’s cost of defense should also extend to an action in which the manufacturer and seller are ultimately found not liable.

   The comparative negligence provisions of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.09.html#t09c9-10s9-10-07" target="_blank">9-10-07</a></cite> are not applicable to a products liability action; however, when the defenses of assumption of risk and unforeseeable misuse are raised in the context of a strict products-liability action, the trier of fact must determine, on a pure comparative-causation basis and not on the modified comparative negligence provisions of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.09.html#t09c9-10s9-10-07" target="_blank">9-10-07</a></cite>, the percent of the injuries proximately caused by the assumption of risk or the unforeseeable misuse and the percent proximately caused by the unreasonably dangerous defect in the product, and the plaintiff’s recovery must be reduced by an amount proportionate to the damage caused by the misuse or assumption of the risk. Thus, plaintiff’s misuse of the product will reduce the recovery by the percentage of damage attributable to the misuse but, even though equal to or greater than the causation attributable to the defective condition of the product, will not act as a total bar to plaintiff’s claim. Mauch v. Mfrs. Sales &amp; Serv., 345 N.W.2d 338, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 1984).

   In the present enactment of this statute of repose, there is no evidence demonstrating a close correspondence between the legislative goals and the classification which bars claims for damages caused by defective products after 10 years from the initial date of their purchase or 11 years from the date of their manufacture, irrespective of whether the injury is incurred within or beyond the period of repose; therefore, this statute creates an unconstitutional classification in violation of N.D.

     <p>
      An aviation manufacturer or seller of aircraft or aircraft components may not be held liable for any personal injury, death, or damage to property sustained as a result of an alleged defect in a state-of-the-art product. An aircraft or aircraft component is presumed to be a state-of-the-art product if the plaintiff cannot show by a preponderance of the evidence that a safer aircraft or aircraft component was on the market at the time of manufacture. No evidence of subsequent design or modification of an aircraft or aircraft component is admissible to prove that an aircraft or aircraft component is not a state-of-the-art product. The state-of-the-art comparisons must be made to products with similar-intended utility. The trier of the fact shall consider the defense that the designer’s choice averted greater peril for a large subclass of intended users and shall consider the economic viability of the component or product.

      When an infant is plaintiff, a guardian ad litem may be appointed upon the application of the infant if the infant is at least fourteen years of age. If the infant is under that age, the application may be made by the infant’s guardian or conservator, if the infant has one, or by a relative or friend of the infant. If the application is made by a relative or friend, notice thereof must be given to the guardian or conservator, if there is one, and if not, then to the person with whom the infant resides.

     <p>
      When an infant is defendant and resides in this state, a guardian ad litem may be appointed upon the application of the infant if the infant is at least fourteen years of age and applies within twenty days after the service of the summons. If the infant is under the age of fourteen years or neglects so to apply, then the application may be made by any other party to the action or by a relative or friend of the infant. If the application is not made by the infant, notice thereof must be given to the infant’s guardian or conservator, if the infant has either, and if not, then to the infant if the infant is at least fourteen years of age, and if the infant is under that age, then to the person with whom such infant resides.

     <p>
      In actions for the partition of real property or for the foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien, and in all actions affecting the title to real property, and in all other actions wherein an infant is a proper or necessary party and such infant resides out of this state, a guardian ad litem may be appointed upon application of the plaintiff. In such case, the court shall make its order designating some suitable person to be the guardian for the infant defendant for the purposes of the action unless the infant, or someone on the infant’s behalf, shall procure the appointment of another guardian for such infant within such time after the service of the order as the court therein may fix. The order must contain special directions for the manner of its service, which may be upon the infant or upon any relative or other person with whom the infant resides, and may be either by mail or by personal service upon the person designated.

     <p>
      When the defendant, at the time the action is commenced, is a person of unsound mind, and no guardian or conservator has been appointed, the court shall appoint a guardian for the defendant for the purposes of the action. If during the pendency of an action either party becomes or proves to be of unsound mind, the action may be prosecuted or defended by the party’s guardian or conservator in like manner as if it had been commenced after the appointment of the guardian or conservator, or the court may appoint a guardian for the action as the case may require. Such guardian for the action may be appointed upon the application of any party thereto or any relative or friend of the person of unsound mind after at least five days’ notice of such application first has been given to such person personally, if a resident of this state, and if not a resident, in such manner as the court shall direct. Upon the hearing of such application, the court, if deemed desirable and practicable, may order such person of unsound mind to appear personally or to be brought in by the sheriff.

   If an answer indicates that a third party is the real party in interest, and if such party is incompetent, he may be considered a party so as to authorize his appearance by guardian ad litem.

   A district court or judge may appoint a guardian ad litem for a mentally incompetent person, upon the application of any party thereto, or any relative or friend. Bucholz v. Harthun, 61 N.D. 547, 239 N.W. 161, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 306</cite> (N.D. 1931).

     <ol>
      <li id="t28c28-04s28-04-01ol11">

   It is proper to change the place of trial to the county of residence of private and corporate defendants upon the joint demand of both. Farmers' Sec. Bank v. Springen, 48 N.D. 364, 184 N.W. 664, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where the record did not show that the defendant domestic corporation was transacting business in Hettinger County, where action was commenced, it was entitled to a change of venue to Grand Forks County where its office and place of business were located. Griffin v. Implement Dealers' Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 62 N.D. 21, 241 N.W. 75, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>

   Subject to the court’s statutory power to change venue, an action against a domestic corporation is triable in the county designated in the complaint, if the corporation at the time of commencement of the action is transacting business therein. Baird v. Agricultural Credit Corp., 64 N.D. 426, 253 N.W. 68, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where a defendant domestic corporation and an individual defendant are both residents of the same county, there exists a statutory right to venue the case to that county, which should not be disturbed except for good cause. Bartholomay v. St. Thomas Lumber Co., 124 N.W.2d 481, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1963).

   An action against a domestic corporation may be tried in a county other than the county of its residence, if the corporation is transacting business in such county at the time the action was commenced. Baird v. Agricultural Credit Corp., 64 N.D. 426, 253 N.W. 68, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 1934); City of Granville v.

   Waterworks contractor was transacting business in county, although it had ceased construction work, during the period that it guaranteed the workmanship and materials to the municipality.

   Where the proper county for trial is that of the defendant’s residence, the defendant’s right to trial therein is absolute if asserted within time and in the manner provided by statute. Springer v. Paulson, 72 N.D. 560, 9 N.W.2d 440, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1943).

   A change of venue in an action against a railroad will not be granted for the convenience of defendant's witnesses if witnesses for the plaintiff would be inconvenienced thereby.

   When a demand for a change of venue, based upon the residence of defendants in another county, has been made within the time required by law, the right to change is absolute and not subject to the court’s discretion. State v. Bloom, 49 N.D. 224, 190 N.W. 812, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 44</cite> (N.D. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>

   A defendant has an absolute right to an order changing the place of trial to the county of his residence. Clark v. Cleveland, 60 N.D. 460, 235 N.W. 342, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>

   In an action on a note, where a defendant served written demand for a change of venue before the time for answer expired, he has an absolute right to have trial in the county where he resides, and such right is not affected by the substitution of the defendant’s administratrix as a party defendant on death of the defendant. First Nat'l Bank v. Rohlik, 66 N.D. 72, 262 N.W. 458, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>

   Under the statutes relating to the place of trial of a civil action, the right of a defendant to have the place of trial changed to the proper county is absolute, if proper demand therefor is duly made. Ruchverg v. Russell, 71 N.D. 658, 3 N.W.2d 459, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>

   Defendant was entitled to change of venue as matter of right where action, properly triable in county of defendant’s residence, was begun in another county and proper demand for change of place of trial was made. American State Bank v. Hoffelt, 236 N.W.2d 895, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where an action, properly triable in the county of the defendant’s residence, is begun in another county, the defendant on proper demand is entitled to a change of venue as a matter of right. Keating v. Keating, 399 N.W.2d 872, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1987).

   An order granting a motion for change of venue requires N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 54(b) certification to invoke the supreme court’s appellate jurisdiction. Western Coop. Credit Union v. Hagemeister, 454 N.W.2d 531, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1990).

   The action of the trial court in granting an application for a change of venue sought after the defendant has answered will not be disturbed by the reviewing court unless an abuse of sound judicial discretion is shown. Springer v. Paulson, 72 N.D. 560, 9 N.W.2d 440, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1943).

   It is proper to change the place of trial to the county of residence of private and corporate defendants, upon the joint demand of both. Farmers' Sec. Bank v. Springen, 48 N.D. 364, 184 N.W. 664, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where a defendant domestic corporation and an individual defendant are residents of the same county, there exists a statutory right to venue the case to that county, which should not be disturbed except for good cause. Bartholomay v. St. Thomas Lumber Co., 124 N.W.2d 481, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1963).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   A motion to change the place of trial to the proper county is not properly resisted by a showing that the convenience of witnesses will be subserved by trial in the county in which the action was begun; proper practice requires such showing to be presented in support of a motion in the court in which defendants have right to have case heard; where defendant has absolute right to change of venue to county of his residence, an order denying seasonable change of venue motion cannot be supported on ground of convenience of witnesses. American State Bank v. Hoffelt, 236 N.W.2d 895, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>

   The court may change the place of trial to promote the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice. However, proper practice requires such showing to be presented in the court in which the defendant has a right to have the case heard. Keating v.

   The statutory right to a trial in the defendant’s home county is a significant factor in determining venue and should not be denied except for good cause. Porth v. Glasoe, 522 N.W.2d 439, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>

   Fact that husband was an inmate at the state penitentiary in Burleigh County when wife brought action for divorce in her county of residence did not constitute sufficient ground to change the venue of the divorce action from wife’s county of residence to Burleigh County. Shulze v. Shulze, 322 N.W.2d 250, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 321</cite> (N.D. 1982).

       </p>
       <p>

   The plaintiff suing a nonresident corporation on an insurance policy may lay the venue in any county, and the party interpleaded subsequently is not entitled to a change of venue because he is not a resident of the county in which suit was begun. Dillage v. Lincoln Nat'l Life Ins. Co., 54 N.D. 312, 209 N.W. 656, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1926).

   The right of a nonresident defendant to a change of the place of trial constitutes a substantial right which cannot be defeated by the fraudulent joinder of a resident defendant. Guaranty Corp. v.

   Where the district court stated that the pre-trial publicity was not inherently prejudicial, but recognized the likelihood that “some polarization” still existed since there was ample evidence presented to the district court to suggest that “some polarization” still existed, the district court did not err in concluding that polarization resulted from the publicity.

   The court did not abuse its discretion in making an order changing the venue for convenience of witnesses where plaintiff’s application was based upon the files in the case and affidavit of plaintiff’s managing agent, stating names of witnesses, their residence, and that they were necessary, and such statements were not controverted by defendant. Robertson Lumber Co. v. Jones, 13 N.D. 112, 99 N.W. 1082, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 24</cite> (N.D. 1904).

   This section presupposes that a trial judge will consider the convenience of witnesses and the saving of expense in granting a change of venue, but it does not require all actions to be sent to an adjoining county for trial.

   A motion for a change of place of trial for the convenience of witnesses and to promote the ends of justice is addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the trial court. Curren v.

   A change of venue in an action against a railroad will not be granted for the convenience of defendant’s witnesses if witnesses for the plaintiff would be inconvenienced thereby. Crosby v.

   Court did not err in denying application for a change of place of trial for the convenience of witnesses where record showed that means of communication were ample, the answer was served in April, and application for change was made on November 15, 1928, just prior to the trial of the case on November 26, 1928.

   Where one defendant made a credible support for a change of venue for the convenience of witnesses, a number of witnesses lived in the county to which the change was proposed, and there was no counter-showing by the other parties, refusal to grant the motion was an abuse of discretion. Barkman v. Quam, 123 N.W.2d 824, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 113</cite> (N.D. 1963).

   It was within the trial court’s discretion to deny a change of venue for convenience of witnesses, from county of defendants’ residence to county where the accident occurred, where some of the witnesses resided in defendants’ county and where there might not have been a fair trial in the county where the accident occurred. Bartholomay v. St. Thomas Lumber Co., 124 N.W.2d 481, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1963).

       <p>

   A motion to change the place of trial to the proper county is not properly resisted by a showing that the convenience of witnesses will be subserved by trial in the county in which the action was begun; proper practice requires such showing to be presented in support of a motion in the court in which defendants have right to have case heard; where defendant has absolute right to change of venue to county of his residence, an order denying seasonable change of venue motion cannot be supported on ground of convenience of witnesses. American State Bank v. Hoffelt, 236 N.W.2d 895 (N.D. 1975), following Clark v. Cleveland, 60 N.D. 460, 235 N.W. 342, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 1931).

   Where the affidavit in support of plaintiff’s motion for a change of venue for the convenience of witnesses suggested that the primary reason for seeking the change was to permit the action to be consolidated with six related ones then pending in the county to which transfer was sought, the supreme court said that such a reason was not sufficient to justify the change, because upon transfer and consolidation, the defendants in the other six actions would become parties, and under established law the convenience of parties was not a criterion which could be considered in deciding the motion. American State Bank v. Hoffelt, 246 N.W.2d 484, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1976).

   Affidavits and memorandum brief submitted in support of plaintiff’s motion for a change of venue on ground on convenience of witnesses which stated that plaintiff’s medical expert witnesses would be inconvenienced and unable to testify where trial originally venued and that plaintiff was a quadriplegic and would be inconvenienced if trial held where originally venued did not set forth with requisite specificity the facts necessary to show exceptional circumstances which would justify a change of venue. Marshall v. Beach, 294 N.W.2d 623, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 1980).

   The court may change the place of trial to promote the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice.

   The fact that a number of persons in any part of a county have a bias or prejudice against the defendant in a civil action in such county will not justify a change of venue against the objection of the adverse party, if, notwithstanding such bias and objection, a fair and impartial trial can be had in that county.

   A motion for change of place of trial of an action, on the ground that there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had in the county where the action was brought, is addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the trial court, and the ruling of the trial court on such motion will not be reversed, the absence of a manifest abuse of such discretion.

   Fact that a major city of a county is a defendant in a district court action and that prospective jurors include taxpayers of the defendant city is insufficient to show that plaintiff can not receive a fair and impartial trial in the county of the city’s location or that a change of venue from such county is required.

Eckman v. Stutsman County, 1999 ND 151, 598 N.W.2d 494, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1999).

   Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a change of venue based on the fact that potential jurors, as residents of Ramsey County, would not be impartial because they were taxpayers subject to a mill levy for the local library. The court reasoned that even though a resident of Ramsey County may have received some indirect benefit from testator’s bequest to the library, this was not sufficient cause to change venue.

         Right to Change of Place of Trial.

       </h5>
       <p>

   A change of place of trial ought to be granted either when there is a reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had in the county from which the change is asked, or when the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change. Lilly v. Haynes Coop. Coal Mining Co., 48 N.D. 937, 188 N.W. 38, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>

   A defendant has an absolute right to an order changing the place of trial to the county of his residence. Clark v. Cleveland, 60 N.D. 460, 235 N.W. 342, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where an action properly triable in the county of defendant’s residence is begun elsewhere, the defendant on proper demand is entitled to a change of the place of trial as a matter of right. Ott v. Kelley, 64 N.D. 361, 252 N.W. 269, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 206</cite> (N.D. 1934).
       </p>
       <p>

   Defendant was entitled to change of venue as matter of right where action, properly triable in county of defendant’s residence, was begun in another county and proper demand for change of place of trial was made.

      In a civil or criminal action in a court affecting the title to real property, the plaintiff, at the time of filing the complaint or criminal information or indictment or at any time afterwards, or the defendant, when the defendant sets up in the defendant’s answer an affirmative claim for relief affecting the title to real property and demands substantive relief, at the time of filing the defendant’s answer or at any time afterwards, may file for record with the recorder of each county in which the real property is situated a notice of the pendency of the action, containing the names of the parties, the object of the action, and a description of the real property affected. From the time of filing only shall the pendency of the action be constructive notice to a purchaser or encumbrancer of the property affected thereby, and every person whose conveyance or encumbrance is subsequently executed or subsequently recorded is deemed a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer with notice and is bound by all proceedings taken after the filing of such notice to the same extent as if that person were a party to the action. For the purpose of this section, an action is deemed to be pending from the time of filing such notice, but the notice in a civil action is of no avail unless it is followed by the first publication of the summons, or by the personal service thereof on a defendant, within sixty days after such filing.

       <p>

   The filing of lis pendens is mere notice of the pendency of an action, constructive as to purchasers or encumbrancers. Beyer v. Investors' Syndicate, 47 N.D. 358, 182 N.W. 934, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>

   Filing lis pendens with the register of deeds without filing a complaint in the district court clerk’s office is not constructive service. Plott v. Kittelson, 58 N.D. 881, 228 N.W. 217, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 292</cite> (N.D. 1929).
       </p>
       <p>

   In the landowners’

   quiet title suit against an oil and gas company to determine conflicting claims and title to an oil and gas lease, summary judgment in favor of the landowners was proper as the company was bound by a settlement in a prior action, and its interest in the lease was subject to the prior lis pendens as per N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-05s28-05-07" target="_self">28-05-07</a></cite>. The company took its assignment of the lease from a prior holder in interest of the lease subject to the outcome of the litigation by the landowners against the prior holder, the prior holder conveyed all of its interest in the lease to a landowner, leaving the prior holder with no interest in the lease and, therefore, the company had no interest in the lease when judgment was entered in the prior action.

   A notice of lis pendens merely serves to give notice to subsequent purchasers or encumbrancers of the pendency of the action, so as to make the judgment therein binding upon such persons. Boehm v. Long, 43 N.D. 1, 172 N.W. 862, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1919).

   The statutory notice of lis pendens does not of itself create a lien or interest in realty.

   McKenzie County v. Casady, 55 N.D. 475, 214 N.W. 461, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action relating to land, where no lis pendens has been filed with the register of deeds as required by a state statute, a finding that a purchaser pending the suit is an innocent purchaser without notice cannot be disturbed without evidence to contradict it.

   The definition of a pending action found in this section is consistent with the use of that term in N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 26(b) and both are applicable to divorce actions, so that once a final determination has been made and the time for appeal has passed, a divorce decree is not “pending” until jurisdiction of the court is reinvoked by motion of a party.

Purcell, 13 N.D. 288, 100 N.W. 726 (1904) and State v. Hopkins, 64 N.D. 301, 252 N.W. 48, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 277</cite> (N.D. 1933).

       <p>

   Where no motion was made that would reinvoke the jurisdiction of the district court, the action was no longer “pending” under this section, and discovery was not appropriate under N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 26(b). Fichter v. Kadrmas, 507 N.W.2d 72, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1993).

       </h5>
       <p>

   The payment of money and the acceptance of the satisfaction extinguished the judgment and the cause of action and resulted in a waiver of the right of appeal. Signor v. Clark, 13 N.D. 35, 99 N.W. 68, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 19</cite> (N.D. 1904).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   If the six-months’ period has elapsed within which time an appeal may be had, without any appeal, the judgment has become final and the action is deemed no longer pending. Weigel v. Powers Elevator Co., 50 N.D. 776, 198 N.W. 121, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 1924).

      Either party to an action may challenge the array of jurors for any legal cause, which must be done by motion setting forth particularly the causes of challenge, and the party opposing the challenge may join issues of law or fact on such motion, and the issues so formed must be tried and decided by the court.

   In an action against a grain terminal association, inclusion on the jury of four women whose husbands were members of the association was an insufficient conflict of interest to challenge the make-up of the jury, especially since it would be difficult to find a family in North Dakota who had never done business with such an association, and since the scope of operations would indicate little direct relationship between an individual lawsuit and a benefit or detriment to an individual member.

   Mere membership in a cooperative does not signify an interest sufficient to automatically disqualify a person from serving as a juror in a case involving the cooperative; to disqualify a prospective juror, a challenger must establish an actual bias, rather than a presumed bias, on the part of the prospective juror.

   This section does not require an employee of one of the parties to be automatically disqualified as a matter of law, particularly in the absence of a challenge for cause to that particular prospective juror; party’s failure to challenge for cause those jurors who were employees of his party opponent constituted a waiver of his right to so challenge.

   Instead of a blanket disqualification of an entire group of potential jurors based on the mere existence of a relationship, subsection (5) requires an analysis of the extent of any individual interest in the outcome of the lawsuit that may exist because of the relationship.

   A county is a “municipal corporation” within a statute respecting the challenging of jurors on the ground of interest. Sheridan County v. Davis, 61 N.D. 744, 240 N.W. 867, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1932).

       <p>

   A statute respecting the right to challenge a juror for cause on the ground of interest excepts a juror whose interest extends no further than that of an ordinary taxpayer. Sheridan County v. Davis, 61 N.D. 744, 240 N.W. 867, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where juror’s interest in the outcome of an action extends no further than to affect him as an ordinary taxpayer, such juror is a competent juror not subject to challenge for cause; nevertheless, whether or not juror’s interest as a taxpayer will impair his ability to act fairly and impartially is a proper subject of inquiry on voir dire.

   Where instructions were given to jury before attorneys were permitted to argue case to jury, party who made no objection to change in order of trial cannot later predicate error upon it. Bormann v. Beckman, 73 N.D. 720, 19 N.W.2d 455, 1945 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1945).

   Where only issue for jury to determine was defendant’s amount of damages in action to condemn right of way over defendant’s land, he had right to open and close argument. Otter Tail Power Co. v. Von Bank, 72 N.D. 497, 8 N.W.2d 599, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1942).

   A plaintiff in an action has the right to open and close unless the judge for special reasons directs otherwise. Myra Found. v. Harvey, 100 N.W.2d 435, 1959 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 1959).

   Where defendants carried the ultimate burden of persuasion under the applicable law on the only disputed issues presented to the jury, trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing defendants to open and close final argument.

      When in the opinion of the court it is proper for the jurors to have a view of the property which is the subject of litigation, or of the place in which any material fact occurred, it may order them to be conducted in a body under the charge of an officer to the place, which must be shown to them by some person appointed by the court for that purpose. While the jurors are thus absent, no person, other than the person so appointed, may speak to them on any subject connected with the trial.

   This section is permissive and not mandatory and denial by trial court of a motion to permit jury to have a view of the property, the subject of litigation in a negligence action, is not error except in the case of an abuse of discretion. Schmitt v. Northern Improvement Co., 115 N.W.2d 713, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1962).

   Trial court’s refusal to permit jury to view the property was not an abuse of its discretion in a negligence action where the evidence did not establish the fact that there had been no material changes in the property damaged, the amount of damages was uncontroverted on the trial and over two years had elapsed since the damage occurred.

       Conduct of jurors in retirement.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the case finally is submitted to the jurors, they may decide in court or retire for deliberation. If they retire, they must be kept together in some convenient place under charge of an officer, until they agree upon a verdict, are temporarily dismissed by the court, or are permanently discharged by the court. Unless, by order of the court, the officer having the jurors under the officer’s charge must not suffer any communication to be made to them, or make any personally except to ask them if they have agreed upon a verdict, and the officer, before the verdict is rendered, must not communicate to anyone the state of their deliberations or the verdict agreed upon. If the jurors have not agreed upon a verdict during normal working hours of any day of deliberations, the trial judge may temporarily dismiss the jurors and direct them when to resume deliberations. If a trial jury contains both male and female members, the trial judge may direct that the female members of the jury be placed in charge of a female bailiff and permitted to retire to a suitable place for rest, and the male members of the jury placed in charge of a male bailiff for a similar purpose. Whenever the jurors are dismissed or separated, as above stated, the trial judge shall admonish the members thereof that they must not in any manner discuss the case with anyone, nor permit anyone to discuss it with them, while they are so dismissed or separated, and that they must discuss and consider the case only in the room when all members of the jury are present.

       <p>

   By failing to bring the jury into court and notify the parties and counsel when the jury had a question about a special verdict form, a trial court exacerbated an error in the form and contributed to the jury ultimately returning an inconsistent and irreconcilable verdict; the question and answer were not merely administrative in nature, and the prevailing parties failed to meet their burden of showing the error was harmless Haley v. Dennis, 2004 ND 96, 679 N.W.2d 263, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 2004).

   Trial court’s failure to honor request by jury to have witnesses’ testimony read to them did not constitute error since, under this section, trial court has discretionary power to determine whether testimony should be read to jury.

     <p>
      If after the impaneling of a jury and before a verdict, a juror becomes sick so as to be unable to perform the juror’s duty, the court may order the juror to be discharged. In that case the trial may proceed by agreement of the parties with the remaining jurors, or an alternate juror may be called, or another juror may be sworn and the trial begun anew, or the jurors may be discharged and a new jury then or afterwards impaneled.

     <p>
      While the jury is absent, the court may adjourn from time to time in respect to other business, but it nevertheless is open for every purpose connected with the cause submitted to the jury, until a verdict is rendered or the jurors are discharged. The court may direct the jurors to bring in a sealed verdict at the opening of the court in case of an agreement during a recess or adjournment for the day. A final adjournment of the court for the term discharges the jurors.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the jurors have agreed upon a verdict, the members thereof must be conducted into court, their names called by the clerk, and the verdict rendered by the foreman. The verdict must be in writing signed by the foreman and must be read by the clerk to the jurors and inquiry made whether it is their verdict. If any juror disagrees, all jurors must be sent out again, but if no disagreement is expressed and neither party requires the jurors to be polled, the verdict is complete and the jury must be discharged from the case. Either party may require the jurors to be polled, which is done by the court or clerk asking each juror if it is that juror’s verdict. If any one answers in the negative, the jurors again must be sent out.

   Where a jury has retired to the jury room for deliberation and, upon returning to the courtroom to render its verdict and upon being polled, one of the jurors disagrees with the verdict, it is reversible error for the trial court to fail or refuse to send the jurors out for further deliberation.

         Aggregate Value Judgment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   In action of claim and delivery where property consists of separate chattels not dependent upon one another for value, judgment rendered for aggregate value is valid in absence of request for specific valuation by defendant. Steidl v. Aitken, 30 N.D. 281, 152 N.W. 276, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1915).

         Combined Remedies.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Plaintiff was permitted to combine remedies under this section, specifically to obtain a money judgment for the balance due on the debt and foreclose on the lien. There was no danger of double recovery because the amended judgment stated that only so much of the property would be sold as necessary to satisfy the judgment. Production Credit Ass'n v. Obrigewitch, 443 N.W.2d 923, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       </h5>
       <p>

   An action to recover damages for conversion is entirely different from an action to recover possession of property. More v. Western Grain Co., 31 N.D. 369, 153 N.W. 976, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 1915).

        </b>
       </h5>

   The awarding of damages for the taking and detention of personal property in claim and delivery does not impair the party’s right to recover the property or its value. Nichols &amp; Shepard Co. v. Paulson, 10 N.D. 440, 87 N.W. 977, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1901).

         Judgment in Alternative.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   A judgment in an action of claim and delivery, in favor of the defendant, should be in the alternative if it is shown that the plaintiff purchased the greater part of the goods at an auction sale held by him before the trial. Smith v. Willoughby, 24 N.D. 1, 138 N.W. 7, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 4</cite> (N.D. 1912).

         Sureties’ Obligation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   An obligation of sureties in claim and delivery for the payment of such sum as for any cause may be recovered against the defendant is not absolute but conditional. Larson v. Hanson, 21 N.D. 411, 131 N.W. 229, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>

   Surety on redelivery bond was not liable in the absence of strict allegation and proof of facts showing it would have been impossible to have returned property to plaintiff if its return had been adjudged. Farmers Nat'l Bank v. Ferguson, 28 N.D. 347, 148 N.W. 1049, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 1914).

      Every judgment that contains a direction for the sale of specific real property also may direct the delivery of the possession of the property to the purchaser, and the officer receiving the execution or order of sale may enforce the judgment by putting the purchaser in possession of the premises as if special execution had been directed to the purchaser for that purpose. The judgment creditor must show that the debtor has an interest in the real property that is the subject of the judgment.

The entry of any judgment affecting the title or possession of real property, except judgments required to be docketed under the provisions of section 28-20-13, is not notice of its contents or constructive notice of such judgment to a subsequent bona fide purchaser or encumbrancer, nor to a privy of any party to such judgment who is otherwise a subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer in good faith, and for a valuable consideration, until a certified copy of such judgment is recorded in the office of the recorder in the county in which such property is located.

   A judgment is neither effective nor final until it is entered in the judgment book. Monson v. Nelson, 145 N.W.2d 892, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1966).

   The process of taxing costs includes notice to the defeated party, thus clerks of court are presumed not to have entered judgment until costs are taxed, in the absence of a showing to the contrary. Bode v. New Eng. Inv. Co., 1 N.D. 121, 45 N.W. 197, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 1890).

   Court order sustaining demurrer and dismissing complaint, with costs to be taxed unless plaintiff amended his complaint, was not a final judgment, but was an order that judgment could be entered in the future upon a specified contingency. Bode v. New Eng. Inv. Co., 1 N.D. 121, 45 N.W. 197, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 1890).

   Final determinations of district courts never assume the authoritative form of a final judgment until the previous adjudication is recorded in the judgment book. In re Weber, 4 N.D. 119, 59 N.W. 523, 28 L.R.A. 621 (1894), distinguished, Oliver v. Wilson, 8 N.D. 590, 80 N.W. 757 (1899) and In re Lemery's Estate, 15 N.D. 312, 107 N.W. 365, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1906).

   Order of dismissal filed and recorded in order book by clerk, or written in minutes of court by judge, did not constitute a final judgment.

   A judgment cannot be proved, over proper objection, by evidence of the judgment docket or of executions issued unless there is a foundation showing the right to submit secondary evidence. Amundson v. Wilson, 11 N.D. 193, 91 N.W. 37, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1902).

   Because defendant appealed from a default judgment without seeking relief under N.D. R. Civ.

   A final judgment does not become such and has no force nor effect until entered by the clerk in the judgment book. In re Weber, 4 N.D. 119, 59 N.W. 523, 28 L.R.A. 621 (1894), distinguished, Oliver v.

       </p>
       <p>

   Order entered irregularly in the judgment book, and embodying the final judicial determination of the action by the court, was sufficient in substance as a judgment. Cameron v. Great N. Ry., 8 N.D. 124, 77 N.W. 1016, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 49</cite> (N.D. 1898).

       On filing a judgment roll upon a judgment that directs the payment of money, the clerk of the district court in which the judgment was rendered shall docket the judgment in a separate record to be known as the “judgment docket”. The judgment may be docketed in any other county upon filing with the clerk of the district court of that county a transcript of the original judgment docket.

      <li id="t28c28-20s28-20-13ol12">
       For a judgment docketed before August 1, 2021, the judgment is a lien on all the real property, except the homestead, of every person against whom the judgment is rendered, which the person may have in any county in which the judgment is docketed at the time of docketing or which the person thereafter acquires in the county, for ten years from the time of docketing the judgment in the county in which it was rendered.

       When a judgment is docketed in a county to which unorganized territory is attached for judicial purposes, the judgment is a lien upon any real property of the judgment debtor situated in the unorganized territory to the same extent as though the real property were situated in the organized county. If the unorganized territory thereafter is organized as a county, a transcript of the judgment docket must be filed in the office of the clerk of the district court of the county within ninety days after the organization of the county, or it ceases to be a lien upon any real property in the county.

      No judgment for the recovery of money against any person may be docketed or entered until the judgment creditor, or the judgment creditor’s agent or attorney, has filed with the clerk of the district court an affidavit stating the full name, occupation, place of residence, and post-office address of the judgment debtor, to the best of the affiant’s information and belief, and if the debtor has a known street address, or residence number, or both, it must be given. This section does not apply to any case in which judgment is taken against a corporation, limited liability company, copartnership, public official, or party sued in a representative capacity. Failure to file such affidavit, or the filing of a defective or insufficient affidavit, does not invalidate the judgment docketed or entered, but the clerk of the district court entering or docketing a judgment without such affidavit of identification is liable to any person damaged thereby in the sum of five dollars.

     <p>
      For judgments initially docketed before August 1, 2021, the entry and docketing of an affidavit of renewal of a judgment operates to continue the lien of the judgment to the extent of the balance due on said judgment as shown by the affidavit on all real property, except the homestead, of the judgment debtor or debtors in the county where the same is docketed which the judgment debtor or debtors may have at the time of such docketing or may acquire subsequently in such county, for a period of ten years from the time of the docketing of such affidavit. The filing of a certified copy of such affidavit of renewal and the docket entries thereon in a county wherein a transcript of the original judgment was docketed likewise continues and extends the lien of said judgment in such county. An execution may issue upon said judgment as renewed under the same conditions and with the same force and effect within such renewal period as upon a judgment originally rendered and entered at the date of such renewal, and all other remedies for the enforcement of judgments apply to the enforcement of such renewed judgment.

   A clerk of the district court has no authority to satisfy a judgment except in the cases where the statute gives him express authority so to do. Milburn-Stoddard Co. v. Stickney, 14 N.D. 282, 103 N.W. 752, 1905 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1905).

   A statute giving an attorney of record authority to satisfy a judgment does not authorize him to compromise the judgment without the consent of the owner. Business Serv. Collection Bureau v. Yegen, 67 N.D. 51, 269 N.W. 46, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1936).

   As the satisfaction of judgments signed by each of the claimants to certain insurance proceeds were not notarized or otherwise witnessed, acknowledged, or authenticated, they did not meet the requirements of this section and the judgment had not been formally satisfied of record. Nodak Mut. Ins. Co. v. Stegman, 2002 ND 113, 647 N.W.2d 133, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 2002).

   Although property owner paid the judgment in favor of township and procured and filed a satisfaction of judgment, the satisfaction of judgment did not meet the requirements of this section because it was not notarized or otherwise witnessed and authenticated; accordingly, the judgment was not formally satisfied of record and an appeal was not jurisdictionally barred. Mr. G's Turtle Mt. Lodge, Inc. v. Roland Twp., 2002 ND 140, 651 N.W.2d 625, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 2002).

      Any judgment debtor upon a money judgment duly docketed in the district court from which judgment an appeal has been perfected to the supreme court by the judgment creditor may cause such judgment to be released as a lien against the real property of said judgment debtor by depositing with the clerk of the district court in which said judgment was entered originally a sum of money equal to one and one-third times the amount of said judgment with interest and costs, and upon such deposit the clerk shall satisfy and discharge the said judgment as a lien against the real property of said judgment debtor. In lieu of depositing the money as aforesaid, the judgment debtor may file with the clerk of the district court a good and sufficient bond executed as provided by law for the execution of a bail bond conditioned for the payment of such judgment upon its final determination in the appellate court, or at any time upon the dismissal of the appeal. Such bond must be approved by the judge of the district court.

   In property owner’s action against township and township’s attorney where the trial court awarded the attorney a judgment for attorney fees and costs for defending the frivolous action, the property owner did not avail himself of the statutory options to release the lien under this section, but paid the judgment to the attorney and procured and filed a satisfaction of judgment on the record; under these circumstances, the property owner’s payment of the judgment was voluntary and constituted a waiver of the right to appeal.

       Interest rate on judgments.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Interest is payable on judgments entered in the courts of this state at the same rate as is provided in the original instrument upon which the action resulting in the judgment is based, which rate may not exceed the maximum rate provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.47.html#t47c47-14s47-14-09" target="_blank">47-14-09</a></cite>. If such original instrument contains no provision as to an interest rate, or if the action resulting in the judgment was not based upon an instrument, interest is payable at the rate of twelve percent per annum through December 31, 2005. Beginning January 1, 2006, the interest is payable at a rate equal to the prime rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the first Monday in December of each year plus three percentage points rounded up to the next one-half percentage point and may not be compounded in any manner or form. On or before the twentieth day of December each year, the state court administrator shall determine the rate and shall transmit notice of that rate to all clerks of court and to the state bar association of North Dakota. As established, the rate shall be in effect beginning the first day of the following January through the last day of December in each year. Except as otherwise provided in this section, interest on all judgments entered in the courts of this state before January 1, 2006, must remain at the rate per annum which was legally prescribed at the time the judgments were entered, and such interest may not be compounded in any manner or form. Interest on unpaid child support obligations must be calculated under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.14.html#t14c14-09s14-09-25" target="_blank">14-09-25</a></cite> according to the rate currently in effect under this section regardless of the date the obligations first became due and unpaid.

   District court did not err in awarding post-judgment interest because the arbitrator awarded partners damages for their claims under the construction contract, which stated payments due and unpaid under the contract would bear interest from the date payment was due at a rate of one and a half percent monthly; the arbitrator awarded the partners damages based on the construction contract and interest on the contractual damages at the rate the construction contract required. 26th St. Hospitality, LLP v.

   The general rule is that interest on unpaid installments of alimony [spousal support] accrues on the date they become due. This general rule should logically apply to past-due child support payments as well as to past-due spousal support payments. Baranyk v. McDowell, 442 N.W.2d 423, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>

   As no mention is made in the legislative history regarding interest on judgments for unpaid child support obligations, the legislature intended that judgment interest be determined in the same manner as the judgments entered by the district court. The interest on a judgment is calculated at the rate provided in this section. Baranyk v. McDowell, 442 N.W.2d 423, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1989).

   This section does not allow any type of compounding of interest, and where the decree set “interest compounded annually at the rate of 3.5%”, the decree was modified to reflect a simple interest rate of four percent per annum.

   District court judgment which combined father’s child support arrears and accrued interest into a single docketed money judgment created the risk that the interest would be compounded in violation of this section; on remand district court was instructed to amend its order to specify that the defendant as of a certain date owed the plaintiff a principal sum in child support arrears and a certain sum of accrued interest, with interest continuing to accrue only upon each of the unpaid installments.

   District court did not err in denying appellant ex-wife’s motion to find appellee ex-husband in contempt for failing to comply with a 1993 divorce judgment that awarded her personal property because a contempt of court motion could not be maintained based upon a divorce judgment that expired 10 years after entry without being renewed. Because the judgment had not been renewed, it was canceled by operation of law under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-20s28-20-35" target="_self">28-20-35</a></cite>, and for a contempt finding under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.14.html#t14c14-05s14-05-25.1" target="_blank">14-05-25.1</a></cite>, a violation of a valid and existing court order, judgment, or decree had to exist.

   Judgment was not cancelled where the original judgment was entered on August 1, 1983, the remaining balance was renewed within the ten year period on July 9, 1993, and it had not been twenty years since entry.

       <p>

   A valid, legally enforceable debt is an essential element of an action to set aside a fraudulent transfer. Because the judgment against original debtor was no longer enforceable, it could not set aside the transfer of $9500 to his son; there was no allegation that judgment debtor was absent from the state to toll the statute of limitations, nor was this a separate action upon the original judgment.

   District court did not err in concluding that the creditor’s attempt to collect on a 1989 North Carolina judgment against the debtor was no longer enforceable where the North Carolina judgment expired on January 10, 2010, and there was no statute that allowed for tolling of the limitation period in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-20s28-20-35" target="_self">28-20-35</a></cite>.

A party seeking to renew its judgment had to substantially comply with the statutory procedure.

   Plaintiff failed to file its renewal affidavit within 90 days preceding the expiration of 10 years from the first docketing of its 1998 judgment against defendant, and plaintiff’s 1998 judgment had been cancelled of record for almost two years before plaintiff sought to renew it.

     <p>
      A partial payment made on a judgment must be applied first to postjudgment costs. If the payment exceeds the costs, the excess amount must be applied toward satisfying the interest due. If the payment exceeds the costs and interest, the excess amount must be applied toward discharging the judgment amount, and the subsequent interest is to be computed on the balance of the judgment amount remaining due. If the payment falls short of satisfying the costs and interest, interest continues to accrue on the former judgment amount until a payment is made that exceeds the sum of the costs and interest due at the time of payment, and then the excess amount must be applied toward discharging the judgment amount, and interest accrues thereafter on the balance of the judgment amount remaining due. This section does not apply to the collection of any debt owed to the state or a political subdivision.

   Judgments of foreign countries are not included in the definition of foreign judgment for purposes of this chapter; language “any judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States or of any other court which is entitled to full faith and credit in this state” refers to Article VI, section 1 of the United States Constitution, which provides that full faith and credit shall be given to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state.

   Medical Arts Bldg. v. Eralp, 290 N.W.2d 241, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court properly vacated a Missouri foreign judgment as void because it was not entitled to full faith and credit since an employee failed to explain how jurisdiction was acquired for the entry of a judgment based on a settlement agreement to which the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) was not a party; WSI was not a party to the Missouri administrative proceedings and was not a party to the settlement agreement.

   Construing subsection (3) in a practical manner, giving consideration to the context of the statute and the purpose for which it was enacted, a judgment creditor may not execute on or commence other processes for enforcement of a foreign judgment until the notice procedures provided in subsection (2) have been satisfied. Brossart v. Janke, 2020 ND 98, 942 N.W.2d 856, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>

   Because the notice requirements provided in subsection (2) are in conflict with the procedures in N.D. R. Civ. P. 5, and under N.D. R. Civ. P. 81, the requirements provided in statute prevail. Brossart v. Janke, 2020 ND 98, 942 N.W.2d 856, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>

   Because judgment debtors were informed of the proceedings against them and had an opportunity to respond prior to the court issuing its order, they suffered no prejudice from the failure to promptly comply with subsection (2); therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering the debtors to answer interrogatories. Brossart v. Janke, 2020 ND 98, 942 N.W.2d 856, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>

   District court erred, as a matter of law, in its conclusion that judgment debtors were provided notice under subsection (2) through the notice of filing of the federal judgment served on the attorney who represented them in the federal lawsuit because subsection (2) required the clerk of court or the defendants to mail notice of the filing of the federal judgment to the creditors, not their attorney. Brossart v. Janke, 2020 ND 98, 942 N.W.2d 856, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Whether or not enforcement proceedings were stayed from the time the judgment debtor acquired knowledge of the filing of a foreign judgment without having been mailed notice was immaterial because, under the facts of the case, the result was the same; whether enforcement proceedings were stayed for a period of ten days a certain date was immaterial because the district court did not issue its order until more than ten days after the judgment creditors were provided notice. Brossart v. Janke, 2020 ND 98, 942 N.W.2d 856, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 2020).

      A judgment creditor or the party’s duly appointed personal representatives at any time within ten years after the entry of judgment may proceed to enforce the judgment by execution as provided in this chapter. If the judgment creditor in a mortgage foreclosure does not proceed within sixty days after entry of judgment in the foreclosure to serve a special execution and proceed without delay to a sheriff’s sale, any other lienholder or other interested person may obtain the special execution and proceed to arrange for a sheriff’s sale.

   If the execution of a judgment of ejectment against a railroad corporation will operate harshly, and will seriously affect public interests, a court of equity in its discretion may suspend its execution for a period sufficient to enable it to prosecute condemnation proceedings.

   Partial summary judgment which did not adjudicate the defendants’ counterclaims and which did not contain a N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 54(b) statement was not a final judgment and, therefore, it was improper to execute on it.

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-21s28-21-01" target="_self">28-21-01</a></cite> does not limit a sale to 60 days after receipt of a writ of execution by a sheriff; instead, the statute specifically provides that under some circumstances the execution is returnable to the clerk within a reasonable time following the sale, or within ninety days after receipt. Moreover, if a levy has been made and a party raises an issue about ownership of the property or exemptions, a court may extend the execution for a reasonable time.

     <p>
      If a judgment creditor proposes to execute on moneys owed to the judgment debtor by a third party who is retaining the money pursuant to garnishment, the execution must be made between twenty and three hundred sixty days after service of the garnishment summons. The execution may be served by personal service or by certified mail upon the third party by a sheriff or by an attorney licensed to practice law in this state. The execution may be directed to the sheriff of any county. A transcript of the judgment need not be filed in the county of the sheriff to whom the execution is directed. Upon receipt, the third party shall remit the amount due under the garnishment to the sheriff or the attorney who shall proceed in all other respects like the sheriff making a similar execution. If the judgment debtor files a claim of exemptions under section 32-09.1-22 within twenty days after service of the garnishment summons, an execution may not be made against moneys claimed as exempt and retained under the garnishment summons until the court determines that the moneys being garnished are not exempt.

   A voidable sale is one where the sheriff has authority to make the sale but exercises that authority in a manner that allows an interested party to challenge the sale, as when the sheriff fails to follow a manner-of-sale statute.

      An execution must be issued in the name of the state of North Dakota, attested in the name of the judge of the court that entered the judgment, sealed with the seal of the court, subscribed by the clerk of that court, and directed and delivered to a sheriff. The execution must describe the judgment, stating the date and time the judgment was filed with the clerk, the courts and counties to which the judgment has been transcribed, the names of the parties, and the last-known address of the judgment debtor. A special execution must state the amount of money due to the judgment creditor, the date and time the judgment was docketed by the clerk, the rate of interest applicable to the judgment, the amount of the costs accrued on the judgment as of the date of issuance of the execution, and if the execution is being issued to a sheriff of a different county, the date and time the judgment was docketed in that county. If the execution is for the delivery of the possession of property, the execution must also particularly describe the property to be delivered, identify the party entitled to possession of the property, and if the same judgment orders the judgment debtor to pay any costs, damages, or rents or profits to the party entitled to possession of the property, list the amounts due as of the date of issuance of the execution. Upon receipt of an execution, the sheriff shall:

      The execution must be returned to the clerk within sixty days after the receipt by the officer. If a sheriff’s levy has been made within the sixty days, the execution must be returned within a reasonable time following the completion of the sale of the property or ninety days after receipt by the officer. If a levy has been made and the issue of ownership of the property or interest in the property is raised by any party, or if the issue whether the property is exempt under chapter 28-22 is raised by either party, the court having jurisdiction may extend, for good cause shown, the execution for a reasonable time to accommodate due notice and hearing to determine these issues and to provide time for the publication of notice of sale and sale of the property subject to execution.

   In order to constitute a levy there must be an assertion of dominion, or some overt act amounting to an assertion of dominion over the property in question. Although a physical seizure is not, under certain circumstances, required under this section, there nevertheless must be some overt act which manifests an intent to assume dominion over the property.

   District court abused its discretion in holding a father in contempt because a mother did not allege that any of the provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 28-21 governing execution and levy were violated, and the circumstances did not amount to an intentional disobedience of a court order under

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.27.html#t27c27-10s27-10-01.1" target="_blank">27-10-01.1</a></cite>(1)(c); a district court order merely denied the father’s request for an equitable offset of the parties’

   mutual obligations and did not declare that the father was prohibited from using any other available remedies to enforce the mother’s child support obligation.

   Where sheriff did not post a deputy on judgment debtor’s premises to assume control over the property nor did he indicate to anyone present at judgment debtor’s that judgment debtor’s personal property was constructively or otherwise taken under his control, and where the sheriff merely entered judgment debtor’s premises intending to levy on judgment debtor’s personal property by serving president of judgment debtor with a previously prepared notice of levy, and where not finding president present, the sheriff simply left, intending to serve president later that afternoon, the acts of the sheriff in this case prior to serving the notice of levy were insufficient to effectuate a levy; his later service of the notice of levy could not relate back to the time he first appeared at judgment debtor’s premises, inquired of president’s whereabouts and left without further exercising control of the property.

   In levying an execution upon personal property, the sheriff must notify the debtor that any claim of exemptions is to be made within ten days after service of the notice. Mees v. Ereth, 466 N.W.2d 135, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1991).

      If more than one execution against a judgment debtor is outstanding when a levy upon property of a judgment debtor is made, the property must be applied to the execution first received by the sheriff. The balance, if any, of the property must be applied to subsequent executions in order of time as received by the sheriff. However, property of the judgment debtor which was not previously levied upon but which is subject to levy and which is particularly described either in the execution or in a written notice to the sheriff by the judgment creditor or the creditor’s agent or attorney must be applied to that execution regardless of time of receipt of the execution by the sheriff.

      If a judgment is rendered upon any instrument in writing in which two or more persons are severally bound, and it appears to the court that a person signed the same as surety or bail for that person’s codefendant, the court shall state which of the defendants is principal debtor and which is surety or bail. Execution issued on the judgment must command the sheriff to cause the property of the principal debtor to be sold and if the proceeds from that sale are insufficient, to collect the deficiency from the property of the surety or bail. The property of the principal debtor within the jurisdiction of the court must be exhausted before any of the property of the surety or bail may be taken in execution.

   Debtor was entitled to an exemption for his undivided one-half interest in jointly held homestead property because his interest became the property of the estate when he filed the bankruptcy petition, and the nondebtor spouse retained the remaining one-half interest in the property outside of the bankruptcy estate; to allow the trustee access to the entire value of the real estate before the exemption would bring the nondebtor spouse’s property into the estate and diminish her interest.

        “Head of a Family”.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankruptcy debtor who shared a house with his elderly mother was not a “head of family;” although the debtor helped his mother with grocery shopping, transportation and the filling of her insulin syringes, the mother was not physically, mentally or financially disabled and the assistance he gave her did not rise to the level of care and maintenance required for the head of a family exemption. In re Hankel, 223 B.R. 728, 1998 Bankr. LEXIS 991 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor was not entitled to claim a personal property exemption as a head of household in his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy proceeding; even though the debtor claimed that his sister was dependent upon him, there was evidence that the sister was able to hold a job and to pay the debtor rent and board.

   District court abused its discretion in holding a father in contempt because a mother did not allege that any of the provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 28-21 governing execution and levy were violated, and the circumstances did not amount to an intentional disobedience of a court order under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.27.html#t27c27-10s27-10-01.1" target="_blank">27-10-01.1</a></cite>(1)(c); a district court order merely denied the father’s request for an equitable offset of the parties’

        Debtors did not abandon their home that was located in Bismarck, North Dakota (Bismarck home) simply by relocating to Medora, North Dakota, where the relocation was temporary and necessary for the debtors to manage their business which was located in that city, and in addition, it was reasonable for the debtors to have purchased a mobile home in Medora because they were away for an extended period of time while tending to their business and needed a temporary or second dwelling. Accordingly, the debtors could claim as exempt under N.D.C.C. § 47-18-16 the proceeds from the sale of the Bismarck home.

        Bankruptcy exemptions are fixed at the date of filing. Therefore, where, at the time of filing for bankruptcy, debtor had one dependent child and properly claimed a homestead exemption, that exemption did not revert to the bankruptcy estate upon debtor’s death during pendency of the proceedings, despite the fact that debtor’s child was no longer a dependent.

   Debtor was entitled to an exemption for his undivided one-half interest in jointly held homestead property because his interest became the property of the estate when he filed the bankruptcy petition, and the nondebtor spouse retained the remaining one-half interest in the property outside of the bankruptcy estate; to allow the trustee access to the entire value of the real estate before the exemption would bring the nondebtor spouse’s property into the estate and diminish her interest.

        Chapter 7 trustee met his burden under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(c) of showing that a debtor’s amendment under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1009(a) claiming an increased homestead exemption under N.D.C.C. § 28-22-03 was made in bad faith where some of the same facts that resulted in a denial of his discharge under 11 U.S.C.S. § 727(a)(2) and (4), fraudulently concealing the value of his house and making a false oath as to it, were evidence of bad faith. The court rejected the debtor’s argument that there could be no finding of bad faith because he disclosed the existence of his homestead while concealing the true value of the house, and the court also held that the debtor could be denied the opportunity to amend his schedules even though he realized no profit from the concealment or undervaluation.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The North Dakota Legislature intended to fashion this section in the tracks of section 522(d)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, and courts have held that the section 522(d)(1) exemptions relate to any property of the debtor. In re Ptacek, 78 B.R. 986, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 1690 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   The legislature intended the monetary limitation phrase to apply to all the personal property listed in this section; the limitation phrase groups the property into four categories, “pensions, policies, plans, and accounts,” and limits each item to $100,000 with an aggregate limitation of $200,000 for all exempted items.

        Where a Chapter 7 trustee objected to debtors’
        claim that their insurance policies were exempt under North Dakota law after the debtors filed amended schedules, the trustee’s objection was timely because the debtors’
        amendment substantively revised their life insurance policy exemption and materially changed it, the debtors reopened the deadline to object to this exemption claim by filing the amendment, and the trustee’s objection was filed within 30 days after the amendment was filed; the debtors could not claim the exemption in more than $8,000 in cash value per debtor for the policies.

       How exemptions claimed — Appraisal.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All property claimed as exempt must be selected by the debtor or the debtor’s agent or attorney regardless of whether levy has been made yet on the property by the sheriff or levying officer. Failure to claim all exempt property at the time exemptions are claimed renders the unclaimed property nonexempt for purposes of this chapter. The value thereof, when material, must be determined by an appraisement made under the direction of the sheriff or other officer. Whenever any debtor, against whom an execution, writ of attachment, or other process has been issued, desires to claim the benefit of section 28-22-03, such debtor or the debtor’s agent or attorney, shall make a schedule of all of the debtor’s personal property of every kind and character, including money on hand and debts due and owing to the debtor, and shall deliver the same to the officer having the execution, writ of attachment, or other process. The schedule must be subscribed and sworn to by the debtor or the debtor’s agent or attorney, and any property owned by the debtor and not included in such schedule is not exempt. No claim for exemptions may be disallowed for insufficiency as to form unless three days’ notice in writing has been given first of the insufficiency by the party in interest claiming such insufficiency to the person making the claim for exemptions, and specifying in apt language the defect complained of. The person claiming the exemption thereupon may amend the same to conform to the objections made within three days, if that person desires so to do, by serving upon the proper person an amended claim for exemptions.

       <p>

   Debtor’s selection of exemptions must be so specific and certain that the officer will be apprised of the exact claim made, but it is sufficient if made to levying officer in a way in which he cannot misunderstand it. Northrup v. Cross, 2 N.D. 433, 51 N.W. 718, 1892 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 1892).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Failure to include all of debtor’s property in schedule, if not done with intent to defraud, does not deprive him of his exemptions, but only of his right to select those items omitted from the schedule. Wagner v. Olson, 3 N.D. 69, 54 N.W. 286, 1893 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 1</cite> (N.D. 1893).
       </p>
       <p>

   Failure of debtor to state in affidavit that schedule he had filed listed all of his personal property defeated his claim to exemptions. Pfeifer v. Hatton, 18 N.D. 144, 118 N.W. 19, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1908).
       </p>
       <p>

   The failure of a debtor to include in a schedule of his personal property all of such property, if done without fraudulent intent and without misleading the officer as to the amount of the debtor’s property, will not deprive the debtor of his exemptions. Burcell v. Goldstein, 23 N.D. 257, 136 N.W. 243, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1912).

   A debtor has absolute right to select as a part of his exemptions a judgment that he owns and once selected such judgment is not subject to statute providing that mutual judgments can be set off.

   Levy of attachment or execution in action to recover purchase price was rendered null and void by federal statute which discharged all liens attaching less than four months before filing of petition in bankruptcy.

        Where North Dakota laws controlled debtors' exemption rights, because debtors did not reside in North Dakota at time they filed their bankruptcy petition, debtors were limited to the “absolute” exemptions. In re Rodenbough, 579 B.R. 545, 2018 Bankr. LEXIS 50 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2018).

       <p>

   Absolute exemptions only are allowed against an execution on a judgment on property obtained under false pretenses. Taylor v. Rice, 1 N.D. 72, 44 N.W. 1017, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 9</cite> (N.D. 1890); In re Koeppler, 7 N.D. 435, 75 N.W. 789, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1898).
       </p>
       <p>

   Debts incurred by party under false pretenses were not subject to property exemption law and sheriff was justified in seizing property under writs of attachment. Taylor v. Rice, 1 N.D. 72, 44 N.W. 1017, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 9</cite> (N.D. 1890).
       </p>
       <p>

   Judgment debtor’s property could not be seized in a levy based on theory that it had been obtained by false pretenses, where judgment on which execution was issued was for suit on the note, and issue of false pretenses had not been litigated. Sobolisk v. Jacobson, 6 N.D. 175, 69 N.W. 46, 1896 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite> (N.D. 1896).

        North Dakota had opted out of the federal exemption scheme completely and a Chapter 7 debtor residing in North Dakota when the petition was filed was limited to exemptions allowed under North Dakota law.
        In re Domitrovich, 2008 Bankr. LEXIS 99 (Bankr. D.N.D. Jan. 10, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>

   11 U.S.C.S. § 522(b)(2) authorizes states to opt out of the federal scheme of property exemptions enumerated in 11 U.S.C.S. § 522(d), and North Dakota has enacted its own set of property exemptions for purposes of bankruptcy and limits its residents to claiming the state exemptions rather than the federal exemptions, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-22s28-22-17" target="_self">28-22-17</a></cite>. Exemption statutes are construed liberally in favor of a debtor, and a party who objects to a debtor’s claim has the burden of showing that an exemption is not properly claimed, pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003(c).

       <p>
        Where a Chapter 7 trustee objected to debtors’
        claim that their insurance policies were exempt under North Dakota law after the debtors filed amended schedules, the trustee’s objection was timely because the debtors’
        amendment substantively revised their life insurance policy exemption and materially changed it, the debtors reopened the deadline to object to this exemption claim by filing the amendment, and the trustee’s objection was filed within 30 days after the amendment was filed; the debtors could not claim the exemption in more than $8,000 in cash value per debtor for the policies.

      If the levy is upon harvested crops, at the option of the judgment creditor, the crops may be sold in the nearest usual market for crops, at any time after such levy at the market price without publishing notice of sale. In that case, the notice of levy or a subsequent notice to be served as the notice of levy is served must state where and when the crops will be sold. Should the judgment debtor, or the judgment debtor’s agent or attorney, at the time the levy is made, give notice to the officer making the levy that the judgment debtor intends to settle the judgment, the officer shall hold the grain six days before making sale of the grain. The usual and reasonable charges for the sale and transportation of the grain to market must be deemed proper expenses chargeable as costs in the proceedings, and in case the notice above provided for is served on the officer there also must be chargeable reasonable charges for storing the grain.

   Because mortgage company did not provide separate mailed notice to debtor or her counsel regarding the time and place of the sheriff’s sale even though she was actively involved in the foreclosure process, and because mortgage company did not serve her with a copy of the proposed order confirming the sheriff’s sale, the order confirming the sale was vacated.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All sales of property under execution must be made at public auction to the highest bidder, between the hours of nine a.m. and four p.m. After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no more property may be sold. A sheriff or other officer or the sheriff’s or officer’s deputy holding the execution or making the sale of property may not become a purchaser or be interested directly or indirectly in any purchase at the sale. A purchase so made must be considered fraudulent and void. If the sale is of personal property capable of manual delivery, it must be within view of those who attend the sale and must be sold in parcels as are likely to bring the highest price, and when the sale is of real property consisting of several known lots or parcels they must be sold separately unless they constitute one parcel on which improvements have been constructed. The judgment debtor, if present at the sale, may direct the order in which property must be sold if the property consists of several known lots or parcels or of articles which can be sold to advantage separately. The sheriff or other officer shall follow these directions.

   The purpose of manner-of-sale laws is to give the debtor an opportunity to redeem from any or all parcels or lots, to sell only so much of the property as is necessary to pay the debt, and to get the highest possible price for the land sold. These laws are also intended to assist a debtor in protecting homestead rights.

   Despite statutory provisions providing for the sale of real property as known lots or parcels, mortgagors may at the time of executing the mortgage waive the statutory right to have real property sold in separate lots or parcels. Production Credit Ass'n v. Henderson, 429 N.W.2d 421, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1988).

   The debtor may designate the lot or parcel containing his home or dwelling for separate sale and redemption and this right is in addition to the right granted under this section and reinforced in SB No. 2469, allowing the debtor to designate separate “known” lots for separate sale and redemption.

   An action for wrongful execution may be based upon a wrongful sale. The violation of a statutory duty is, at the very least, evidence of a party’s violation of a standard of care. Lang v. Barrios, 472 N.W.2d 464, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1991), dismissed, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 206</cite> (N.D. Nov. 10, 1993).

      When there are no bidders, or when the amount offered is grossly inadequate, or when from any cause the sale of any real or personal property upon execution or upon the foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien is prevented from taking place on the day fixed, the sheriff, or person making the same, may postpone the sale for not more than three days without being required to give any further notice thereof, but the sheriff or person may not make more than two such postponements, and such postponements must be publicly announced when and where the sale should have taken place. Such sale may be postponed for a longer period than three days by continuing the publication of the original notice of sale together with notice of such postponement, specifying the time and place at which such postponed sale will be made.

   Defendant, as judgment debtor, is not as defined by this section, a redemptioner, and therefore is not entitled to relief under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-24s28-24-03" target="_self">28-24-03</a></cite>. Defendant’s remedy was to redeem the real estate within the one year period of redemption as provided in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-24s28-24-02" target="_self">28-24-02</a></cite>.

   The classes of persons who may redeem property sold subject to redemption include creditors having a lien by judgment or mortgage on the property sold subsequent to that on which the property was sold.

   MC DONALD v. BEATTY, 10 N.D. 511, 88 N.W. 281, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 1901).
       </p>
       <p>

   A bank which was pledgee of a mortgage junior to the rights of a creditor having a lien and who had redeemed from foreclosure of mortgage, was a creditor and proper redemptioner from the previous redemptioner under this section. Mehlhoff v. Pioneer State Bank, 124 N.W.2d 401, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite>, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>

   A creditor holding a subordinate lien upon property which has been foreclosed upon does not have to redeem, and the creditor may make an outright purchase of the sheriff’s certificate. Lang v. Bank of Steele, 415 N.W.2d 787, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 430</cite> (N.D. 1987).

   Where property sold on execution sale was subject to redemption, creditor, who had lien subsequent to that on which execution was obtained, had right of redemption; upon expiration of period of redemption and issuance of sheriff’s deed to execution purchaser, full beneficial ownership of judgment debtor in property sold, including legal title, passed to purchaser at execution sale and redemption rights were lost.

   In order to redeem after creditor’s purchase of a sheriff’s certificate, the debtor need pay only the purchase price with interest, plus amounts which have been paid to protect the premises. That part of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-24s28-24-02" target="_self">28-24-02</a></cite> which requires a “redemptioner” to pay superior liens held by the purchaser excludes debtors, only including creditors having liens on the property; thus, a debtor is not a redemptioner and does not have to pay the superior lien. Lang v. Bank of Steele, 415 N.W.2d 787, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 430</cite> (N.D. 1987).

         Right of Redemption.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   The right of redemption is limited to a period of one year from the day of sale, and the permissible extension applies only in case of a redemption by redemptioner within one year from the day of sale. State ex rel. Forest Lake State Bank v. Herman, 36 N.D. 177, 161 N.W. 1017, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 1917).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where a redemptioner has been prevented from exercising his right to redeem within the statutory period by the fraud of one, who as a result of the failure to redeem, obtains title to the premises, a sheriff’s deed may be set aside and a redemption permitted after the expiration of the statutory redemption period. Security State Bank v. Kramer, 51 N.D. 20, 198 N.W. 679, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenant that did not have a lien interest in the property at issue did not have a right of redemption under this section because tenant was not a judgment debtor, or the judgment debtor’s successor in interest, or a creditor with a judgment lien, mortgage, or other lien interest.
        United States v. Vilhauer, 57 Fed. Appx. 711, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 3529 (8th Cir. N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>

   Junior redemptioners were properly given a sheriff’s deed to real property despite their failure to comply with the indemnity bond filing requirements of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-24s28-24-08" target="_self">28-24-08</a></cite>, as the senior redemptioner was the purchaser but after the junior redemptioners redeemed the property, the senior redemptioner did not retain his status as a purchaser, but instead became a redemptioner through his assignments from judgment creditors, pursuant to N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-24s28-24-01" target="_self">28-24-01</a></cite>(2) and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-24s28-24-03" target="_self">28-24-03</a></cite>; the indemnity bond requirement did not apply in the case of successive redemptions by redemptioners and accordingly, no bond was required.

   Where first mortgagee foreclosed its mortgage, second mortgagee’s right to foreclose its junior mortgage on the same property was extinguished, and second mortgagee was left with a statutory right of redemption; and when the redemption period expired, second mortgagee lost all rights and interest in the property through its mortgage. National Credit Union Share Ins. Fund v. University Developers, 335 N.W.2d 559, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 337</cite> (N.D. 1983).

   The holder of a superior lien makes a sufficient redemption from a mortgage sale by paying to the redemptioner the amount for which the land was foreclosed, together with interest, cost, and taxes and assessments paid.

     <p>
      The judgment debtor or redemptioner may redeem the property from the purchaser during the redemption period by paying the amount of the bid and any additional lien claimed under section 28-24-07 with interest at the rate provided in the original instrument on which the judgment is based. If the purchaser is also a creditor having a lien superior to that of the redemptioner, the amount of that prior lien with interest must be paid to effect a redemption. Except as provided in section 32-19-18 for redemption from foreclosure sales, the redemption period is one year from the date of the sheriff’s sale.

   The statute does not require one seeking to redeem from a purchaser at a mortgage foreclosure sale to pay to the purchaser, in addition to his purchase price, with interest, the amount of a mortgage lien prior to the one foreclosed. Leverson v. Olson, 25 N.D. 624, 142 N.W. 917, 1913 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1913).

   To redeem from a second mortgagee who purchased at a first mortgage foreclosure sale, a third mortgagee must pay the amount of the second mortgagee’s purchase, with interest, and taxes paid, plus interest thereon, and the amount of the second mortgage lien, with interest.

   The subordinate lienholder’s purchase of the sheriff’s certificate from the superior lienholder a few days prior to the end of the redemption period did not affect the debtor’s right to redeem the property by paying the purchase price, plus interest, and any additional amounts paid to protect the property. Lang v. Bank of Steele, 415 N.W.2d 787, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 430</cite> (N.D. 1987).

   In order to redeem after creditor’s purchase of a sheriff’s certificate, the debtor need pay only the purchase price with interest, plus amounts which have been paid to protect the premises. That part of this section which requires a “redemptioner” to pay superior liens held by the purchaser excludes debtors, only including creditors having liens on the property; thus, a debtor is not a redemptioner and does not have to pay the superior lien.

     <p>
      A redemptioner shall give a written notice of redemption to the sheriff and at the same time shall record a duplicate in the office of the county recorder of the county where the land is situated. The redemptioner must state in the notice of redemption an amount that the redemptioner will credit on the claim on making redemption. If the amount stated in the notice is less than the amount of the lien under which the redemptioner makes redemption, a later redemptioner having a subordinate lien may redeem from the earlier redemptioner by paying the amount paid by that redemptioner, and interest at the same rate as provided in the original instrument on which the judgment is based, together with the amount stated by the first redemptioner in the notice. The amount stated by a redemptioner in the notice must be treated as a payment of that amount on the indebtedness and the redemptioner immediately shall endorse that on the evidence of the claim. If the claim is a judgment, the redemptioner shall cause a statement of that amount to be entered by the clerk of court in the judgment docket. That credit is conditional and must be canceled on proof of a further redemption by the debtor or by a redemptioner having a prior right, without payment of the amount credited.

      If property is redeemed by a redemptioner, another redemptioner, even after the expiration of the redemption period, may redeem from the last redemption if the redemption is made within sixty days after recording of the notice of redemption. This sixty-day limitation does not apply to any redemption made within the redemption period, but all persons entitled to redeem in all cases must have the entire statutory redemption period in which to redeem. The property, as often as a redemptioner is so disposed, may be redeemed again from any previous redemptioner within sixty days after the recording of the last notice of redemption.

     <p>
      The debtor may not be required to pay more to effect a redemption than the purchase price, with interest from the day of sale, at the same rate as provided in the original instrument on which the judgment is based, despite the fact that the debtor seeks to redeem from a redemptioner. If the debtor redeems, the effect of the sale is terminated and the debtor is restored to the estate. On a redemption by the debtor, the person to whom the payment is made shall execute and deliver to the debtor a certificate of redemption acknowledged or proved before an officer authorized to take acknowledgments of conveyances of real property. The certificate must be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the property is situated and the county recorder shall note that record in the margin of the record of the certificate of sale. If the debtor redeems from a redemptioner who, to effect redemption, has paid liens on the property other than for taxes or assessments, the redemptioner is subrogated to all the rights of the former holders of those liens, and the recording of written notice of that redemption is notice of the rights of that redemptioner in and to all the liens the redemptioner holds as equitable assignee as fully as if formal written assignments had been recorded.

      If a sale of real estate is made under execution or upon mortgage foreclosure, the purchaser at the sale or the purchaser’s successor in interest, in case of the expiration during the period of redemption of any insurance policy on the premises sold, may pay the premium necessary to procure a renewal of that policy, and, if any taxes or assessments become delinquent, or if any installment of interest or principal on any prior or superior mortgage becomes due during that period of redemption, and any utilities or other items to be paid by the purchaser in protection of the title or premises, the purchaser may pay those charges. The amount paid, with interest at the same rate as provided in the original instrument on which the judgment is based, is part of the sum necessary to be paid for the redemption from the sale. The payments must be proved by a written notice of additional lien verified by affidavit of the purchaser, the purchaser’s agent or attorney, stating the items and describing the premises. That notice must be recorded in the office of the county recorder and a copy of the notice served on the sheriff of the county. After that service the sheriff shall collect the full amount specified in the notice in addition to the amount which would otherwise be due in redemption from the sale, and shall pay over that amount to the purchaser at the sale, or the purchaser’s assignee. If the notice is not served on the sheriff and recorded within five days after payment, redemption may be made without paying those amounts.

   Trial court did not err in failing to require junior redemptioners who acquired the real property at issue to reimburse a senior redemptioner for taxes, assessment, utilities, and insurance premiums that he paid for maintenance of the property, as there was no compliance with the written notice requirements of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-24s28-24-07" target="_self">28-24-07</a></cite> for purposes of expenses paid as the original purchaser, and as there was no notice pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-24s28-24-10" target="_self">28-24-10</a></cite>, all such expenses and other costs could be avoided upon redemption.

   Under the law giving the purchaser the rents during the year of redemption, the purchaser of land under the statutory foreclosure of a mortgage can recover rent from the lessee of the owner as fast as the rent falls due on the lease, and payment by the lessee to the lessor after notice of the purchaser’s rights is no defense.

   Assignment of rents agreement given with the real estate mortgage was enforceable by the mortgagee prior to foreclosure of the mortgage; this section deals with rents and profits during the period of redemption, and has no bearing on the mortgagee’s rights under the assignment of rents agreement prior to foreclosure.

   “Rent”, within the contemplation of this section, can come into being only by agreement. Kuiper v. Miller, 53 N.D. 711, 207 N.W. 489, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>

   In the absence of a contract to the contrary, a mortgagor is entitled to the possession, rents, use, and benefit of mortgaged premises until foreclosure and expiration of the period of redemption. Olson v. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co., 60 N.D. 671, 235 N.W. 722, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1931).
       </p>
       <p>

   A statute entitling a debtor under an execution or foreclosure sale to possession of the property sold during the period of redemption does not preclude the mortgagor and mortgagee in the contract from providing for possession in the mortgagee, although the parties cannot by contract, as part of the same transaction, take from the mortgagor the right to the possession of rents and profits during the redemption period. Fargo Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Rice, 66 N.D. 100, 262 N.W. 345, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing within this section provides that a mortgagor’s interest in rents and profits is protected, except during the redemption period following a foreclosure sale, as against a mortgagee holding an interest based upon a valid assignment of rents. Union State Bank v. Cook, 63 B.R. 789 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since during the redemption period a debtor has, under this section, the right to possession, rents, use and benefit of the property, and he could quite properly lease the land out to others, in exchange for allowing debtor to remain in possession past date mortgagee was entitled to protection of possessory interest, mortgagee was entitled to adequate protection in the form of the rental payments normally expected on the land for the crop year to be secured by a lien on the mortgagor’s share of the crop.

But it is not waste for the person in possession of the property at the time of the sale, or entitled to possession afterwards, during the period allowed for redemption, to continue to use it in the manner in which it previously was used, or to use it in the ordinary course of husbandry, or to make the necessary repairs of buildings thereon, or to use wood or timber on the property therefor, or for the repair of fences, or for fuel for that person’s family, while that person occupies the property.

      Instead of the order requiring the attendance of the judgment debtor, the judge, upon proof by affidavit or otherwise to the judge’s satisfaction that there is danger that the debtor will leave the state or attempt to avoid being found and that there is reason to believe that the debtor has property which the debtor unjustly refuses to apply to such judgment, may issue a warrant requiring the sheriff of any county where such debtor may be to arrest and bring the debtor before such judge. Upon being brought before the judge, the debtor may be examined on oath and, if it then appears that there is danger that the debtor will leave the state and that the debtor has property that the debtor has refused unjustly to apply to such judgment, the debtor may be ordered to enter into an undertaking with one or more sureties that the debtor from time to time will attend before the judge as directed and that during the pendency of the proceedings the debtor will not dispose of any portion of the debtor’s property not exempt from execution. In default of entering into such undertaking, the debtor may be committed to jail by warrant of the judge as for contempt.

      If it appears that a person, corporation, or limited liability company alleged to have property of the judgment debtor, or to be indebted to the judgment debtor, claims an interest in the property adverse to the judgment debtor or denies the debt, such interest or debt is recoverable only in an action against such person, corporation, or limited liability company by the receiver, but the judge by order may forbid a transfer or other disposition of such property or interest until a sufficient opportunity is given to the receiver to commence the action and prosecute the same to judgment and execution. Such order may be modified or dissolved by the judge granting the same at any time on such security as the judge shall direct.

        N.D.C.C. §§ 28-25-14, 13-02.1-07(1), do not require tort plaintiffs to file separate suits in order to set aside alleged fraudulent transfers of property by the individuals or entities sued in the tort suit. North Dakota law does not prohibit a plaintiff from adjudicating both a tort claim and a related fraudulent transfer claim in the same lawsuit, and N.D.R.Civ.P. 8(e)(2) allows plaintiffs to state many separate claims in the same complaint, regardless of whether or not they are based on legal grounds, equitable grounds, or both.

        State court had jurisdiction to set aside the fraudulent transfer of three condominiums by a brother who was sued in a tort action after it rendered a judgment in an assault victim’s favor.

   District court erred in awarding attorney’s fees under this section because the personal representative’s responsive pleading did not adequately provide reasons the petition to determine validity of a will was frivolous, and the frivolous nature was not apparent. Harr v. Behle (In re Estate of Behle), 2021 ND 199, 966 N.W.2d 551, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 203</cite> (N.D. 2021).

   Affirmance of a summary judgment on appeal does not mean that a claim was frivolous. Soentgen v. Quain &amp; Ramstad Clinic, P.C., 467 N.W.2d 73, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   Affirmance of a summary judgment on appeal does not necessarily mean that a claim is frivolous. Industrial Comm'n v. McKenzie County Nat'l Bank, 518 N.W.2d 174, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   The mere fact that summary judgment was granted below and affirmed on appeal did not render the plaintiff’s claim frivolous and entitle defendants to attorney’s fees. Strom-Sell v.

   The 1977 amendment, which authorized the awarding of attorney fees for frivolous claims, became effective July 1, 1977, and is not retroactive in its application. In re Estate of Nelson, 281 N.W.2d 245, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>

   Despite fact that defendant was granted a summary judgment in a libel action, it was an abuse of discretion for trial court to award attorney fees to the defendant on the basis of plaintiff’s claim being frivolous where there was not such a complete absence of actual fact or law that a reasonable person could not have thought a court would render judgment in plaintiff’s favor. Moritz v. Medical Arts Clinic, P. C., 315 N.W.2d 458, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 224</cite> (N.D. 1982).

   Putative father, who had previously acknowledged paternity, was not entitled to attorney fees and costs incurred in defending against mother’s motion for temporary support during the pendency of the paternity action where the relative financial positions of the parties disclosed a situation in which the need for child support was urgent and mother’s affidavit in support of her motion reflected such financial positions. M. v. S., 315 N.W.2d 683, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   A trial court’s failure to deny a motion for summary judgment should not preclude an award of attorney’s fees against a party for pursuing frivolous claims after subsequent proceedings made it apparent to the trial court that the claims were clearly frivolous.

   Napoleon Livestock Auction v. Rohrich, 406 N.W.2d 346, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 310</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   The supreme court will not reverse an award of attorney’s fees pursuant to subsection 2 of this section absent an abuse of discretion by the trial court. Brakke v. Rudnick, 409 N.W.2d 326, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 343</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>

   The trial court properly dismissed, the plaintiffs’ complaint against certain named defendants for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because they were not alleged to have caused any injury to the plaintiffs, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that this complaint was frivolous as to those defendants and awarding the attorney’s fees because there was such a complete absence of facts or law as to those defendants that a reasonable person could not have expected a judgment.

   An inmate’s persistence in pursuing his claims against a private, not-for-profit prison accreditation corporation after being informed of their frivolous nature by the district court, and in failing to cooperate in preparing an appendix, entitled the corporation to double costs as well as attorney’s fees in the amount of $250.

   Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the defendant attorney fees incurred in defending a frivolous claim once again in petitioner’s post-trial motions where the vast majority of her arguments in those motions related to her meritless claim that testator’s will was a “court-made will,” such argument being made without factual basis and having been repeatedly rejected by the trial court in pretrial rulings and rulings made during the trial.

   Upon an appeal from a decision of the workmen’s compensation bureau, reasonable attorney’s fees to be fixed by the trial judge are taxable as costs to a prevailing appellant only. Feist v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 80 N.W.2d 100, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   Whether a noncontractual duty to indemnify, or an actual intent to injure are exceptions to the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers compensation statutes are open questions; therefore, an attempt to assert one of those exceptions does not merit the imposition of attorney fees as a sanction.

        This section could not bar recovery of attorney’s fees under 11 USCS § 506(b), where security agreement provided for recoupment of attorney’s fees in bankruptcy proceedings. First W. Bank &amp; Trust v. Drewes (In re Schriock Constr.), 104 F.3d 200, 1997 U.S. App. LEXIS 205 (8th Cir. N.D. 1997).

       <p>
        
   The provision for payment of attorney fees in a Basic Loan Agreement where the language in the Basic Loan Agreement specifically obligated the borrower to pay attorney fees “except where and to the extent prohibited by applicable law” was void under this section; however, only the provision for payment of attorney fees was voided, and the debt was not extinguished.

   A commercial lease which includes an attorney fee arrangement is not “evidence of debt” and does not violate public policy under this section given that the language “evidence of debt,” as contemplated by this section, relates to a written instrument importing on its face the existence of debt, an acknowledgment of that debt, and a promise of payment, and is not so broad as to include anything that could demonstrate evidence of debt. T.F. James Co. v. Vakoch, 2001 ND 112, 628 N.W.2d 298, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 2001).

   Although attorneys’ fees can be awarded if agreed by the parties, either expressly or impliedly, such an agreement is limited by this section. Farmers Union Oil Co. v. Maixner, 376 N.W.2d 43, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 414</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   The judgment rendered by the district court which authorized a bank to sell the collateral and apply the proceeds from the sale toward the cost of repossession, cost of sale, attorney’s fees and legal expenses incurred by the bank in its action on a defaulted installment contract was defective insofar as it authorized attorney’s fees and legal expenses to be recovered out of the sale proceeds.

       </h5>
       <p>
        
   “Other evidence of debt” includes a personal guarantee of payment agreement, because the guarantee relates to the payment of debt. Where attorneys’ fees were awarded because of a personal guarantee, and as the personal guarantee was a document relating to the payment of a debt, the attorneys’ fees were awarded in violation of this section. Farmers Union Oil Co. v. Maixner, 376 N.W.2d 43, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 414</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   District court erred in denying a son’s motion for attorney fees as against public policy and void because the parties’ settlement agreement and mutual release of claims was not “evidence of debt” where, while the settlement agreement contained multiple provisions that obligated the son to pay installments to the parents to resolve their litigation claims, the agreement did not reflect an instrument involved in a typical debtor-creditor relationship, instead, the parties freely negotiated the settlement agreement, and the agreement contained mutual obligations and mutual releases of claims. Candee v. Candee, 2019 ND 94, 925 N.W.2d 423, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   District court erred in denying a motion filed by a landlord’s assignee for attorneys’ fees and costs because the provision for attorney’s fees in the personal guaranty agreement was not void where the lease explicitly contemplated and assigned to the assignee any claims against the tenant for property damage, the guaranty was executed at the same time as the lease, there was no existing debt when the lease or guaranty was executed, and the guaranty was not a promise to pay an existing debt. Big Pines, LLC v. Baker, 2020 ND 64, 940 N.W.2d 616, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       <p>
        
   A promissory note providing for the payment of attorney’s fees and the cost of collection is nonnegotiable and, if fraudulently changed after execution, the note becomes void and the debt extinguished. First Nat'l Bank v. Laughlin, 4 N.D. 391, 61 N.W. 473, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 49</cite> (N.D. 1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The stipulation in a promissory note for the payment of attorney’s fees in case of default is contrary to public policy and is void, and will not be enforced by the courts even though the instrument was executed in a foreign state where such provision is valid. Continental Supply Co. v. Syndicate Trust Co., 52 N.D. 209, 202 N.W. 404, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 127</cite> (N.D. 1924).

   Because the provisions for cost-shifting in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-15s32-15-32" target="_blank">32-15-32</a></cite> are “specific,” the generalized cost-shifting provisions of N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 54(e), and subsection (5) of this section do not apply in eminent domain proceedings under chapter 32-15, and the trial court has no statutory authority to assess the costs and fees of a city’s expert appraiser against defendants. City of Jamestown v. Leevers Supermarkets, 552 N.W.2d 365, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1996).

   Landowners’
   
   tort claims were not “rooted” in any taking, but were based upon the independent grounds of nuisance and negligence, and they were actions and claims for relief entirely separate and distinct from the inverse condemnation claims, and the city was required to muster separate defenses to each claim; joining the tort claims with inverse condemnation claims did not preclude taxation of costs for the separate tort claims under N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(e) and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-26s28-26-06" target="_self">28-26-06</a></cite>, and the district court did not err in concluding it could tax costs for the tort claims against the landowners.
   
   Hager v. City of Devils Lake, 2009 ND 180, 773 N.W.2d 420, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2009).

While the husband and wife argued that they should not have to pay for the time the expert spent learning about helmet usage, the expert was asked several questions during his deposition about helmet usage, and it was reasonable for him to read articles regarding helmet usage prior to trial.

   District court properly awarded costs to an owner as the prevailing party because what a city described as multiple inverse condemnation claims were merely several theories of damage, and the city was not eligible to recover costs where the cited statutes did not apply to eminent domain proceedings.

   Where the trial court ultimately upheld major portions of the County’s flood control plan, but the landowners’ action to challenge the County’s plan resulted in a stipulation incorporated in the judgment requiring all culverts be installed at riverbed level, both sides prevailed and there was no single “prevailing party” against whom disbursements could be taxed.

   Companies argued the district court erred in taxing the expenses of converting documents to database ready images, but the trial court determined these were expenses of procuring evidence obtained for use at trial and allowed them, and this was not an abuse of discretion.

   Because a district court erred in granting directed verdict in favor of landowners on their due process claim, the district court also erred in failing to determine the township prevailed by successfully defending the suit. Remand to the district court was appropriate for determination of costs. Arnegard v. Arnegard Twp., 2018 ND 80, 908 N.W.2d 737, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 2018).

   District court abused its discretion in awarding the employee her mediation fees as allowable costs and erred in awarding her electronic research fees as part of her costs, because the parties contractually agreed to share mediation expenses, and electronic legal research fees were a component of attorney fees and could not be separately taxed as costs.

   Costs incurred on the first trial could not be taxed by plaintiff even though he prevailed on the second trial. Taylor v. Minneapolis St. P. &amp; S. St. M. Ry., 63 N.D. 332, 248 N.W. 268, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1933).

   In the second trial in the former client’s malpractice action against an attorney, the trial court did not err by not awarding the attorney costs and disbursements under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-26s28-26-06" target="_self">28-26-06</a></cite> for both the first and second trials because the attorney was not the prevailing party in the first trial even though the action was dismissed where the trial court judgment was reversed and remanded for a second trial due to an improper instruction of the jury and not due to the client’s fault. It is inappropriate to award costs from a previous trial where a subsequent trial is held after remand, particularly where the party to be taxed costs and disbursements was not at fault for necessitating the subsequent trial; and the attorney’s minimal unopposed counterclaim in the first trial did not permit an award of costs and disbursements.

   Trial court did not abuse its discretion in its award of costs and disbursements for defendants in informed consent case where, although the notice of entry of judgment did not include an attached statement of costs and disbursements, plaintiff had notice of the statement of costs and disbursements, which was served on plaintiff a month before the notice of entry of judgment, and objected to costs and disbursements.

   Where the plaintiff’s inability to recover damages from the defendant in accordance with the jury’s verdict was due solely to the fact that the damages assessed were offset by medical expense payments already paid by a no-fault automobile insurer, the plaintiff remained the prevailing party and there was no abuse of discretion in the trial court awarding her costs.

   Trial court did not abuse its discretion in vacating a judgment where judgment failed to consider no-fault benefit payments and N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 68 offers, and plaintiffs cannot be awarded costs and disbursements under a vacated judgment; however, plaintiffs should have been allowed costs and disbursements for the period of time before the N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 68 offers were made because they were the prevailing parties.

   A prevailing party determination under this section is a question of law regarding whether a party is a prevailing party entitled to necessary disbursements, and not a question of fact regarding whether the awarded costs and their amounts were proper. Braunberger v. Interstate Eng'g, Inc., 2000 ND 45, 607 N.W.2d 904, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 2000).

   Plaintiff was not a prevailing party in litigation where he failed to prevail on any significant issue in his action and where defendant prevailed on all significant isues including the main issue of his counterclaim.

   Where a judgment was originally rendered in a patient’s favor in his professional malpractice action against a social worker, and an amended judgment vacated the taxation of costs against the social worker upon a determination that neither party was the prevailing party, such was error because the judgment had been rendered in favor of the patient regardless of the fact that no damages were awarded; accordingly, he was entitled to a cost award.

      In the case of a defendant in a civil action in a district court against whom no personal claim is made, the plaintiff may deliver to such defendant with the summons a notice subscribed by the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s attorney, setting forth the general object of the action and a brief description of the property affected by it, if it affects specific real or personal property, and stating that no personal claim is made against such defendant. If a defendant on whom such notice is served unreasonably defends the action, the defendant shall pay costs to the plaintiff.

      In an action for assault, battery, false imprisonment, libel, slander, malicious prosecution, criminal conversation, or seduction, if the plaintiff recovers less than fifty dollars damages, the plaintiff may recover no more costs and disbursements than damages. In an action to recover the possession of personal property, if the plaintiff recovers less than fifty dollars damages, the plaintiff may recover no more costs and disbursements than damages, unless the plaintiff recovers property also, the value of which with the damages amounts to fifty dollars, or the possession of property is adjudged to the plaintiff, the value of which with the damages amounts to fifty dollars. Such value must be determined by the jury, court, or referee by whom the action is tried. When several actions are brought on one bond, recognizance, promissory note, bill of exchange, or other instrument in writing, or in any other case for the same claim for relief against several parties who might have been joined as defendants in the same action, no costs other than disbursements may be allowed to the plaintiff in more than one of such actions, which must be at the plaintiff’s election, if the party or parties proceeded against in such action or actions, at the time of the commencement of the previous action or actions, has been openly within this state and not secreted.

       <p>
        
   Attorney fees and costs taxed pursuant to this section are to be summarily taxed by the trial court at the trial; party was not entitled to attorney fees or costs where he did not request such before seeking summary judgment, which was granted in his favor and constituted a trial within the meaning of this section, but waited until after the summary judgment had been appealed and affirmed, before making such request in a subsequent proceeding.

   In construing an appeal statute, the language and context thereof, the purpose to be attained, and the relative interest and rights of the parties in the subject matter involved must be considered. Helland v. Jones, 76 N.D. 511, 37 N.W.2d 513 (1949), decided prior to the enactment of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.39.html#t39c39-06s39-06-39" target="_blank">39-06-39</a></cite>.

   Dismissal of a third-party complaint “without prejudice” was a judgment, and as such appealable, even though such dismissal was not a final determination of the rights of the litigants. Danks v. Holland, 246 N.W.2d 86, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 1976).

   Father had not waived his right to appeal by merely registering the initial 2001 judgment and the February 2005 order in Maryland, because, it was undisputed that both parties and the child were residing in North Dakota when the instant child custody proceeding was commenced in March 2004 and, the Supreme Court of North Dakota had jurisdiction under N.D.

VI, § 6, and N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-27s28-27-01" target="_self">28-27-01</a></cite>, <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-27s28-27-02" target="_self">28-27-02</a></cite>, over the amended appeal and cross-appeal to review the district court’s final amended judgment.

   When a lessee sued a sublessee for breach of contract and the sublessee filed third-party claims against the lessor’s heirs, dismissal of the lessee’s claims with prejudice and the sublessee’s claims without prejudice was appealable because the dismissals practically terminated the litigation.

   Supreme Court of North Dakota had jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the district court’s order resolving the co-personal representatives’ competing petitions to remove the other as a personal representative in an unsupervised estate because the order was an appealable order in that the order constituted a concluding order on the petitions and resolved all proceedings pending at that time as the order also resolved one co-personal representative’s request for attorney’s fees.

   Supreme Court of North Dakota lacked jurisdiction over a municipal court judgment denying petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief, because the appeal was not authorized by statute.

   There has been a shift in the appellate procedure regarding the applicability of Rule 54(b) certification to orders that are appealable pursuant to this section. To the extent that Geo-Mobile, Inc. v. Dean Bender Chevrolet, 386 N.W.2d 918 (N.D. 1986) appeared to sanction an appeal from a denial of a motion to amend a complaint without the additional requirement of a Rule 54(b) certification, it was overruled. Where the record contained no Rule 54(b) certification pertaining to the trial court’s ruling on plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint, and his claims against defendant remained pending below, the supreme court was without jurisdiction to consider that issue on appeal. Peterson v. Zerr, 443 N.W.2d 293, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 127</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   An order denying a motion to amend is appealable only if it fulfills one of the criteria of this section and only if there is a N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 54(b) order certifying the trial court’s ruling on the motion as a final judgment.

   A determination as to whether the Supreme Court of North Dakota has jurisdiction to hear an appeal involves a two-step process: First, the order appealed from must meet one of the statutory criteria of appealability set forth in this section. If it does not, the court’s inquiry need go no further and the appeal must be dismissed. If it does, then N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 54(b), must be complied with. If it is not, the court is without jurisdiction. State ex rel. Preszler v. Common Title Bond &amp; Trust, 435 N.W.2d 693, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 1989).

   Default judgment which was “partial” default judgment because it left the issue of damages pending was an appealable order under subsection 5 of this section and did need to be accompanied by a N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 54(b) certification. However, although there was no Rule 54(b) order in the record certifying either the default judgment or the order denying the motion to vacate the default judgment as a final judgment, the partial default judgment on the issue of liability eliminated any defenses to liability. This so affected the fundamental merits of the case that the Supreme Court would consider the appeal as a request to exercise supervisory jurisdiction and, exercising discretion, would consider the issues on their merits. Thompson v. Goetz, 455 N.W.2d 580, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Res judicata doctrine’s final judgment requirement was satisfied with regard to a state court’s ex parte order setting aside, as fraudulent, the transfers of three condominiums from a brother to his sister because even though pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 28-27-02(7), ex parte orders were generally not appealable, the brother could have appealed the order under N.D.C.C § 28-27-02(7) if he had requested a hearing on the issue or moved to vacate the ex parte order. Having failed to make such requests, the brother waived his right to appeal and the ex parte order became final for res judicata purposes.

   An order denying the trial of a case by a jury and holding that the case is properly triable by the court is not appealable. Schutt v. Federal Land Bank, 71 N.D. 640, 3 N.W.2d 417, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1942).

   Order denying jury trial is an interlocutory nonappealable order, but is reviewable when there is an appeal from a final judgment. United Hosp. v. Hagen, 285 N.W.2d 586, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 316</cite> (N.D. 1979).

       </h5>
       <p>
        
   Memorandum decisions by trial courts are not appealable and orders issuing from such decisions are appealable only if they fall within the statutory definition as given in this section; an order allowing plaintiff to proceed as if by default unless defendant filed an answer within thirty days of the date of the order was not appealable. Nord v. Koppang, 131 N.W.2d 617, 1964 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Memorandum decision which denied defendants’ motion to reopen default judgment and directed plaintiffs’ attorney to prepare and submit a final order was not an appealable order. Chas. F. Ellis Agency v. Berg, 214 N.W.2d 507, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Where notice of appeal recited that the appeal was from a memorandum opinion, the appeal was permitted where the memorandum opinion contained an order of dismissal, from which an appeal is permitted. Hospital Servs. v. Dumas, 297 N.W.2d 320, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 284</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   While in civil cases a memorandum decision is generally not appealable, when the memorandum opinion contains an order which was intended to be a final order and the order is one from which an appeal may be taken pursuant to statute, the appeal will be treated as an appeal from the order contained in the memorandum opinion; the same standard should be applied in criminal cases. State v. Gelvin, 318 N.W.2d 302, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 326</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 987, 103 S. Ct. 341, 74 L. Ed. 2d 383, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 4231 (U.S. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   This section does not provide for an appeal from a memorandum decision. Where the judgment entered carried out and was consistent with the memo signed by the court and order for judgment signed by the court, the reviewing court would treat the appeal as an appeal from the judgment and, accordingly, discuss the merits of the appeal. Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Albrecht, 379 N.W.2d 266, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 453</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Insofar as a party may appeal from a “memo” of summary judgment, it logically follows that the reviewing court must permit a motion to vacate such an order by requiring trial courts to treat the motion as one to vacate the summary judgment. This also allows the court to reach the merits of the case, which is important, especially in a situation akin to a default. Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Albrecht, 379 N.W.2d 266, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 453</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   Order denying inmate’s motion for the appointment of a private attorney to prosecute the inmate’s wife and others for adultery and unlawful cohabitation was not appealable, and given the dubious nature of the inmate’s marriage, the reasonable probability of not obtaining a conviction, and the inmate’s failure to report the events to any law enforcement agency, the Supreme Court declined to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to issue a supervisory writ.

   Not only could husband in a divorce case not appeal to the state supreme court the divorce judgment, because there was no final judgment and no certification allowing for an appeal as to less than all of the claims, but the husband also could not appeal the trial court’s order on the wife’s post-judgment motions requesting changes to the financial provisions of the divorce judgment.

   Supreme court did not have jurisdiction to consider the appeal of Native Americans where the district court dismissed all plaintiffs except one from the action, “without prejudice,” because he was the only plaintiff who had complied with N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.32.html#t32c32-12s32-12-03" target="_blank">32-12-03</a></cite>, and the dismissal of the other plaintiffs was the only aspect of the order challenged on appeal, because dismissal without prejudice neither terminated the litigation in state court nor necessarily barred the action and claim for tax refunds under the statute of limitations.

   Supreme court exercised its discretion to review an issue raised in a mother's case because the mother had been incarcerated solely for contempt for well over 400 straight days, and the issue raised in the case was a question of first impression and involved a district court's authority to incarcerate persons found to be in contempt of court indefinitely; the issue was one of vital concern regarding matters of important public interest.

   Where a motion to substitute a personal representative for a deceased party in a pending action is resisted on the ground that the cause of action does not survive, there is inherent in the court’s decision on the motion a question of substantial rights as to whether the cause of action survives the death which intrinsically involves the merits of the action, and an order granting the motion and directing the substitution is appealable under this section.

   It is generally recognized that an order denying a motion for summary judgment is not one of the orders reviewable (meaning appealable) under this section. Klindtworth v. Burkett, 477 N.W.2d 176, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   A denial of a motion for summary judgment does not in effect determine the action preventing a judgment from which an appeal might be taken, nor does it finally determine the merits or some part thereof.

   An order granting a motion for a hearing on the question of opening or vacating a judgment is not an appealable order. Smith v. Smith, 71 N.D. 110, 299 N.W. 693, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1941).

   Where a judgment has been irregularly entered upon the general verdict of the jury and the aggrieved party moves to vacate the judgment and enter judgment in conformity with the verdict, an order denying the motion is appealable. Mielcarek v. Riske, 74 N.D. 202, 21 N.W.2d 218, 1945 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1945).

   An order denying a motion to quash an order to show cause why a judgment should not be vacated and to deny the application to vacate the judgment is not appealable. Schillerstrom v. Schillerstrom, 74 N.D. 761, 24 N.W.2d 734, 1946 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 98</cite> (N.D. 1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Order or judgment absolutely vacating judgment previously entered, leaving action pending below, is purely interlocutory and is not appealable; when judgment has been vacated and retrial ordered with restrictions, the validity of the restrictions will be determined only upon appeal from the final judgment. William Clairmont, Inc. v. Burlington N., 229 N.W.2d 77, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1975).

   Since the statute of limitations expired and dismissal without prejudice effectively terminated a patient’s claims, orders on post-judgment motions for reconsideration and to vacate the judgment were sufficiently final and appealable under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-27s28-27-02" target="_self">28-27-02</a></cite>.

   The procedure by which an injunction against a foreclosure of a mortgage by advertisement may be obtained is not a special proceeding, and an appeal may not be taken from an order denying a motion to vacate such an order. Tracy v. Scott, 13 N.D. 577, 101 N.W. 905 (1904), decided prior to the enactment of § 7841, C.L. 1913 (see now N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-27s28-27-02" target="_self">28-27-02</a></cite>); distinguished, Rourke v.

       Reference to ascertain damages — Breach of undertaking.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the amount of damages to be paid by the appellant on affirmance of the judgment or order appealed from pursuant to an undertaking is not fixed by the judgment or decision of the supreme court on appeal, the district court, after the remittitur of the record from the supreme court is filed, may order a reference to ascertain such damages, the expense of which shall be included and recoverable with such damages. In all cases, a neglect for the space of thirty days after the affirmance on appeal of a judgment directing the payment of money to pay the amount directed to be paid on such affirmance must be deemed a breach of the undertaking on such appeal. A neglect for the space of sixty days after the confirmation of a report of a referee, to whom a reference has been ordered for the purpose of ascertaining the damages to be paid on the affirmance of any other judgment or order appealed from, to pay the amount of damages so ascertained, and the costs of such reference must be deemed a breach of the undertaking on such appeal. The dismissal of an appeal by the appellant or by the court for want of prosecution, unless the court at the time shall order otherwise, renders the sureties upon the undertaking or bond given under this chapter liable in the same manner and to the same extent as if the judgment or order appealed from had been affirmed.

      The supreme court, without a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or a motion in the alternative for such judgment or for a new trial, first made in the trial court, may review the ruling on the motion for a directed verdict on appeal from the judgment, and may order judgment to be entered when it appears from the testimony that a verdict should have been so directed. It also may so order on appeal from an order denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or on appeal from an order denying a motion for judgment in accordance with the motion for a directed verdict if no verdict was returned. On appeal from an order made upon a motion in the alternative for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial, the court shall review the whole order and may reverse, affirm, or modify the order as to any and all parties.

Tornado &amp; Cyclone Co., 63 N.D. 418, 248 N.W. 527, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 1933).

   The question of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a verdict cannot be raised on appeal in the absence of a motion for directed verdict or a motion for a new trial. Lueck v. State, 70 N.D. 604, 296 N.W. 917, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 207</cite> (N.D. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Since 1951 amendment, specific statutory authority has existed for appeal to supreme court from order made on motion for judgment or for new trial made in accordance with motion for directed verdict, where no verdict was returned; on such appeal, supreme court is authorized to review the whole order. Gershman v. Engelstad, 160 N.W.2d 80, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 1968).

        Where an order denying a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or an order denying a motion in the alternative for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or for a new trial has become final and is no longer appealable before an appeal from the judgment is taken, such questions are not reviewable on appeal from the judgment.

   In a proper case on appeal the supreme court may order judgment non obstante veredicto, although no motion for a new trial is made in the lower court. Houston v. Minneapolis S. P. &amp; S. S. M. Ry., 25 N.D. 469, 141 N.W. 994, 1913 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 1913).

       <p>
        
   If the evidence is insufficient to sustain a verdict and it appears that there is no reasonable probability that the defects in proof may be remedied upon another trial, and that upon the whole record the party against whom the verdict was rendered is entitled to judgment upon the merits as a matter of law, the trial court should order judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and failure so to do is subject to correction on appeal. Cunningham v. Great N. Ry., 73 N.D. 315, 14 N.W.2d 753, 1944 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 65</cite> (N.D. 1944).

     <p>
      In an action to foreclose or otherwise enforce a security interest in personal property, the court in its discretion, upon the application of the debtor, may make an interlocutory order fixing a reasonable time within which the debtor shall make good the default under the security agreement and shall pay all costs of suit to date. If the debtor shows to the court, on or before the date fixed by the interlocutory order, that the debtor has made such payment, or if the debtor tenders it in court, then such action must be dismissed, otherwise, a final order for judgment for plaintiff may be made as though such interlocutory order had not been made. The court has the power to impound the personal property in controversy during the pendency of the interlocutory order at the expense of the debtor.

     <p>
      When the mortgagee has commenced foreclosure proceedings, or the vendor demands or takes possession of the property covered by the contract, and it appears by the affidavit of the mortgagor or vendee, or the mortgagor’s or vendee’s agent or attorney, to the satisfaction of the judge of the district court of the county wherein such property is situated, that the mortgagor or vendee has a legal counterclaim or is entitled to take advantage of the provisions of section 28-29-07, or has any other valid defense against the collection of the whole or any part of the amount claimed to be due, such judge, by an order to that effect, may enjoin the mortgagee from foreclosing such mortgage by advertisement, or the vendor from taking possession of or selling such property, and may direct that all further proceedings be had in the district court having jurisdiction of the subject matter. For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this section, service may be made on the mortgagee or vendor or the mortgagee’s or vendor’s attorney or agent. The provisions of this section apply to the assignee or transferee of any mortgagee or vendor and to the assignee or successor in interest of the mortgagor or vendee.

   Where the mortgagors submitted affidavits stating that prices were too low to allow them to recover even half of the cost of production and that price structures in agriculture were confiscatory, a genuine issue of material fact existed about the confiscatory price defense and summary judgment was reversed, as to that defense.

      In an original cause in the supreme court, whether in response to an order to show cause or an alternative writ of any kind, the respondent shall appear by written motion, answer, or return. This may be submitted to the supreme court without waiver at one or different times, as may best suit the convenience of the court and the parties, for purposes of expedition. Upon a hearing, the parties may present, in support of the issues, affidavits and counter affidavits. If, for the determination of controverted facts, a further hearing and additional evidence become necessary, the court, upon application made therefor, shall determine the method of taking, and the time for the return of, additional testimony, whether the same be by additional evidence, by deposition, or by oral testimony taken before the court, or by reference either to a trial court or some designated commissioner or referee.

       “Adjudicative proceeding” means an administrative matter resulting in an agency issuing an order after an opportunity for hearing is provided or required. An adjudicative proceeding includes administrative matters involving a hearing on a complaint against a specific-named respondent; a hearing on an application seeking a right, privilege, or an authorization from an agency, such as a ratemaking or licensing hearing; or a hearing on an appeal to an agency. An adjudicative proceeding includes reconsideration, rehearing, or reopening. Once an adjudicative proceeding has begun, the adjudicative proceeding includes any informal disposition of the administrative matter under section 28-32-22 or another specific statute or rule, unless the matter has been specifically converted to another type of proceeding under section 28-32-22. An adjudicative proceeding does not include a decision or order to file or not to file a complaint, or to initiate an investigation, an adjudicative proceeding, or any other proceeding before the agency, or another agency, or a court. An adjudicative proceeding does not include a decision or order to issue, reconsider, or reopen an order that precedes an opportunity for hearing or that under another section of this code is not subject to review in an adjudicative proceeding. An adjudicative proceeding does not include rulemaking under this chapter.

   The supreme court exercises restraint in its review of the findings of an administrative agency to insure that it does not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. Wiederholt v. Director, N.D. Dep't of Transp., 462 N.W.2d 445, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 219</cite> (N.D. 1990), overruled in part, Suelzle v. N.D. DOT, 2020 ND 206, 949 N.W.2d 862, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The Supreme Court reviews the agency’s decision, not the ruling of the district court. The Supreme Court does not make independent findings or substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Rather, the Supreme Court considers whether the agency reasonably reached its factual determinations from the greater weight of all the evidence. Boyce v. Backes, 488 N.W.2d 45, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The Supreme Court’s review requires a three-step process: (1) Are the agency’s findings of fact supported by a preponderance of evidence? (2) Are the conclusions of law sustained by the agencies findings of fact? (3) Is the agency’s decision supported by the conclusions of law? Kummer v. Backes, 486 N.W.2d 252, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The district court exceeded the scope of its review when it substituted its own implicit factual finding for one made by the DOT’s hearing officer. Lock v. Moore, 541 N.W.2d 84, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 231</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>
        
   The Supreme Court’s review of license suspension hearings is confined to the record before the agency. Kummer v. Backes, 486 N.W.2d 252, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   Review of the state transportation agency’s suspension of the motorist’s driver’s license was governed by the Administrative Agencies Practice Act, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-01" target="_self">28-32-01</a></cite> et seq. Accordingly, the state supreme court had to keep that law in mind in deciding whether the suspension of the motorist’s driver’s license for four years was warranted after the motorist was arrested for being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

   Chapters of manual which prescribed the method to determine who may be appropriately served by the developmental disabilities division did not deal only with internal management of the department so as to be exempt from the rulemaking requirements of chapter 28-32 pursuant to the definition of “rule” in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-01" target="_self">28-32-01</a></cite>.

       In an analysis of the takings implications of a proposed rule, “taking” means the taking of private real property, as defined in section 47-01-03, by government action which requires compensation to the owner of that property by the fifth or fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States or section 16 of article I of the Constitution of North Dakota. “Regulatory taking” means a taking of real property through the exercise of the police and regulatory powers of the state which reduces the value of the real property by more than fifty percent. However, the exercise of a police or regulatory power does not effect a taking if it substantially advances legitimate state interests, does not deny an owner economically viable use of the owner’s land, or is in accordance with applicable state or federal law.

     <p>
      A rule is invalid unless adopted in substantial compliance with this chapter. However, inadvertent failure to supply any person with a notice required by section 28-32-10 does not invalidate a rule. Notwithstanding subsection 2 of section 28-32-42, an action to contest the validity of a rule on the grounds of noncompliance with this chapter may not be commenced more than two years after the effective date of the rule.

      If the legislative management’s administrative rules committee objects to all or any portion of a rule because the committee deems it to be unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, or beyond the authority delegated to the adopting agency, the committee may file that objection in certified form with the legislative council. The filed objection must contain a concise statement of the committee’s reasons for its action.

       The legislative council shall attach to each objection a certification of the time and date of its filing and, as soon as possible, shall transmit a copy of the objection and the certification to the agency adopting the rule in question. The legislative council also shall maintain a permanent register of all committee objections.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-17ol12">
       The legislative council shall publish an objection filed pursuant to this section in the next issue of the code supplement. In case of a filed committee objection to a rule subject to the exceptions of the definition of rule in section 28-32-01, the agency shall indicate the existence of that objection adjacent to the rule in any compilation containing that rule.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-17ol13">
       Within fourteen days after the filing of a committee objection to a rule, the adopting agency shall respond in writing to the committee. After receipt of the response, the committee may withdraw or modify its objection.

      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-17ol14">
       After the filing of a committee objection, the burden of persuasion is upon the agency in any action for judicial review or for enforcement of the rule to establish that the whole or portion thereof objected to is within the procedural and substantive authority delegated to the agency. If the agency fails to meet its burden of persuasion, the court shall declare the whole or portion of the rule objected to invalid and judgment must be rendered against the agency for court costs. These court costs must include a reasonable attorney’s fee and must be payable from the appropriation of the agency which adopted the rule in question.

A rule or portion of a rule suspended under this subsection becomes permanently ineffective unless it is ratified by both houses of the legislative assembly during the next session of the legislative assembly, in which case it is effective as of the date of ratification by the second house of the legislative assembly. An agency seeking ratification of its rule shall introduce a bill for that purpose. The administrative rules committee may suspend a rule or portion of a rule if the committee makes the specific finding that, with regard to that rule or portion of a rule, there is:

Within three business days after the administrative rules committee suspends a rule, the office of the legislative council shall provide written notice of that suspension and the committee’s specific finding under subdivisions a through f of subsection 1 to the adopting agency and to the chairman of the legislative council. Within fourteen days after receipt of the notice, the adopting agency may file a petition with the chairman of the legislative council for review by the legislative council of the decision of the administrative rules committee. After receipt of the petition and before the next session of the legislative assembly, the legislative council by approval of a motion may lift the suspension and reinstate the rule’s effectiveness.

      An agency may amend or repeal a rule or create a related rule if, after consideration of rules by the administrative rules committee, the agency and committee agree that the rule amendment, repeal, or creation is necessary to address any of the considerations under subsection 1. A rule amended, repealed, or created under this subsection is not subject to the other requirements of this chapter relating to adoption of administrative rules and maybe resubmitted by the agency to the legislative council for publication as amended, repealed, or created and reconsidered by the administrative rules committee at a subsequent meeting at which public comment on the agreed rule change must be allowed.”

However, although the specification of issues could have been more precise, worker was not unfairly surprised and had an opportunity to and did address the Worker’s Compensation Bureau’s evidence on the disability question.

   The language in subsection (4) of this section incorporating evidentiary privileges to “all stages of an administrative proceeding” does not apply to the filing of information for inclusion in a tariff. The filing of a tariff does not initiate an administrative proceeding, and the filing of a rate or tariff does not make or change rates; rather, the primary purpose of filing these individually negotiated contracts is to notify the Public Service Commission (PSC) of the rates agreed to by the utility with its various customers and to allow the PSC to review those rates for irregularities.

   Revocation of the driver’s operating privileges was proper, because the first officer’s communication was presumptively reliable and his knowledge of the video was imputed to the first officer, and the second officer could then combine the communicated observation with his own observations of the driver to establish probable cause to arrest for driving under the influence (DUI); since the second officer’s testimony regarding the first officer’s statements was offered to establish whether the second officer had probable cause to arrest the driver for DUI, the hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in allowing the testimony.

     <p>
      In any adjudicative proceeding, an administrative agency may avail itself of competent and relevant information or evidence in its possession or furnished by members of its staff, or secured from any person in the course of an independent investigation conducted by the agency, in addition to the evidence presented at the hearing. It may do so after first transmitting a copy of the information or evidence or an abstract thereof to each party of record in the proceeding. The agency must afford each party, upon written request, an opportunity to examine the information or evidence and to present its own information or evidence and to cross-examine the person furnishing the information or evidence. Any further testimony that is necessary shall be taken at a hearing to be called and held, giving at least ten days’ notice. Notice must be served upon the parties in the manner allowed for service under the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. This section also applies to information officially noticed after the hearing when the issuance of any initial or final order is based in whole or in part on the facts or material noticed.

     <p>
      An agency may assess the costs of an investigation to a person found to be in violation of a statute or rule as a result of an adjudicative proceeding or informal disposition. The total costs assessed and any civil penalty that may be imposed as a result of violation may not exceed the statutorily authorized civil penalty for the violation. For the purposes of this section, costs mean reasonable out-of-pocket agency costs, not including any attorney’s fees, actually incurred in conducting the investigation for which they may be assessed. Any such costs paid must be paid into the general fund and are appropriated as a refund to the agency for the purposes of defraying the costs of undertaking the investigation.

   This section does not excuse or exempt the workers compensation bureau from holding a formal hearing, it merely exempts the bureau from the requirement of providing the parties with a written specification of the issues before holding a hearing, making an investigation or considering a claim. Steele v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 273 N.W.2d 692, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1978).

       <p>
        
   The workers compensation bureau may proceed by informal hearing in making its initial determination on a claim if a formal evidentiary hearing is afforded the claimant upon demand in any case where a dispute of material fact exists. Manikowske v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 373 N.W.2d 884, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 391</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   An evidentiary hearing before termination of workers compensation benefits would unduly burden the governmental interest because medical records will usually resolve whether the claimant can work. Rather, opportunity to respond should be limited to a written submission as an initial check against an erroneous decision. Beckler v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 418 N.W.2d 770, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1988).

      An administrative agency may grant intervention in an adjudicative proceeding to promote the interests of justice if intervention will not impair the orderly and prompt conduct of the proceeding and if the petitioning intervenor demonstrates that the petitioner’s legal rights, duties, privileges, immunities, or other legal interests may be substantially affected by the proceeding or that the petitioner qualifies as an intervenor under any provision of statute or rule. The agency may impose conditions and limitations upon intervention. The agency shall give reasonable notice of the intervention to all parties.

      Before a hearing, an administrative agency may conduct a prehearing conference after giving reasonable notice to all parties and other interested persons. A prehearing conference may be conducted in total or in part by making use of telephone, facsimile services, television, or other electronic means, as long as such use does not substantially prejudice or infringe on the rights and interests of any party.

   In an annexation dispute, an argument that fair hearing was not provided because objectors were not given adequate notice to allow them to comment before the State Board of Public School Education issued its written findings and conclusions was rejected; the record reflected that the Board deliberated, considered suggestions by its attorney, reached a consensus, announced its decision at the public hearing, and directed its attorney to draft written findings, conclusions and an order for review. There was no authority requiring that the Board give the parties notice or the opportunity to comment on its proposed order after a decision was made or before an order was issued.

   In worker’s compensation case where bureau retained experts, whose opinions it used to refute claimant’s treating physician, and then refused cross-examination of those experts unless paid for by claimant, bureau denied claimant opportunity to prove entitlement to benefits; this section required bureau to allow claimant to cross-examine those particular experts upon whose testimony bureau primarily based its findings of fact and conclusions of law, and expense of examination was borne by bureau.

   Finding against the claimant was proper because the ALJ dismissed the action as a sanction after the claimant refused to comply with the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance’s discovery request and the ALJ’s decision granting WSI’s motion to compel discovery, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-33" target="_self">28-32-33</a></cite>(1), (2). The claimant did not offer a defense for failing to comply with discovery and she made it clear that she would rather have the matter dismissed than comply with discovery.

   In proceedings to enforce an administrative subpoena, a court’s inquiry is limited to whether: (1) the subpoena is within the statutory authority of the agency; (2) the information sought is reasonably relevant to the inquiry of the administrative proceeding; (3) the subpoena is reasonably specific; and (4) the subpoena is not unduly broad or burdensome.

   County was not denied due process and a fair hearing in an unemployment benefits case where it did not subpoena former employees to testify regarding their subsequent employment history, and the only evidence in the record regarding information the claimants provided when they applied for benefits and the circumstance under which they left their subsequent employers was provided by Job Service staff.

      An administrative agency shall make a record of all testimony, written statements, documents, exhibits, and other evidence presented at any adjudicative proceeding or other administrative proceeding heard by it. Oral testimony may be taken by a court reporter, by a stenographer, or by use of an electronic recording device. All evidence presented at any proceeding before the administrative agency shall be filed with the agency. A copy of the record of any proceeding before an administrative agency, or a part thereof, must be furnished to any party to the proceeding and to any other person allowed to participate in the proceeding, upon written request submitted to the agency and upon payment of a uniform charge to be set by the agency. Any fee paid to an administrative agency for the record, or a part thereof, shall be paid into the general fund and is appropriated as a refund to the agency for the purposes of defraying the costs of preparing the record.

   Ex-parte communications between Worker’s Compensation Bureau’s outside counsel and the Bureau’s Director of Claims and Rehabilitation in which the outside counsel advised the Director of Claims to reject worker’s claim and drafted several versions of findings, conclusions and orders for the Director of Claims to review required reversal of the Bureau’s order terminating benefits and reinstatement of the Administrative Law Judge’s recommended findings, conclusions and order in favor of the worker. Scott v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 221, 587 N.W.2d 153, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 231</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The appellate court harmonized N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-01s65-01-16" target="_blank">65-01-16</a></cite>(8) and N.D.C.C. ch. 28-32 to allow the Bureau to consult with its outside litigation counsel when reviewing a pending ALJ recommendation, but to preclude those consultations from being ex parte. Lawrence v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 2000 ND 60, 608 N.W.2d 254, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 2000).

   All parties had to have the opportunity to participate in communications regarding the merits of an adjudicative proceeding; although the worker’s counsel received a copy of the letter from outside counsel to the counsel for the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) and could have replied to it, that reply may well have been presumptuous because there was no legal relationship between WSI counsel and the worker’s counsel, and WSI’s rules lacked any provision establishing the opportunity for such a reply. Therefore, substantial policy concerns were implicated by improper ex parte communications. Miller v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2004 ND 155, 684 N.W.2d 641, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 284</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Where a letter from Workforce Safety and Insurance’s outside counsel was mistakenly addressed to WSI inside counsel and then given to WSI claims director, the intended recipient, without notice and an opportunity for claimant to respond, an improper communication violating N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-37" target="_self">28-32-37</a></cite> occurred when the letter was redirected to director and the matter had to be remanded for a rehearing with the claims director disqualified from participation.

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-37" target="_self">28-32-37</a></cite>(4) does not require that communications which were not improper ex parte communications before an administrative law judge’s recommended decision must subsequently be disclosed after the decision has been made. Rather, the statute allows these communications prior to the decision but does not allow these communications to take place once the decision is made.
   
   Miller v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2006 ND 1, 707 N.W.2d 809, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 1</cite> (N.D. 2006).

   Where a teacher claimed he did not receive a fair discharge hearing, even if a school board member’s ex parte communication with a student’s parent violated N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-37" target="_self">28-32-37</a></cite> and did not fall within “general interest” communication contemplated under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-37" target="_self">28-32-37</a></cite>(9), the teacher did not show prejudice from the violation, as the outcome of his hearing would not have been different had the violation not occurred.

   A single ex parte communication between police and hearing officer did not warrant reversal of department of transportation’s decision to suspend driver’s license, though court had “heard complaints” about similar improper conduct, because judicial review must be limited to the record, which reflected only one identifiable incident of an improper act.

   Where hearing officer noticed a discrepancy among numbers listed on Intoxilyzer forms, she subpoenaed the testing officer in order to receive an explanation for that discrepancy; had the evidence revealed the use of an unauthorized solution, a fact apparently unknown to the hearing officer and not immediately apparent from the record, it would have resulted in a dismissal of the proceedings and the return of driver’s license. The Supreme Court could not conclude that the hearing officer acted with partiality in subpoenaing the officer, particularly because there is no indication she knew what the officer’s testimony would be.

   Although the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by hearing officer were sparse and thus not examples to be followed for compliance with this section, they were nonetheless adequate, as the reviewing court was able to understand the factual basis upon which the trial court reached its conclusions.

   Administrative law judge (ALJ) properly found that an employee had sustained a compensable injury and was entitled to benefits because the ALJ made specific findings regarding the ALJ’s consideration of the evidence presented at the hearing, weighed the doctors’ competing opinions; because the ALJ had the opportunity to observe witnesses and the responsibility to assess the credibility of witnesses and resolve the conflicts in the evidence, the supreme court would not reweigh the evidence.

   In an annexation dispute, an argument that fair hearing was not provided because objectors were not given adequate notice to allow them to comment before the State Board of Public School Education issued its written findings and conclusions was rejected; the record reflected that the Board deliberated, considered suggestions by its attorney, reached a consensus, announced its decision at the public hearing, and directed its attorney to draft written findings, conclusions and an order for review. There was no authority requiring that the Board give the parties notice or the opportunity to comment on its proposed order after a decision was made or before an order was issued.

       <p>
        
   Doctor requested a continuance to personally appear before the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners at its March 19, 2004, meeting, but, at that meeting, the Board instituted proceedings on the March 19, 2004, complaint, which incorporated the seven allegations of inappropriate care and inappropriate documentation from the 2003 complaint, plus three additional claims of inappropriate care, and then delayed disposition on the administrative law judge’s recommended sanction for the 2003 complaint; the delay in the adoption of an order in the 2003 case was effectively superseded by the 2004 action and the Board’s temporary suspension of the doctor’s license continued until completion of the 2004 case. The statutes did not preclude the Board from temporarily suspending the doctor’s license and initiating a new proceeding that incorporated the allegations from the 2003 complaint; thus, the Board’s action in delaying disposition on the 2003 complaint did not preclude the Board from considering the cumulative effect of the conduct from that complaint in the proceedings on the 2004 complaint, including the determination of an appropriate sanction.

   Where expert medical testimony is desirable if not essential to a determination of causation of an injury, the workers compensation bureau may not simply ignore competent medical testimony without expressly setting forth in its findings of fact adequate reasons, which are supported by the record, for doing so. Satrom v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 328 N.W.2d 824, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 393</cite> (N.D. 1982).

   This section is clearly premised upon a prior evidentiary hearing having been held. A petition for rehearing of a denial of benefits following an informal hearing by the workers compensation bureau is in reality a request for an initial hearing, and a claimant should not be required to make a “further showing” before being afforded a hearing under those circumstances. Thus, this section must be applied differently in this situation. Manikowske v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 373 N.W.2d 884, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   When a motorist sent letters containing his request for “first of all a reopening of the administrative hearing . . . as a second choice an appeal to the District Court or whatever” to the hearing officer regarding the administrative suspension of his driver’s license, the Department of Transportation concluded that the motorist sought reconsideration of the order; the hearing officer then sent the motorist directions regarding proper petitions for reconsideration, and the motorist complied with the procedure.

   The public service commission has discretionary power to reopen a case after remand upon an appeal, but where the only changes made in the order of the commission after remand are those required by the decision of the appellate court, no rehearing or notice is necessary.

   Former section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-14" target="_self">28-32-14</a></cite> (now <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-40" target="_self">28-32-40</a></cite>) is clearly premised upon a prior evidentiary hearing having been held. A petition for rehearing of a denial of benefits following an informal hearing by the workers compensation bureau is in reality a request for an initial hearing, and a claimant should not be required to make a “further showing” before being afforded a hearing under those circumstances. Thus, section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-40" target="_self">28-32-40</a></cite> must be applied differently in this situation. Manikowske v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 373 N.W.2d 884, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 391</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   A workers compensation claimant could not claim the hearing was unfair when she shortcut the process by appealing to the district court rather than requesting an evidentiary rehearing.
   
   In re Claim of Olson, 419 N.W.2d 894, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The district court had jurisdiction to hear claimant’s appeal from an order of the Workers Compensation Bureau; the order became a final, appealable order 30 days after the claimant filed a petition for reconsideration and the Bureau had taken no action. Lende v. N.D. Workers' Comp. Bureau, 1997 ND 178, 568 N.W.2d 755, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The Workers Compensation Bureau is not required to schedule and hold a hearing within 30 days of the filing of a petition for reconsideration; nevertheless, the plain meaning of “dispose of” requires some affirmative action on the part of the Bureau in furtherance of arranging and providing the formal hearing to which the claimant has a right. Lende v. N.D. Workers' Comp. Bureau, 1997 ND 178, 568 N.W.2d 755, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   A claimant seeking review of a Workers Compensation Bureau order denying benefits need not exhaust administrative remedies before appealing to the district court. Lende v. N.D. Workers' Comp. Bureau, 1997 ND 178, 568 N.W.2d 755, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Where Workers’ Compensation Bureau has issued an informal decision denying benefits and an evidentiary hearing results in a final Bureau order denying benefits, the claimant may request reconsideration under this subsection. Boger v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 1998 ND 131, 581 N.W.2d 463, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 1998).

      Unless a later date is stated in the order, a final order of an administrative agency is effective immediately, but a party may not be required to comply with a final order unless it has been served upon the party and notice is deemed given pursuant to section 28-32-39 or the party has actual knowledge of the final order. A nonparty may not be required to comply with a final order unless the agency has made the final order available for public inspection and copying or the nonparty has actual knowledge of the final order.

   The filing of a document showing proof of some service is sufficient under this section to confer jurisdiction on the district court, at least for the limited purpose of allowing the proof of service to be corrected to accurately reflect the facts. In other words, an inaccurate but timely filed proof of service may be the basis for a hearing to determine the actual facts surrounding the service upon proper motion.

In reversing the decision, the district court erred in finding that the ALJ’s findings of fact were not supported by the greater weight of evidence, because the scope of appeal was limited to the specifications of error filed under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-42" target="_self">28-32-42</a></cite>(4) and claimant conceded the findings of fact were not in error.

   The Workers Compensation Bureau is not required to schedule and hold a hearing within 30 days of the filing of a petition for reconsideration; nevertheless, the plain meaning of “dispose of” requires some affirmative action on the part of the Bureau in furtherance of arranging and providing the formal hearing to which the claimant has a right.

       <p>
        
   The 30-day appeal period never began to run because the Workers Compensation Bureau never served claimant with a notice of a final determination upon reconsideration after the order become final, and thus claimant’s appeal was timely.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If an application for leave to offer additional testimony, written statements, documents, exhibits, or other evidence is made to the court in which an appeal from a determination of an administrative agency is pending, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is relevant and material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to offer the evidence in the hearing or proceeding, or that the evidence is relevant and material to the issues involved and was rejected or excluded by the agency, the court may order that the additional evidence be taken, heard, and considered by the agency on terms and conditions as the court may deem proper. After considering the additional evidence, the administrative agency may amend or reject its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order and shall file with the court a transcript of the additional evidence with its new or amended findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order, if any, which constitute a part of the record with the court.

   Before leave to adduce additional evidence is granted, court must find both that the additional evidence sought to be introduced is material, and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence at the administrative hearing. Insurance Servs. Office v. Knutson, 283 N.W.2d 395, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 293</cite> (N.D. 1979).

        The district court’s denial of a motion for leave to adduce additional evidence was affirmed, where, when the workers’ compensation claimant filed that motion, nearly two years had passed since he had sought benefits from the workers compensation bureau and his claims had been the subject of one hearing and two rehearings, and he made no showing before the district court that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing or proceeding had before the administrative agency.

In view of job service’s position, that the subject of qualifying work was too complex for its personnel to understand and properly advise job applicants, there were reasonable grounds for the failure of an uninformed applicant to develop all the evidence at the hearing.

   A party may apply to the court in which an appeal is pending for leave to offer additional evidence; if the court finds the additional evidence is material and there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce the evidence at the administrative hearing, the court may order the additional evidence be taken, heard and considered on terms and conditions as it deems proper.

   Where physician and his counsel chose not to attend administrative hearing and did not present any evidence at the hearing, the physician failed to prove reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce evidence and, therefore, district court properly denied physician’s motion for leave to offer additional evidence while his appeal of license revocation was pending.

   Argument on appeal that the driver was unable to offer evidence about the inoperability of the vehicle because he learned about the absence of the ignition key for the first time at the administrative hearing was overruled because the driver did not provide reasonable grounds for the failure to offer evidence in the hearing, and therefore, the standard for remanding the matter for consideration of additional evidence under this section had not been satisfied. Rist v. N.D. DOT, 2003 ND 113, 665 N.W.2d 45, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 127</cite> (N.D. 2003).

   District court did not err in failing to consider an employee’s new information because the employee did not attempt to supplement the record by using the procedure provided by the statute; even when used, the statute was consistent with the supreme court’s separation of powers holdings in other administrative appeals because a motion under the statutewould result in the new evidence being reviewed by the agency and not the district court.

   In a workers’ compensation case, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the claimant’s motion to supplement the record because the medical records at issue had been introduced at an administrative hearing predating the administrative hearing. The records were known to and available to the claimant at the time of the hearing before the administrative law judge.

       Scope of and procedure on appeal from determination of administrative agency.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A judge of the district court must review an appeal from the determination of an administrative agency based only on the record filed with the court. After a hearing, the filing of briefs, or other disposition of the matter as the judge may reasonably require, the court must affirm the order of the agency unless it finds that any of the following are present:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-46ol11">
       The order is not in accordance with the law.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-46ol12">
       The order is in violation of the constitutional rights of the appellant.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-46ol13">
       The provisions of this chapter have not been complied with in the proceedings before the agency.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-46ol14">
       The rules or procedure of the agency have not afforded the appellant a fair hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-46ol15">
       The findings of fact made by the agency are not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-46ol16">
       The conclusions of law and order of the agency are not supported by its findings of fact.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-46ol17">
       The findings of fact made by the agency do not sufficiently address the evidence presented to the agency by the appellant.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-32s28-32-46ol18">
       The conclusions of law and order of the agency do not sufficiently explain the agency’s rationale for not adopting any contrary recommendations by a hearing officer or an administrative law judge.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If the order of the agency is not affirmed by the court, it must be modified or reversed, and the case shall be remanded to the agency for disposition in accordance with the order of the court.

   All parties had to have the opportunity to participate in communications regarding the merits of an adjudicative proceeding; although the worker’s counsel received a copy of the letter from outside counsel to the counsel for the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) and could have replied to it, that reply may well have been presumptuous because there was no legal relationship between WSI counsel and the worker’s counsel, and WSI’s rules lacked any provision establishing the opportunity for such a reply. Therefore, substantial policy concerns were implicated by improper ex parte communications, thus implicating N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite>(4).

   In a dispute regarding the issuance of a North Dakota Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, the North Dakota Department of Health complied with the permitting process because, under former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.23.html#t23c23-01s23-01-23" target="_blank">23-01-23</a></cite>, the hearings conducted were not adjudicative proceedings. Further, an arbitrary and capricious standard of review was applicable because there was not an adjudicative proceeding, and the general standard of review of agency’s findings for adjudicative proceedings under
   
   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite> was incompatible with the procedural posture of the case. The Health Department’s decision was entitled to even greater deference than a proceeding after an adjudicative proceeding, and the Health Department’s permitting decision was thus reviewed to determine whether it was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable, particularly in light of the fact that the subject matter was complex or technical and involved agency expertise.

Since the evidence supported the administrative law judge’s (ALJ) decision that found the claimant had not shown that the claimant’s right shoulder pain was substantially worsened by the claimant’s work injury and vocational training, and because the evidence supported the ALJ’s finding as to the claimant’s earning capacity, the state supreme court had to uphold the ALJ’s decision.

   In medical disciplinary proceedings, the North Dakota State Board of Medical Examiners was the ultimate fact finder and consisted mostly of physicians who were trained and experienced in the profession, which, coupled with the procedural safeguards envisioned by the medical disciplinary procedural statutes, minimized the risk of error. Thus, the preponderance of evidence standard for medical disciplinary proceedings satisfied due process.

       <p>
        
   Use of the preponderance of evidence standard for medical disciplinary actions does not violate equal protection even though North Dakota law imposes a more rigorous clear and convincing standard of proof for attorney disciplinary proceedings because (1) the attorney representing a client in a legal action is often in an adversarial role where one party wins and one party loses; (2) physicians are not engaged in the adversarial relationship on behalf of the patient and there is not a necessary loser resulting from the physician-patient relationship; and (3) the higher standard of proof for attorney discipline weeds out unwarranted complaints by unhappy litigants.

   Where the trust language was ambiguous, requiring extrinsic evidence to determine intent, a reasoning mind could have reasonably concluded that the decedent’s primary intent was to provide support and care for his disabled sister and that the trust created by the will was a support trust; thus, the department of human services did not err in considering the trust corpus as an available asset when it denied medical assistance benefits.

   Department of human services’ interpretation of certain regulations as to eligibility for medical assistance benefits was unreasonable as it created a built-in delay in the award of benefits to needy persons, placed administrative expediency ahead of factual need, exalted form over substance, and ignored the department’s mandate to provide administrative processes which are efficient and in the best interests of the applicant; thus its decision was not in accordance with the law as embodied in the administrative rules.

   For purposes of setting the health center’s 2001 Medicaid reimbursement rate, the North Dakota Department of Human Services properly found that the health center’s nursing department helpers were not nurse aides for purposes of direct care costs under N.D. Admin. Code § 75-02-06-02.2(2) because federal Medicaid law required the health center’s nursing department helpers to be certified, or working on certification, to be classified as nurse aides for the 2001 rate year, and the health center’s nursing department helpers were not certified or working on certification; thus, pursuant to N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-49" target="_self">28-32-49</a></cite>, the district court erred when it reversed the Department’s determination that the health center’s non-certified nursing department helpers were not nurse aides.

   Revocation of the petitioner’s driving privileges was proper, because the petitioner had a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney, when the petitioner waited over ten minutes before making a call, and rather than calling an attorney the petitioner called a friend; based on the testimony regarding the petitioner’s continued attempts to change the focus of the investigation, his refusal to follow instructions and his complaints about being uncomfortable in the officer’s patrol vehicle, a reasonable mind could have determined the petitioner was trying to delay the investigation.

   Revocation of a driving under the influence of alcohol arrestee's driving privileges was proper because a preponderance of the evidence supported the hearing officer's factual finding that the arrestee did not request to speak with an attorney before submitting to a chemical test; the arrestee's reference to “lawyer up,” which was mixed in with a barrage of profanity launched at the deputy was beyond the bright line standard against which a purported request for an attorney were judged.

   District court did not err in affirming the order suspending the driver's driving privileges for refusing a breath test because a reasoning mind could have concluded the driver failed to consent to the test, and thus, failed to cure his earlier refusal since he did not unconditionally consent to the breath test; a person seeking to cure a prior refusal had to do so clearly and could not complain of an officer's reasonable interpretation of a conditional statement of willingness to take a test.

   In reviewing the agency’s factual findings relating to an administrative suspension of a driver’s license for driving while impaired by alcohol, the district court failed to exercise clearly established principles of law by using his personal experience in driving streets in the area where the traffic stop occurred.

       <p>
        
   Driver’s license was not suspended according to law because, when the driver did not timely request an administrative hearing, it was error for a hearing officer to conclude the Department of Transportation had no jurisdiction, as the issue was whether that jurisdiction was properly invoked, which it was not, so the license could only be administratively revoked, and it was error to conduct a hearing.

Brunner v. Ward County Social Servs. Bd., 520 N.W.2d 228, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 1994); Ollie v.

   District court must review record on appeal from decision of workmen’s compensation bureau to determine whether evidence supports such decision. Burkhardt v. State, 78 N.D. 818, 53 N.W.2d 394, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1952).

   District court is to hear appeals from revocation of liquor license by attorney general, without a jury and solely on record made on attorney general’s hearing. State v. Jorda, 74 N.W.2d 95, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   On appeal from reversal of determination by public service commission by trial court, review was limited to whether findings of fact were supported by evidence and conclusions of law by its findings of fact. Northern Pac. Ry. v. Anderson, 95 N.W.2d 582, 1959 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   On appeal from the decision of the public service commission evidence for consideration by the court is confined to the record certified and filed with the court.

       </p>
       <p>
        
   Appeal to the district court from a decision of the workmen’s compensation bureau is restricted to the record made and certified by the bureau, and it is improper for the district court to receive new evidence which has not been presented to the bureau. Knutson v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 120 N.W.2d 880, 1963 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The district court is required to review the evidence and, if it determines that the agency’s findings of fact are not supported by the evidence, to reverse the agency’s decision. Beck v. Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 141 N.W.2d 784, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1966).

       <p>
        
   Where public service commission denied power company’s application for certificate of public convenience and necessity to provide service to resident, trial court properly affirmed commission’s decision since court under this section does not have power to determine administrative questions within purview of commission. In re Otter Tail Power Co., 169 N.W.2d 415, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1969).

       <p>
        
   After determination has been made that the findings of fact are supported by the evidence or conceded to be supported by the evidence, the only review for the supreme court is to determine whether or not the conclusions and decision of the agency are supported by the findings of fact. Haugland v. North Dakota Employment Sec. Bureau, 218 N.W.2d 181, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 230</cite> (N.D. 1974).

   The evidence considered by the district court and by the supreme court shall be confined to the record of the administrative hearing filed with the court. First Am. Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Ellwein, 221 N.W.2d 509, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1026, 95 S. Ct. 505, 42 L. Ed. 2d 301, 1974 U.S. LEXIS 3421 (U.S. 1974).

   This section controls the scope of judicial review of an administrative agency’s decision, and has not been superseded by Rule 52(a), North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure; in ruling upon whether findings of facts made by an agency are “supported by the evidence”, the substantial-evidence rule is followed. O'Brien v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 222 N.W.2d 379, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1974); Tri-County Elec. Coop. v. Elkin, 224 N.W.2d 785, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1974); State Hosp. v. North Dakota Employment Sec. Bureau, 239 N.W.2d 819, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 206</cite> (N.D. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   State supreme court’s review of factual basis of administrative agency orders is three-step process: “(1) Are the findings of fact supported by substantial evidence? (2) Are the conclusions of law sustained by the findings of fact? (3) Is the agency decision supported by the conclusions of law”? Bank of Hamilton v. State Banking Bd., 236 N.W.2d 921, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Supreme court must look to the record compiled before the administrative agency itself, rather than to the findings of the district court, upon review of the evidence. North Dakota Real Estate Comm'n v. Allen, 271 N.W.2d 593, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1978); Barnes County v. Garrison Diversion Conservancy Dist., 312 N.W.2d 20, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 402</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Supreme court will affirm an agency’s decision only if the conclusions and decision of the agency are supported by findings of fact and the findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. In re Retail Liquor License No. 15, 283 N.W.2d 170, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 286</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Supreme court’s scope of review is rather limited and involves a three-step process: (1) Are the findings of fact supported by a preponderance of the evidence? (2) Are the conclusions of law sustained by the findings of fact? (3) Is the agency decision supported by the conclusions of law? Asbridge v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 291 N.W.2d 739, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1980); County of Stutsman v. State Historical Soc'y, 371 N.W.2d 321, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 354</cite> (N.D. 1985); Otto v. Job Serv. N.D., 390 N.W.2d 550, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 360</cite> (N.D. 1986); Skjefte v. Job Serv. N.D., 392 N.W.2d 815, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 391</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Supreme court is required to affirm the decision of the workers compensation bureau unless the bureau’s findings of fact are not supported by the preponderance of the evidence or its conclusions of law are not supported by its findings of fact. Inglis v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 312 N.W.2d 318, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 405</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   On appeal from a decision of an administrative agency, the supreme court applies the preponderance of the evidence standard in reviewing the findings of fact; under such standard, the supreme court does not make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency, but determines only whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have determined that the factual conclusions reached were proved by the weight of the evidence from the entire record. Roberts v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 326 N.W.2d 201, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 383</cite> (N.D. 1982); Otto v. Job Serv. N.D., 390 N.W.2d 550, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 360</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The supreme court on review does not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Olson v. Job Serv. N.D., 379 N.W.2d 285, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 447</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The supreme court on review looks to the decision of the administrative agency rather than the decision of the district court. Olson v. Job Serv. N.D., 379 N.W.2d 285, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 447</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The court reviews the decision of the agency rather than the decision of the district court, and accordingly looks to the record compiled by the agency. Otto v. Job Serv. N.D., 390 N.W.2d 550, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 360</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   In determining whether or not the bureau’s findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the reviewing court is not free to substitute its judgment for that of the bureau. Instead, the court’s task is to determine only whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have determined that the factual conclusions reached were proved by the weight of the evidence from the entire record. Grace v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 395 N.W.2d 576, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 425</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   On appeal of disciplinary action against a real estate broker, the supreme court reviews the real estate commission’s decision rather than the district court’s, and, like the district court, applies the standards of review for an administrative agency decision given in this section. Wisdom v. State, 403 N.W.2d 19, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 278</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   When an administrative agency decision is appealed to the district court and then to the supreme court, the supreme court reviews the decision of the administrative agency and not the decision of the district court. Montana-Dakota Utils. Co. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 413 N.W.2d 308, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 407</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The supreme court reviews the record compiled by the agency, but the analysis of the district court is entitled to respect if it is sound. Domek v. North Dakota State Personnel Bd., 430 N.W.2d 339, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   When reviewing an administrative agency decision, the supreme court takes into account whether the agency could have reasonably reached its factual determinations by the greater weight of all the evidence. Domek v. North Dakota State Personnel Bd., 430 N.W.2d 339, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Because applicability of, compliance with, and the validity of those portions of the state personnel policies manual not published in the Administrative Code were not raised as issues in the administrative agency proceeding, those issues had not been preserved for review. Choukalos v. North Dakota State Personnel Bd., 429 N.W.2d 441, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   In assessing whether an agency’s findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the supreme court will determine only whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have determined that the factual conclusions reached were proved by the weight of the evidence from the entire record. Bickler v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 423 N.W.2d 146, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   In order to determine whether an agency decision is in accordance with the law, the supreme court looks to the law and its application to the facts. Bickler v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 423 N.W.2d 146, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reviewing the determination of an administrative agency, the supreme court looks to the decision of the agency and not the district court in its adjudication of the matter. 409 N.W.2d 344.
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Review of administrative decisions is governed by this section, which requires the supreme court to affirm: (1) if the decision is in accordance with the law; (2) if the findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (3) if the conclusions of law are sustained by the findings of fact; and (4) if the agency decision is supported by the conclusions of law. S.W. v. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs., 420 N.W.2d 344, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The interpretation of administrative regulations is a question of law. Administrative agency decisions on questions of law are fully reviewable by a court.
   
   Redwood Village Partnership v. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs., 420 N.W.2d 333, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Review of administrative agency decisions is governed by this section, and involves a three-step process: (1) Are the findings of fact supported by a preponderance of the evidence? (2) Are the conclusions of law sustained by the findings of fact? (3) Is the agency decision supported by the conclusions of law? Evans v. Backes, 437 N.W.2d 848, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       <p>
        
   This section requires the court to affirm the Workers Compensation Bureau’s decision unless its findings of fact are not supported by a preponderance of the evidence or unless its conclusions of law are not supported by its findings. In determining whether the Bureau’s findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the court determines only whether a reasoning mind could have reasonably determined that the factual conclusions were supported by the weight of the evidence. Ehli v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 447 N.W.2d 313, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 1989); Risch v.

   The supreme court’s review of administrative agency decisions is governed by this section and involves a three-step process: (1) Are the findings of fact supported by a preponderance of the evidence? (2) Are the conclusions of law sustained by the findings of fact? (3) Is the agency decision supported by the conclusions of law? Miller v. North Dakota Crime Victims Reparations Bd., 448 N.W.2d 197, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   There are three questions involved in reviewing the factual basis of an administrative agency decision: (1) Are the findings of fact supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) Are the conclusions of law sustained by the findings of fact; and (3) Is the agency decision supported by the conclusions of law? Sletten v. Briggs, 448 N.W.2d 607, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1080, 110 S. Ct. 1135, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1041, 1990 U.S. LEXIS 805 (U.S. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   When the Supreme Court reviews an administrative agency decision, it considers whether the agency could have reasonably reached its factual determinations by the greater weight of all the evidence. Heinrich v. North Dakota State Highway Comm'r, 449 N.W.2d 587, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 237</cite> (N.D. 1989).

   The Supreme Court’s review of administrative agency decisions is governed by this section and requires a three-step process to determine: (1) If the findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of evidence; (2) if the conclusions of law are sustained by the findings of fact; and (3) if the agency decision is supported by the conclusions of law. Darnell v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 450 N.W.2d 721, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1990).

   This section governs the scope of judicial review of the bureau’s decision in both the district court and in the Supreme Court. Jones v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 461 N.W.2d 273, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 202</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Pursuant to this section the court will affirm a Workers’ Compensation Bureau decision unless its findings of fact are not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, its conclusions of law are not sustained by the findings of fact, its decision is not supported by its conclusions of law, or its decision is not in accordance with the law. Jones v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 461 N.W.2d 273, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 202</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   When reviewing the decision of an administrative hearing, the supreme court is limited to the determination of the following: (1) Is the decision of the agency in accordance with the law? (2) Is the decision of the agency in violation of the appellant’s constitutional right? (3) Have the provisions of chapter 28-32 been complied with? (4) Was the appellant given a fair hearing? (5) Are the findings of fact supported by a preponderance of the evidence? (6) Are the conclusions of law sustained by the findings of fact? (7) Is the agency decision supported by the conclusions of law? Wiederholt v. Director, N.D. Dep't of Transp., 462 N.W.2d 445, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        
   The review of the factual basis of an administrative decision requires a three-step process to determine: (1) If the findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence; (2) if the conclusions of law are sustained by the findings of fact; and (3) if the agency decision is supported by the conclusions of law. 466 N.W.2d 148; Hakanson v. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs., 479 N.W.2d 809, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 15</cite> (N.D. 1992); Johnson v.

       </p>
       <p>
        
   The bureau’s decision must be affirmed unless the court concludes that the findings of fact are not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, that the conclusions of law are not supported by the findings, or that the decision is not in accordance with law. Schiff v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 480 N.W.2d 732, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   Supreme court will affirm an administrative agency decision unless one of the enumerated reasons for not affirming the agency listed in this section is found to exist. Hakanson v. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs., 479 N.W.2d 809, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 15</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>
        
   In determining whether an administrative agency’s findings of fact are supported by a preponderance of the evidence, the courts do not make independent findings of fact or substitute their judgment for that of the agency; rather, the courts determine only whether a reasoning mind could have reasonably determined that its factual conclusions were supported by the evidence. Pleinis v. North Dakota Workers Compensation Bureau, 472 N.W.2d 459, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   When the court examines findings of fact made by an administrative decision-maker, the court looks to see if they are supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Salvaggio v. North Dakota Dep't of Transp., 477 N.W.2d 195, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   In reviewing an agency’s findings the court does not make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency. The court only determines whether a reasoning mind could reasonably have determined that the factual conclusions reached were proved by the weight of the evidence. Grotte v. North Dakota Workers' Compensation Bureau, 489 N.W.2d 875, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 178</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   The Supreme Court will affirm the Workers’ Compensation Bureau’s decision unless a preponderance of the evidence does not support its findings of fact, its findings do not support its conclusions of law, its conclusions do not support its decision, or its decision is not in accordance with the law.

   Whether an employee’s behavior is misconduct depends in part on the nature of the work and presents a mixed question of fact and law and Supreme Court review of a mixed question of fact and law involves a determination of whether the evidence supports the agency’s findings of fact and, in turn, whether those findings of fact sustain the agency’s conclusion; on disputed facts, Supreme Court will defer to the agency’s findings and consider only whether a reasoning mind could have reasonably determined that the factual conclusions were proved by a preponderance of the evidence. When the agency’s conclusion of law regarding misconduct is based on undisputed facts and contradictory inferences cannot reasonably be drawn from the undisputed facts, the Supreme Court will review that conclusion anew. Proserve Corp. v. Rainey, 536 N.W.2d 373, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 1995).

   The district court made independent findings of fact and substituted its judgment for that of the Workers’ Compensation Bureau, which a reviewing court may not do, and employed an improper standard of review to reverse the bureau’s order.

   When claimant was injured at work and received temporary total disability benefits, he filed a claim for additional benefits three years later; North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance properly denied his reapplication for benefits under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-05s65-05-08" target="_blank">65-05-08</a></cite>(1), because claimant did not show an actual wage loss caused by a significant change in his compensable medical condition. In reversing the decision, the district court erred in finding that the ALJ’s findings of fact were not supported by the greater weight of evidence, because the scope of appeal under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite> was limited to the specifications of error and claimant conceded the findings of fact were not in error.

   District court properly applied the arbitrary and capricious standard of review to the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality’s decision to issue an air quality permit to construct a refinery as the Department exercised significant discretion in issuing a final permit.

   North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality had not acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably in issuing an air quality permit to construct a refinery where it reasonably considered the impact of the permit conditions restricting other pollutants in calculating the refinery’s potential to emit hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and determined the facility would not be a major source of HAPs, and the Department had considered and addressed the significant comments, including volatile organic compound monitoring.

   Where claim was heard and initially decided by the bureau prior to the effective date of the amendment of this section changing the standard of review on appeal of the bureau’s finding of facts from supported by substantial evidence to supported by a preponderance of the evidence, supreme court applied the substantial evidence standard on its review even though claimant’s petition for a rehearing by the bureau was denied after the effective date of the preponderance standard amendment.

   Where the preponderance of evidence standard on review was in effect when workers compensation bureau made its initial decision on worker’s claim for benefits, such standard was applicable on appeal of that decision to the district and supreme courts despite fact that the injury giving rise to the claim occurred before the 1977 amendment changing the standard on review from substantial evidence to a preponderance of evidence.

   In reviewing the board’s findings of fact, the court does not make independent findings or substitute its judgment for that of the board; instead, it decides whether a reasoning mind could have reasonably decided the board’s factual conclusions are supported by the weight of the evidence. Volesky v. North Dakota Game &amp; Fish Dep't, 1997 ND 140, 566 N.W.2d 812, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1997).

   In affirming a district court’s judgment, which affirmed a Workforce Safety and Insurance decision, the supreme court applied the same standard of review as the district court in concluding that the worker failed to provide sufficient evidence of a good cause for her failure to attend an independent medical examination. The agency’s findings of fact were supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

As a result, they could conclude that the Department did not err in determining that the nonrecurring cost of a work truck incurred and paid in one year should not be deducted in calculating the beneficiary’s anticipated income from self-employment for the next year in determining whether the beneficiary was still eligible for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.

   Revocation of the driver’s operating privileges was proper, because the first officer’s communication was presumptively reliable and his knowledge of the video was imputed to the first officer, and the second officer could then combine the communicated observation with his own observations of the driver to establish probable cause to arrest for driving under the influence (DUI); since the second officer’s testimony regarding the first officer’s statements was offered to establish whether the second officer had probable cause to arrest the driver for DUI, the hearing officer did not abuse his discretion in allowing the testimony.

   On an appeal of the decision of an administrative agency, the supreme court will review the decision of the agency, not the decision of the district court. The scope of review is governed by this section.

   The loss of driving privileges is not insubstantial, and may entail economic hardship and personal inconvenience, and the court would not sanction suspension or revocation of that privilege based upon evidence that was no more reliable than an anonymous letter; the hearing officer erred in admitting the disputed documents, and because these documents provided the sole basis for the license suspensions, DOT’s findings of fact were not supported by a preponderance of the admissible evidence and the orders of suspension were reversed.

   Suspension of appellant’s driving privileges by the North Dakota Department of Transportation was supported by a preponderance of the evidence where a police officer found appellant on an interstate exit ramp, passed out in the driver’s seat of the vehicle with the keys in the ignition.

   Suspension of the licensee’s driving privileges for 180 days for DUI was appropriate because the officer had probable cause to arrest since witnesses described the vehicle involved in the accident, it was registered to the licensee, and the officer found the licensee extremely intoxicated. Because the officer had probable cause to arrest the licensee and had a right to remain at his elbow at all times, the officer did not violate the licensee’s Fourth Amendment rights by following him into his bedroom without a warrant.

   After a deputy saw that the driver had bloodshot eyes and was slurring his speech, the deputy had reasonable suspicion that he was in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol; the deputy did not violate the Fourth Amendment by asking the driver for a second time to unlock the door and to exit the vehicle. In the absence of a constitutional violation, the Supreme Court of North Dakota upheld the administrative suspension of his driver’s license in accordance with the standard of review set forth in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite>.

   North Dakota Department of Transportation violated plaintiff driver’s right to due process at a license suspension hearing when it took the arresting officer’s testimony telephonically under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-35" target="_self">28-32-35</a></cite> without providing notice to plaintiff; the hearing officer could not see the police officer to judge his demeanor or determine if he was testifying from notes. The officer was also unable to diagram the roadway where the stop occurred or demonstrate how he conducted the field sobriety test; because this led to an unfair hearing, the Supreme Court of North Dakota was required to reverse the suspension in accordance with N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite>.

   Motorist did not demonstrate that the state transportation agency’s decision to suspend the motorist’s driver’s license for four years after the motorist was arrested for being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was infirm under any of the grounds listed in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite> for overturning agency decisions. As a result, the state supreme court had to uphold that decision, as its review of the agency’s findings and decision as directed by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-49" target="_self">28-32-49</a></cite> did not provide it with a reason to agree with the motorist that the arresting police officer lacked probable cause to arrest the motorist for that offense, which provided the ground to suspend the motorist’s driver’s license.

   Administrative hearing officer properly suspended a motorist’s driving privileges for 180 days for driving under the influence of alcohol because the police officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop the vehicle based on his observations of the motorist’s vehicle continuously and gradually weaving, and his training and experience in the investigation of driving under the influence cases.

   In a worker’s compensation action, the phrase “in the course of employment” refers to factors relating to time and place and generally requires the claimant to place the injury within the boundaries of employment; these time and place factors are essentially factual inquiries, best entrusted to the workers compensation bureau’s experienced judgment, and review is limited to whether or not the bureau’s finding is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. Cody v. North Dakota Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 413 N.W.2d 316, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 409</cite> (N.D. 1987).

   The court must affirm workers compensation bureau decisions unless its findings of fact are not supported by a preponderance of the evidence or its conclusions are not supported by its findings of fact.

   Where the workers compensation bureau ignored the testimony of three doctors indicating aggravation of the claimant’s chondromalacia by stair climbing, but it was obvious that the claimant suffered considerable impact to her knees from the repetitive climbing of stairs during her work, the findings of fact made by the agency were not supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and by ignoring the effect of the distinctive conditions of her job, the bureau did not make a just determination of her claim.

   Former employee’s reapplication for benefits for a 1983 lower back injury was properly denied because the employee was unable to show that there was an actual wage loss as a result of the worsening of the prior injury; the evidence showed that the employee was able to perform the job until terminated for misconduct, and the employee was not eligible for further benefits until all of the requirements of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-05s65-05-08" target="_blank">65-05-08</a></cite>(1) were satisfied.

   Reviewing court overruled the claimant’s argument that her due process rights were violated when the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) in 2001 issued a retroactive Notice of Intention to Discontinue/Reduce Benefits (NOID) advising her that her disability benefits would be terminated effective December 15, 1999 because, although the claimant had received disability benefits following her 1995 injury, those benefits were terminated in 1997, and the claimant received no ongoing disability benefits either before or after her 1999 injury which would trigger due process protections; the WSI’s practice of issuing a lump sum disability award for a closed, limited period of time and simultaneously issuing a retroactive NOID did not trigger due process considerations if the claimant was not receiving ongoing disability benefits at the time of the WSI’s decision.

     </h3>
     <p>
      An appeal from an order or the rulemaking action of an administrative agency or the commission does not stay the enforcement of the order or the effect of a published rule unless the court to which the appeal is taken, upon application and after a hearing or the submission of briefs, orders a stay. The court may impose terms and conditions for a stay of the enforcement of the order or for a stay in the effect of a published rule. This section does not prohibit the operation of an automatic stay upon the enforcement of an administrative order or commission order as may be required by another statute.

   Employee did not show good cause for failing to comply with a vocational rehabilitation plan because it was fundamental error for an administrative law judge to conclude that the employee did not have to comply until the employee's appeal of an order establishing the plan was determined, as (1) the employee did not assert this as a ground for noncompliance, and (2) the employee was not relieved of compliance, absent a stay, until the appeal was resolved.

      The judgment of the district court in an appeal from an order or rulemaking action of an administrative agency or the commission may be reviewed in the supreme court on appeal in the same manner as provided in section 28-32-46 or 28-32-47, except that the appeal to the supreme court must be taken within sixty days after the service of the notice of entry of judgment in the district court. Any party of record, including the agency or commission, may take an appeal from the final judgment of the district court to the supreme court. If an appeal from the judgment of the district court is taken by an agency or the commission, the agency or commission may not be required to pay a docket fee or file a bond for costs or equivalent security.

   For purposes of setting the health center’s 2001 Medicaid reimbursement rate, the North Dakota Department of Human Services properly found that the health center’s nursing department helpers were not nurse aides for purposes of direct care costs under N.D. Admin. Code § 75-02-06-02.2(2) because federal Medicaid law required the health center’s nursing department helpers to be certified, or working on certification, to be classified as nurse aides for the 2001 rate year, and the health center’s nursing department helpers were not certified or working on certification; thus, pursuant to N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-49" target="_self">28-32-49</a></cite>, the district court erred when it reversed the Department’s determination that the health center’s non-certified nursing department helpers were not nurse aides. St. Benedict's Health Ctr. v. N.D. Dep't of Human Servs., 2004 ND 63, 677 N.W.2d 202, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 2004).

   Where claimant sold land to her son through a mortgage deed and the son later executed a satisfaction of the mortgage under a power of attorney granted by the claimant and claimant failed to show that the mortgage satisfaction was entered based upon sufficient consideration and failed to show that she would have been unsuccessful in exercising her legal rights to set aside the satisfaction of the mortgage, the court properly upheld the denial of a claimant’s application for Medicaid benefits as the determination that the claimant failed to establish her eligibility for benefits was supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

   Denial of medicaid payment for out-of-state medical care was supported by a preponderance of the evidence, because the doctor testified the child was in stable condition when he was transferred to a Minnesota hospital, the doctor testified there was not an emergency, and the care the child required was available at a neonatal intensive care unit in North Dakota.

   Revocation of the petitioner’s driving privileges was proper, because the petitioner had a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney, when the petitioner waited over ten minutes before making a call, and rather than calling an attorney the petitioner called a friend; based on the testimony regarding the petitioner’s continued attempts to change the focus of the investigation, his refusal to follow instructions and his complaints about being uncomfortable in the officer’s patrol vehicle, a reasonable mind could have determined the petitioner was trying to delay the investigation.

   In the past the supreme court has held, when reviewing an appeal brought forth from an order, that it had no statutory authorization. At this time and in the future, the supreme court will consider an appeal to be properly before it when the appeal is from an “order” and the record includes a “judgment” which is consistent with the order. In the interest of justice, this is a prudent change which will preserve those appeals which, but for an error by the appellant, would have been reviewed on their merits. Olson v. Job Serv.

         Review of Workforce Safety and Insurance Decisions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        
   Court upheld an order from the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) denying further disability and vocational rehabilitation benefits to an employee because the results of a functional capacity assessment on the employee represented a manipulated effort and an invalid representation of the employee’s physical capabilities. A reasoning mind could reasonably find, as WSI did, that the finding of noncompliance was proven by the weight of the evidence on the entire record.
   
   Thomas v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2005 ND 52, 692 N.W.2d 901, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Reviewing court overruled the claimant’s argument that her due process rights were violated when the Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) in 2001 issued a retroactive Notice of Intention to Discontinue/Reduce Benefits (NOID) advising her that her disability benefits would be terminated effective December 15, 1999 because, although the claimant had received disability benefits following her 1995 injury, those benefits were terminated in 1997, and the claimant received no ongoing disability benefits either before or after her 1999 injury which would trigger due process protections; the WSI’s practice of issuing a lump sum disability award for a closed, limited period of time and simultaneously issuing a retroactive NOID did not trigger due process considerations if the claimant was not receiving ongoing disability benefits at the time of the WSI’s decision.
   
   Ziesch v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2006 ND 99, 713 N.W.2d 525, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Workforce Safety and Insurance correctly interpreted the plain language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-01s65-01-02" target="_blank">65-01-02</a></cite>(5)(b) and did not err in calculating the claimant’s average weekly wage, because the reviewing court could not agree with the suggestion that some deductions were to be added to net profit from Schedule C of a self-employed worker’s federal tax return to calculate average weekly wage, when the 2003 statutory amendment expressly removed the provision requiring that certain business deductions and depreciation be added back in.
   
   Olson v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2008 ND 59, 747 N.W.2d 71, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        
   Workforce safety and insurance benefits were denied because a claimant did not establish that his increased pain, increased need for medical care, and increased need for medication constituted a substantial worsening or acceleration of his preexisting back condition under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-01s65-01-02" target="_blank">65-01-02</a></cite>(10)(b)(7); the inconsistencies in the medical opinions were adequately addressed, and adequate reasons were given for disregarding evidence favorable to the claimant.

   Where a doctor opined that claimant’s work in the oil field was not a substantial contributing factor in his cervical and thoracic conditions, the North Dakota Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance Fund (WSI) adequately explained its reasons for disregarding medical evidence favorable to claimant and denying benefits to treat his cervical and thoracic spine conditions. In accordance with N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-49" target="_self">28-32-49</a></cite>, the North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed WSI’s decision because it was supported by the findings of fact.

   ALJ’s finding that an injured employee was capable of performing the job of sheet metal worker identified in his vocational rehabilitation plan was supported by a preponderance of the evidence where his testimony, the testimony of his vocational manager, and the physical requirements of the job listed in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles established that kneeling was not a common job requirement.

   Administrative law judge (ALJ) properly found that an employee had sustained a compensable injury and was entitled to benefits because the ALJ made specific findings regarding the ALJ’s consideration of the evidence presented at the hearing, weighed the doctors’ competing opinions; because the ALJ had the opportunity to observe witnesses and the responsibility to assess the credibility of witnesses and resolve the conflicts in the evidence, the supreme court would not reweigh the evidence.

Because the scope of appeal under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-46" target="_self">28-32-46</a></cite> was limited to the specifications of error and claimant conceded the findings of fact were not in error, the Supreme Court of North Dakota reinstated WSI’s decision on review pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-49" target="_self">28-32-49</a></cite>.

   The following standards apply when the district court or the North Dakota supreme court reviews the decision of an administrative agency: (1) The court does not make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency, but determines only whether a reasoning mind could have reasonably determined that the factual conclusions were supported by the weight of the evidence; (2) the court exercises restraint when it reviews administrative agency findings; (3) it is not the function of the judiciary to act as a super board when reviewing administrative agency determinations; and (4) it will not substitute its judgment for that of qualified experts in the administrative agencies.

   A position may be justified, despite being incorrect, so long as a reasonable person could think that it has a reasonable basis in law and fact; substantial justification represents a middle ground between the automatic award of fees to the prevailing party on one side, and awarding fees only when a position is frivolous or completely without merit on the other.

   Because a benefit claimant’s total disability was determined prior to the 1989 and 1993 effective dates of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-05s65-05-09.2" target="_blank">65-05-09.2</a></cite>, the North Dakota Workforce Safety and Insurance (WSI) was unable to offset the claimant’s retirement benefits against his workers compensation disability benefits due to the claimant’s reliance interest in benefits and the obligation to pay by WSI. However, attorney fees and costs were not awarded since WSI did not act without substantial justification under the standard utilized in the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C.S. § 2412 because at least one judge agreed with the position advanced by WSI and it was a close question regarding unsettled law. Tedford v. Workforce Safety &amp; Ins., 2007 ND 142, 738 N.W.2d 29, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 2007).

   Even though the employer did not ultimately prevail in its effort to decline paying the widow death benefits due to the death of decedent, the employer’s position that unusual work-related stress was not at least 50 percent of the cause of decedent’s fatal heart attack was substantially justified because a reasonable person could have believed its position was correct. A cardiologist and a family medicine doctor opined that the alleged unusual work-related stress was not the cause of the heart attack and that decedent had some heart attack risk factors that were unrelated to work, which meant that the trial court could deny the widow’s N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_self">28-32-50</a></cite> attorney fee request based on a claim that the employer’s refusal pay benefits was not substantially justified.

   Trial court erred in affirming the decision of Workforce Safety &amp; Insurance (WSI) to pay a claimant only $9,876 for costs and attorney’s fees after he won his appeal to have his benefits reinstated, based upon the maximum amount WSI could pay under the fee cap in N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-02s65-02-08" target="_blank">65-02-08</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.65.html#t65c65-10s65-10-03" target="_blank">65-10-03</a></cite>, because the general attorney fee provision for administrative actions, N.D.C.C.§ <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-32s28-32-50" target="_self">28-32-50</a></cite>, could apply to WSI cases where the claimant alleged that WSI acted without substantial justification in reducing or denying benefits.

Substantial justification means, justified in substance or in the main, that is, justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person; a position is substantially justified if a reasonable person could think the position is correct, and the position has a reasonable basis in law and fact. The burden is on the agency to prove it acted with substantial justification.

      This section, to the extent that it is not inconsistent with procedural rules adopted by the North Dakota supreme court, governs any appeal provided by statute from the decision of a local governing body, except those court reviews provided under sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.02.html#t02c2-04s2-04-11" target="_blank">2-04-11</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-51.2s40-51.2-15" target="_blank">40-51.2-15</a></cite>. For the purposes of this section, “local governing body” includes any officer, board, commission, resource or conservation district, or other political subdivision. Each appeal is governed by the following procedure:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t28c28-34s28-34-01ol11">
       The notice of appeal must be filed with the clerk of the court within thirty days after the decision of the local governing body. A copy of the notice of appeal must be served on the local governing body in the manner provided by rule 4 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-34s28-34-01ol12">
       The appellee shall prepare and file a single copy of the record on appeal with the court. Within thirty days, or such longer time as the court by order may direct, after the notice of appeal has been filed in the court, and after the deposit by the appellant of the estimated cost of a transcript of the evidence, the local governing body shall prepare and file in the office of the clerk of the court in which the appeal is pending the original or a certified copy of the entire proceedings before the local governing body, or such abstract of the record as may be agreed upon and stipulated by the parties, including the pleadings, notices, transcripts of all testimony taken, exhibits, reports or memoranda, exceptions or objections, briefs, findings of fact, proposed findings of fact submitted to the local governing body, and the decision of the local governing body in the proceedings. If the notice of appeal specifies that no exception or objection is made to the local governing body’s findings of fact, and that the appeal is concerned only with the local governing body’s conclusions based on the facts found by it, the evidence submitted at the hearing before the local governing body must be omitted from the record filed in the court. The court may permit amendments or additions to the record to complete the record.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c28-34s28-34-01ol13">
       If the court determines on its own motion or if an application for leave to adduce additional evidence is made to the court in which an appeal from a determination from a local governing body is pending, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there are reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing or proceeding had before the local governing body, or that such evidence is material to the issues involved and was rejected or excluded by the local governing body, the court may order that such additional evidence be taken, heard, and considered by the local governing body on such terms and conditions as the court may determine. After considering the additional evidence, the local governing body may amend or modify its decision and shall file with the court a transcript of the additional evidence together with its new or modified decision, if any.
      </li>

   Although the transcripts or recordings of hearings held before the city council were not available to the board of county commissioners before it ruled on property tax exemption requests, a remand under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t28c28-34s28-34-01" target="_self">28-34-01</a></cite>(3) was not necessary because the district court reasonably found that the transcripts or recordings did not constitute material evidence.

   District court did not err in refusing to take additional evidence because the evidence was not “material evidence” or sufficient to reverse the board of county commissioner’s decision to deny the property owner’s application for a zoning change and a preliminary plat approval and institute a six-month appearance prohibition. Dahm v. Stark County Bd. of County Comm'rs, 2013 ND 241, 841 N.W.2d 416, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 237</cite> (N.D. 2013).

   District court properly dismissed a landowner's appeal from a county water resource district decision amending approval of an application for a subsurface drain because the landowner failed to file a timely appeal from the resource district decision; the terms of the statutes conferring appellate jurisdiction controlled whether the time for appeal could be tolled, and nothing in the plain language of the statute tolled the time for appeal.

   District court erred in affirming a county board of commissioners’ denial of the taxpayers’ requests for an abatement of property taxes for the year 2016 because the district court did not have jurisdiction over the appeals inasmuch as the taxpayers failed to timely serve a notice of appeal on the state tax commissioner.

   In a case where injunctive relief was sought after the closing of a housing facility, there was no likelihood of success on the merits because argument that the decision was not rational addressed the wisdom and propriety of the legislative decision, and it was not shown why an appeal to the district court was not an adequate legal remedy to resolve this claim.

   Board of Commissioners' decision denying the company's application for a special use permit was not arbitrary or capricious; a special use permit for the placement of a digital billboard at a distance less than 300 feet from a residential zone had to meet three requirements, and the Board determined the findings supported a conclusion that granting the special use permit would adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of Bismarck's citizens, which supported the Board's decision.

   The scope of review of an appeal from a local governing body is limited to determining if the governing body’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. Pic v. City of Grafton, 1998 ND 202, 586 N.W.2d 159, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 1998).

   In considering a township’s ordinance that prohibited the planting of trees 120 feet from the centerline of a road, the supreme court’s scope of review of the township’s zoning commission’s decision was limited; the decision had to be affirmed unless the local body acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably, or there was not substantial evidence supporting the decision. In this case, township acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably in determining plaintiff tree farmers were in violation of the zoning ordinance because they had a tree farm which was specifically exempted by the zoning ordinances and the township did not correctly construe its ordinances.

   Application of N.D. R. Civ. P. 60(b) to a county’s tax abatement and refund decisions did not create a procedural conflict or inconsistent relief where the taxpayer was seeking relief from a dismissal ordered for violation of procedure during the appeal before the district court, which did not require the district court to shift from its appellate role to that of a trier of fact.

   City council’s determination that the repairs needed on plaintiff’s house exceeded fifty per cent of the house’s value and council’s subsequent decision to demolish the house pursuant to city ordinance were not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable.
