   A creditor who receives a preference by way of a transfer of property is protected only if he receives it for his own benefit, and if he receives it with intent to shield the debtor from other creditors the transfer is void as to them no matter what the consideration.

   A statute permitting a debtor to pay or secure one creditor in preference to another applies alike to corporations and individuals. Baird v. First Nat'l Bank, 55 N.D. 856, 215 N.W. 810, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 1927).

   The term “debtor” includes corporations, general partnerships, and individuals, and gives to corporations, equally with individuals and general partnerships, the general right to prefer one creditor above another. John Miller Co. v. Harvey Mercantile Co., 38 N.D. 531, 165 N.W. 558, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 1917).

   In the absence of fraud a debtor may prefer one creditor over another. Red River Valley Nat'l Bank v. Star Boot &amp; Shoe Co., 8 N.D. 432, 79 N.W. 880 (N.D. 1899); Salemonson v.

   An insolvent or failing corporation may give a mortgage to a creditor to secure an existing indebtedness, even though it constitutes a preference. Farmers' State Bank v. Brown, 52 N.D. 806, 204 N.W. 673, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1925).

      When a creditor is entitled to resort to each of several funds for the satisfaction of the creditor’s claim and another person has an interest in, or is entitled as a creditor to resort to, some but not all of them, the latter may require the former to seek satisfaction from those funds to which the latter has no such claim so far as it can be done without impairing the right of the former to complete satisfaction and without doing injustice to third persons. This section does not apply to execution sales of real estate mortgage foreclosures.

   Where a person holds a first lien on property on which another holds a second lien, and he also has a lien on other property on which there is no other lien, it is his duty, as soon as he learns of the second lien, to respect the rights of the holder thereof to have the property on which the second lienholder has no lien first applied in extinguishment of the first lien.

   The debtor’s right to designate the sequence of sale of parcels does not invariably override and defeat a junior lienholder’s right to invoke equitable principles of marshaling. The trial court should balance the competing equities of the junior lienholder and of the debtor in settling the sequence of sale of parcels.

       <p>
        Where a creditor held a first mortgage on debtor’s surface and mineral rights, this section and N.D.C.C. § 35-01-05 required the creditor, upon default, to proceed against the mineral rights to satisfy its claim because the value of the mineral rights was sufficient to satisfy the debt. This put a second creditor who held a second mortgage on the surface rights in essentially a first mortgage position against the surface rights. In re Hansen, 77 B.R. 722, 1987 Bankr.

Armstrong, 54 N.D. 35, 208 N.W. 847, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1926); Hunt v. Holmes, 64 N.D. 389, 252 N.W. 376, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   On a motion to discharge an attachment, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing fraudulent intent in the disposition of the goods as alleged. Gamble-Robinson Minot Co. v. Mauratis, 55 N.D. 616, 214 N.W. 913, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1927).

   The vital fact rendering a transfer of personal property by a bankrupt void is fraudulent intent, and the burden of proving such intent falls on the trustee in bankruptcy. Murie v. Hartzell, 58 N.D. 200, 225 N.W. 310, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1929).

   A creditor, attacking a mortgage executed by an insolvent debtor, has the burden of proving fraudulent intent. Tomlinson v. Farmers' Merchants' Bank, 58 N.D. 217, 225 N.W. 315, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 1929).

   Where the evidence of fraudulent intent is contained in a written instrument, the court cannot avoid the responsibility of declaring its legal effect. Bergman v. Jones, 10 N.D. 520, 88 N.W. 284, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1901).

       <p>

   The question of intent is always one of fact. It must be alleged, proved, and found in order to avoid the transfer. Stevens v. Meyers, 14 N.D. 398, 104 N.W. 529, 1905 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   A transfer cannot be set aside as fraudulent solely because it was not made for a valuable consideration, but fraudulent intent, actual or constructive, at the time of the transfer, must be shown.

   Company argued that the district court erred in holding the company liable to the county for prompt payment interest, but this was not ordered, and instead, the district court ordered the company to share in satisfying the damages that flowed from its breach of contract; prompt payment interest was a detriment at least partially caused by the company’s failure to honor its contractual commitment, the company was not in a position to complain about mitigation of damages, and the damages findings were not clearly erroneous.

   In a partnership dispute, a trial court erred by determining that a partner was able to avoid an allegedly fraudulent transfer because there was not a valid, presently enforceable debt against the original transferor. Any declaration of the avoidability of the transfer in the event that at some future date one partner became a creditor of another partner amounted to a purely advisory opinion, which could not have been rendered.

   Transfers among family members are more closely scrutinized than arm’s-length transactions between unrelated persons, and once a creditor establishes the absence of “fair consideration”, the defendant bears the burden of proving solvency to overcome a presumption of fraud.

   In a partnership dispute, a trial court erred by determining that a partner was able to avoid an allegedly fraudulent transfer because there was not a valid, presently enforceable debt against the original transferor. Any declaration of the avoidability of the transfer in the event that at some future date one partner became a creditor of another partner amounted to a purely advisory opinion, which could not have been rendered.

   Former N.D.C.C. § 13-02-06 provided that a conveyance is fraudulent if made when the obligor “believes he will incur debts beyond his ability to pay as they mature”; therefore, where evidence showed that divorced husband had conveyed real property granted him in property settlement to himself and second wife as joint tenants, had stopped paying child support several months thereafter, had become ill and unable to work as a result of a heart condition from which he subsequently died, and that cessation of support payments and onset of disease roughly corresponded in time, it supported trial court’s finding of no fraudulent intent in suit by first wife instituted when it was discovered husband’s estate had no assets from which to satisfy support obligation.

        Trustee was not entitled to avoid a transfer under 11 U.S.C.S. § 544 that consisted of the sale of the debtor’s assets because the trustee was unable to meet the burden to show that the sale to the purchaser was a fraudulent transfer under 11 U.S.C.S. § 548 and N.D.C.C. § 13-02.1-04 where the court determined that the purchase price was the fair market value after considering several factors such as the debtor’s precarious financial situation, the condition of the equipment, the small number of potential buyers, the professional opinion of a consultant, the good faith of the parties, and the arm’s length nature of the transactions.

   A creditor who seeks to set aside a transaction for fraud must have a vested and specific lien on the property claimed to have been fraudulently transferred. Bank of Sanborn v. France, 49 N.D. 1, 177 N.W. 375, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1920).

   If a creditor seeks to set aside a transaction as fraudulent, it must appear that the debtor fraudulently made a transfer, and that the transferee cooperated with the debtor in the fraud.

        Advisory Opinion.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   In a partnership dispute, a trial court erred by determining that a partner was able to avoid an allegedly fraudulent transfer because there was not a valid, presently enforceable debt against the original transferor. Any declaration of the avoidability of the transfer in the event that at some future date one partner became a creditor of another partner amounted to a purely advisory opinion, which could not have been rendered.

      <p>
       N.D.C.C. §§ 28-25-14, 13-02.1-07(1), do not require tort plaintiffs to file separate suits in order to set aside alleged fraudulent transfers of property by the individuals or entities sued in the tort suit. North Dakota law does not prohibit a plaintiff from adjudicating both a tort claim and a related fraudulent transfer claim in the same lawsuit, and N.D.R.Civ.P. 8(e)(2) allows plaintiffs to state many separate claims in the same complaint, regardless of whether or not they are based on legal grounds, equitable grounds, or both.
       Rutherford v. Kessel, 560 F.3d 874, 2009 U.S. App. LEXIS 6864 (8th Cir. N.D. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       State court had jurisdiction to set aside the fraudulent transfer of three condominiums by a brother who was sued in a tort action after it rendered a judgment in an assault victim’s favor. Pursuant to N.D.R.Civ.P. 8(e)(2), the victim could assert claims for both legal and equitable relief in his complaint, and N.D.C.C. §§ 28-25-14, 13-02.1-07(1), did not apply to require that the victim bring separate supplemental proceedings in order to adjudicate his fraudulent transfer claim.

      </p>
      <p>

   N.D.C.C. ch. 13-02.1 did not require the court to provide the relief sought by the limited partners’

   post-judgment motion because they did not appear to be proceeding against a specific transfer or obligation under the chapter, but sought to impose personal liability on the president for the final judgment entered against the corporate entities after trial.

       Where bankruptcy debtor paid to the State of North Dakota horse racing wagering taxes of a third party by contract between the debtor and the third party and with the approval of the State, taxes paid prior to the debtor’s bankruptcy petition were not constructively fraudulent transfers since the debtor received reasonably equivalent value for the transfers; the transfers allowed the debtor to continue operating under its State license, the debtor had an identity of interests with the third party and thus benefited from the payment of the third party’s taxes, and the payments reduced the tax liability dollar-for-dollar.

     <p>
      All licenses required herein expire on December thirty-first of each year and may be renewed. Renewals are effective the succeeding January first. Applications for renewal must be submitted thirty days before the expiration of the license and must be accompanied by the required annual fees, which are not subject to refund. The form and content of renewal applications must be determined by the department of financial institutions, and a renewal application may be denied upon the same grounds as would justify denial of an initial application. When a licensee has been delinquent in renewing the licensee’s license, the department may charge an additional fee of fifty dollars for the renewal of such license. A money broker license is not transferable. If the commissioner determines that an ownership change has occurred in a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership, corporation, or limited liability corporation that was previously granted a money broker license, the commissioner may require a new application from the purchaser. The application must be filed within forty-five days from the date change of ownership is consummated. The department shall act on the application within sixty days from the date the application is received but may extend the review period for good cause. The money broker license granted to the previous owner continues in effect to the new purchaser until the application is either granted or denied.

      All licenses required herein expire on December thirty-first of each year and may be renewed. Applications for renewal must be submitted thirty days before the expiration of the license and must be accompanied by the required annual fees, which are not subject to refund. The form and content of renewal applications must be determined by the department of financial institutions and a renewal application may be denied upon the same grounds as would justify denial of an initial application. When a licensee has been delinquent in renewing the licensee’s license, the department may charge an additional fee of fifty dollars for the renewal of the license. A collection agency license is not transferable. If the commissioner determines that an ownership change has occurred in a sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability partnership, corporation, or limited liability corporation that was previously granted a collection agency license, the commissioner may require a new application from the purchaser. The application must be filed within forty-five days from the date change of ownership is consummated. The department shall act on the application within sixty days from the date the application is received but may extend the review period for good cause. The collection agency license granted to the previous owner continues in effect to the new purchaser until the application is either granted or denied.

       Determine the qualifications of all applicants based on financial responsibility, financial condition, business experience, character, and general fitness which must reasonably warrant the belief that the applicant’s business will be conducted lawfully and fairly. In determining whether this qualification is met, and for the purpose of investigating compliance with this chapter, the commissioner may review and consider the relevant business records and capital adequacy of the applicant and the competence, experience, integrity, and financial ability of a person who is a member, partner, director, officer, or twenty-five percent or more shareholder of the applicant.

      <li id="t13c13-05s13-05-06ol12">

The licensee shall pay an examination or visitation fee and must be charged by the department of financial institutions at an hourly rate to be set by the commissioner, sufficient to cover all reasonable expenses of the department associated with the examination or visitation provided for by this section. Fees must be paid to the state treasurer and deposited in the financial institutions regulatory fund.

The reasonable and necessary expenses of the receivership shall constitute the first claim on the bond.

     <p>
      A license issued under this chapter is not transferable or assignable. The prior written approval of the commissioner is required for the continued operation of a deferred presentment service business if a change in control of a licensee occurs. Control in the case of a corporation means direct or indirect ownership; the right to control twenty-five percent or more of the voting shares of the corporation; or the ability of any person to elect a majority of the directors or otherwise affect a change in policy. Control in the case of any other entity means the ability to exchange the principals of the organization, whether active or passive. In the case of a change of control request, the commissioner may require information the commissioner deems necessary to determine whether a new application is required. A licensee shall notify the commissioner fifteen days before any proposed change in the licensee’s business location or name.

The licensee may contract for and collect a returned check or electronic debit charge not to exceed the collection fees and costs authorized in subdivision c of subsection 2 of section 6-08-16. No other fee or charge may be collected as a result of a returned check or electronic debit or as a result of default by the customer in timely payment to the licensee.

       A customer who has authority to make a check or authorize an electronic debit and enters a deferred presentment service agreement is not subject to a criminal penalty relating to the check, electronic debit, or the deferred presentment service agreement unless the customer’s account was closed on the original date of the transaction. At the time of entering a transaction involving a written check, a licensee shall verify that the account on which the check is written is open. A licensee may not pursue or threaten to pursue criminal penalties against a customer for criminal penalties prohibited by this subsection.

       Each licensee must conspicuously post in the licensee’s licensed location a notice of the fees imposed for the deferred presentment service. A licensee that engages in a deferred presentment service transaction via the internet shall require its customers to acknowledge the fees imposed using a click-through or other method that prevents customers from completing the transaction without reviewing the licensee’s fees.

       Except as provided under subsection 13, a licensee may not renew a deferred presentment service transaction more than once. A licensee’s renewal fee may not exceed twenty percent of the amount being renewed. The renewal fee must be paid in cash, money order, or cashier’s check. The total period of deferral, including the initial deferral and one renewal, may not exceed sixty days. An individual renewal period may not be less than fifteen days. After sixty days the renewed deferred presentment service transaction must be paid off in cash, money order, electronic payment, or cashier’s check by the customer or, if a check is used, the check must be deposited by the licensee.

       A licensee may enter a workout agreement with the borrower if the borrower believes financial hardship prevents the borrower from paying off the deferred presentment service transaction at the end of the original agreement or following any renewal. The workout agreement must outline the repayment terms in writing and must require weekly, biweekly, or monthly even installments not to exceed twelve months. An additional interest or fee may not be charged as part of this workout, the deferred presentment service provider shall continue to report the transaction as an outstanding deferred presentment service transaction on any database administered by the commissioner, and entering a workout agreement is voluntary on the part of the deferred presentment service provider and the borrower.

       A licensee may not renew, repay, refinance, or consolidate a deferred presentment service transaction with the proceeds of another deferred presentment service transaction with that licensee by the same maker or customer. It is presumed that a deferred presentment service transaction initiated within three business days before completion of a deferred presentment service transaction is a violation of this subsection.

       A licensee may not conduct another business, other than a bona fide pawnbroking business, within the same office, suite, room, or place of business at which the licensee engages in deferred presentment service transactions unless the commissioner provides written authorization after a determination the other business is not contrary to the best interests of consumers.

      If the commissioner determines an applicant is not qualified to receive a license, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing stating that the application is denied and stating the basis for denial. If the commissioner denies an application, or if the commissioner fails to act on an application within thirty days after the filing of a properly completed application, the applicant may make written demand to the commissioner for a hearing before the commissioner on the question of whether the license should be granted. The hearing must be held within thirty days after receipt of the written demand by the applicant. In the event of a hearing, the commissioner shall reconsider the application and, after hearing, issue a written order granting or denying the application. If an applicant who is denied a license requests a hearing and the commissioner’s denial is upheld, the commissioner may assess the applicant for the commissioner’s costs incurred for the hearing, in an amount not exceeding two thousand dollars.

      <li id="t13c13-09s13-09-04ol11">

       The financial condition and responsibility, financial and business experience, and character and general fitness of the applicant must reasonably warrant the belief that the applicant’s business will be conducted honestly, fairly, and in a manner commanding the confidence and trust of the community. In determining whether this qualification is met and for purposes of investigating compliance with this chapter, the commissioner may review and consider the relevant business records and capital adequacy of the applicant.

      <li id="t13c13-09s13-09-04ol13">
       Every corporate applicant, at the time of filing of an application for a license under this chapter and at all times after a license is issued, must be in good standing in the state of its incorporation.

       Each application must be accompanied by a surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or such other similar security device, hereinafter “security device”, acceptable to the commissioner in the amount of one hundred fifty thousand dollars. The commissioner may increase the amount of the bond or security device to a maximum of five hundred thousand dollars for good cause. The security device must be in a form satisfactory to the commissioner and must run to the state for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to secure the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee with respect to the receipt, handling, transmission, and payment of money in connection with the sale and issuance of payment instruments and transmission of money. In the case of a bond, the aggregate liability of the surety may not exceed the principal sum of the bond. Claimants against the licensee may themselves bring suit directly on the security device or the commissioner may bring suit on behalf of such claimants, either in one action or in successive actions.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c13-09s13-09-05ol12">
       In lieu of a security device or of any portion of the principal thereof, as required by this section, the licensee may deposit with the commissioner, or with banks in this state as the licensee may designate and the commissioner may approve, cash, interest-bearing stocks and bonds, notes, debentures, or other obligations of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or guaranteed by the United States, or of this state, or of a city, county, school district, or instrumentality of this state, or guaranteed by this state, to an aggregate amount, based upon principal amount or market value, whichever is lower, of not less than the amount of the security device or portion thereof. The securities and cash must be deposited as aforesaid and held to secure the same obligations as would the security device, but the depositor is entitled to receive all interest and dividends thereon, with the approval of the commissioner may substitute other securities for those deposited, and must be required so to do on written order of the commissioner made for good cause shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c13-09s13-09-05ol13">
       The security device must remain in effect until cancellation, which may occur only after thirty days’ written notice to the commissioner. Cancellation does not affect any liability incurred or accrued during the period.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c13-09s13-09-05ol14">
       The security device must remain in place for at least five years after the licensee ceases money transmission operations in the state. However, notwithstanding this provision, the commissioner may permit the security device to be reduced or eliminated before that time to the extent that the amount of the licensee’s payment instruments outstanding in this state are reduced. The commissioner may also permit a licensee to substitute a letter of credit or such other form of security device acceptable to the commissioner for the security device in place at the time the licensee ceases money transmission operations in the state.

      All licenses required under this chapter expire on December thirty-first of each year and may be renewed. Renewals are effective the succeeding January first. Applications for renewal must be submitted at least thirty days before the expiration of the license and must be accompanied by the required annual fees, which are not subject to refund.

The application must be filed at least thirty days before the date on which the change of ownership is consummated.
