     <p>
      The polls at all primary, general, and special elections must be opened at nine a.m. or earlier, but not earlier than seven a.m., as designated for any precinct by resolution of the governing body of the city or county in which the precinct is located. The polls must remain open continuously until seven p.m. or a later hour, not later than nine p.m., as may be designated for a precinct by resolution of the governing body of the city or county in which the precinct is located. All electors standing in line to vote at the time the polls are set to close must be allowed to vote, but electors arriving after closing time may not be allowed to vote. A voter may take up to thirty minutes to mark and cast the ballot after receiving the ballot from the election judge. After the polls close, the election board shall generate the report of the vote totals not later than thirty minutes after the last elector in line at the closing time received a ballot. An elector remaining in the polling place after the thirty minutes have expired who has not completed marking the ballot must be offered the choice of casting the ballot as marked or continuing to mark the ballot. If the elector chooses to continue marking the ballot, the ballot selections must be excluded from the report of the vote totals generated by the election board but must be forwarded by the election board to the canvassing board and added to the final tally. The secretary of state shall develop uniform, mandatory procedures for election boards to ensure the secrecy of each elector’s ballot. The election officers present are responsible for determining who arrived in time to vote, and the election officers shall establish appropriate procedures for making that determination. All determinations required to be made pursuant to this section relating to polling hours must be made, and the county auditor notified of the determinations, no later than thirty days before an election.

       As it did in Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, 42 USCS, § 1973aa-1, Congress can prohibit states from disqualifying voters in elections for presidential and vice-presidential electors because they have not met state residency requirements, and can set residency requirements and provide for absentee balloting in presidential and vice-presidential elections. Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 91 S. Ct. 260, 27 L. Ed. 2d 272, 1970 U.S. LEXIS 1 (U.S. 1970).

      <p>
       Durational residency requirements of three months in county and one year in state as conditions precedent to voting are violative of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; unreasonableness of the classification was established by the fact that the registration books in Tennessee were not closed until thirty days before the election which was ample time to complete whatever administrative tasks necessary to ensure the purity of the ballot box. Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274, 1972 U.S. LEXIS 75 (U.S. 1972).

   The place of one’s residence for the purpose of voting is where he has his established home, the place where he is habitually present, and to which, when he departs, he intends to return, must be determined from all the facts and circumstances, and the intention must be accompanied by acts in harmony therewith.

       On claims that elections laws placed an unconstitutional burden on some Native Americans’ right to vote, a state-wide injunction was improper because the residential street address requirement did not require identification that showed an interest in property and furthered North Dakota’s legitimate interests. Even assuming the statute imposed excessively burdensome requirements on some voters, that did not justify invalidation of the requirements on a statewide basis as applied to all voters. Brakebill v. Jaeger, 932 F.3d 671, 2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 22766 (8th Cir. N.D. 2019).

      If a proposed constitutional amendment or other question is to be submitted to the people of the state for popular vote, the secretary of state shall certify the amendment or other question to each county auditor not less than fifty-five days before the election, and each auditor shall cause notice of the question to be included in the notice required by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-13s16.1-13-05" target="_blank">16.1-13-05</a></cite>.

The ballot form must conform to the provisions of section 16.1-06-09 and must be used by all county auditors to prepare ballots for submission to the electorate of each county and to prepare sample ballots. The publication of either the paper ballot or the ballot as it will appear to individuals using a voting system device, whichever corresponds to the method of voting used in the area involved, will satisfy any requirement in this title for a sample ballot to be published. For two consecutive weeks before the sample ballot is published, an analysis of any constitutional amendment, initiated measure, or referred measure, written by the secretary of state after consultation with the attorney general, must be published in columns to enable the electors to become familiar with the effect of the proposed constitutional amendment or initiated or referred measure.

   It is the duty of the secretary of state to certify to the county auditors a joint resolution passed by the legislature, that the question whether a constitutional convention should be held should be submitted to the people. State ex rel. Wineman v. Dahl, 6 N.D. 81, 68 N.W. 418, 1896 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1896).

   Where a petition for a proposed constitutional amendment has been properly and legally signed and prepared as required by the constitution, it is the executive duty of the secretary of state to proceed as required by this section, and he should not be restrained or interfered with in the performance of his duties. State ex rel. Twichell v. Hall, 44 N.D. 459, 171 N.W. 213, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1918).

   This section requires the secretary, upon receiving a petition to initiate or refer a measure, to draft “a short and concise statement which must fairly represent the measure.” That statement is called the “ballot title” which, when approved by the attorney general, must be affixed to the petition. Municipal Servs. Corp. v. Kusler, 490 N.W.2d 700, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>

   Committee chairman’s request to direct the Secretary of State to place the initiated measure on the ballot for the November 2, 2010, general election was denied as the plain language of N.D. Const. art. III required the petitions to contain the sponsors’

   names and addresses, which was consistent with the enabling legislation in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-09" target="_blank">16.1-01-09</a></cite>(2); there was no compliance with the constitutional mandate that the petition, including every circulated petition, contain the sponsors’

   names and addresses.

   Thompson v. Jaeger, 2010 ND 174, 788 N.W.2d 586, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>

   Secretary of State correctly determined the petitions with elector signatures forged by circulators and accompanied by false circulators’

   affidavits could not be used to calculate the number of elector signatures necessary to place the initiative measure on the November 6, 2012, general election ballot and the remaining petitions were insufficient to place the measure on that ballot.

   The secretary is obliged to strike extraneous editorial comment from referral petitions, but not to examine the substance or merit of a proposed initiated measure in approving the petition as to its form.

   The ballot title need not encompass every possible effect of the measure, nor must it convey possible problems that may arise upon implementing the measure. Municipal Servs. Corp. v. Kusler, 490 N.W.2d 700, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>

   In reviewing a ballot title, the court must not concern itself with the merit or lack of merit of the proposed measure, because that determination rests with the electorate. Municipal Servs. Corp. v. Kusler, 490 N.W.2d 700, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   The requirement that each copy of any petition must have attached thereto an affidavit that the signatures are genuine and the signers are qualified electors does not hamper, restrict, or impair the exercise of the rights reserved to the people by N.D. Const., art.III of the state constitution.

   Wood v. Byrne, 60 N.D. 1, 232 N.W. 303, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>

   Subsection (7) of this section, prior to its amendment by S.L. 1997, ch. 188, was held unconstitutional, on the grounds that a statute which shortens the constitutionally prescribed period for submission of petitions hampers, restricts, and impairs the referral powers reserved to the people in Article III of the N.D. Const. Husebye v. Jaeger, 534 N.W.2d 811, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        Abbreviations.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   It is permissible for signers to use commonly understood abbreviations to indicate cities, towns, places of residence or post-office addresses and to indicate dates, places of residence or post-office addresses by ditto marks, but abbreviations and ditto marks must be inserted by the signer himself or by someone at his direction at the time of signing so that the whole proceeding constitutes one act. Dawson v. Meier, 78 N.W.2d 420, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   The statute is intended to regulate and facilitate the circulation of initiative, referendum, or recall petitions so as to aid the secretary of state to pass upon and determine the sufficiency of the petition before filing the same, and must be liberally construed so as to effect its purpose. Wood v. Byrne, 60 N.D. 1, 232 N.W. 303, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1930); Schumacher v. Byrne, 61 N.D. 220, 237 N.W. 741, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1931).
      </p>
      <p>

   The provision that each signer is to add his residence, post-office address, and the date of signing is intended to aid the secretary of state in determining whether the signer possessed the necessary qualifications for petition, and, where the information is given correctly, it is a sufficient compliance with the statute if the information is written by the petitioner himself or by some other person at his direction at the time of signing so that the whole proceedings constitute but one act. Schumacher v. Byrne, 61 N.D. 220, 237 N.W. 741, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1931); Dawson v. Meier, 78 N.W.2d 420, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>

   This section was intended by the legislature to safeguard and facilitate the use of the initiative and referendum for the benefit of the people of the state by discouraging fraud and abuse and minimizing the number of mistakes that might occur in the use of the right. Dawson v. Meier, 78 N.W.2d 420, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   Where date on which certain electors signed petition was subsequent to date of affidavit, such signatures could not be counted; however, where new affidavit was filed and dated subsequent to date on which electors signed petition, such names could be counted as valid signatures.

     <p>
      In enacting this measure, the people of North Dakota:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol11">
       Recognize that, along with the rest of the people of the United States, we have bestowed certain powers on the state and federal governments, and the governmental power flows ultimately from the people, not to them.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol12">
       Do so in the partial exercise of our duty to elect representatives in Congress, under article I, section 2 of the Constitution of the United States, and our duty to elect United States senators, under the seventeenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol13">
       Recognize that the United States Supreme Court has never held that the people of a state do not have the constitutional power to establish term limits for federal legislators from their state.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol14">
       Recognize that certain restrictions are placed on our ability to choose federal legislators, such that we could not, for example, elect a person twenty-eight years old to the senate or require a religious test for a federal legislator.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol15">
       Assert that, aside from the requirements explicitly imposed by the Constitution of the United States, our power with respect to election of federal legislators is plenary.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol16">
       Note that, under the Constitution of the United States, we have certain rights to control suffrage in elections, regulating such matters as residency, ballot access, and voting methods. As the possessors of the power to regulate suffrage, we also have the power to regulate certain qualifications of the agents we appoint by exercising our suffrage.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol17">
       Exercise the legislative power we reserved to ourselves in section 1 of article III of the Constitution of North Dakota.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol18">
       Recognize that, just as the federal Hatch Act [5 U.S.C. 7324 et seq.] restricts the candidacies of otherwise eligible persons from holding elected office, we have the same salutary purpose as does the Hatch Act, namely preventing an incumbent party from using government power to entrench itself permanently into government office.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol19">
       Are mindful of the United States Supreme Court’s statement, in Garcia v. San Antonio Metro Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 551 (1985), that state control of the election process is supposed to be a protection of the state peoples from the national government.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol110">
       Recognize that increased concentration of power in the hands of incumbents has made this state’s electoral system less free, less competitive, and most importantly, less representative.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol111">
       Recognize that our interests are best served by having our United States senators and representatives in Congress be mindful of their origins and return to our ranks whence they came.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol112">
       Make the following declarations and historical findings:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol112a">
         James Madison, in No. 57 of The Federalist Papers, predicted that the house of representatives would always be responsive to the will of the people because that house would be bound by the same laws they impose on the people. President Madison’s prediction was wrong and Congress has arrogated to itself powers not granted to the people, a recent notorious example being the bank of the house of representatives in which members were allowed to kite checks. President Madison’s prediction was wrong in that Congress has oppressed the people with laws from which it exempts itself, recent examples including minimum wage, discrimination, occupational safety, and other laws.
        </li>
        <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol112b">
         The appearance of corruption and the lack of competitiveness for entrenched incumbency seats has lessened voter participation and that is counterproductive to the purposes of a representative republic.
        </li>
        <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol112c">
         Our vital interests in maintaining the integrity of the political process have been harmed by these and other factors. Therefore, term limitation is the best method by which we can ensure that our vital interests are guarded.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-01s16.1-01-14ol113">
       Believe this measure is constitutional and intend it to be so. Therefore, even if a court holds any portion of this measure unconstitutional, thereby substituting its own judgment for that we have expressed in enacting this measure, the legislative council shall require the publisher of the North Dakota Century Code to include the text of this measure, in the manner as if not so held but with appropriate annotation, to stand as a testament to our expressed will, and as a memorial to the defiance of that will by whatever court holds this measure unconstitutional. Furthermore, if any part of this measure is held unconstitutional, we intend that the rest of it be deemed effective, to the maximum extent permitted under section 1-02-20.

      The secretary of state shall establish a uniform state-based administrative complaint procedure to remedy grievances according to section 402 of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 [Pub. L. 107-252; 116 Stat. 1666; 42 U.S.C. 15512]. The complaint procedure must be uniform and nondiscriminatory and address complaints of violations of any provision of title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002, including a violation that has occurred, is occurring, or is about to occur. A complaint filed under the complaint procedure must be in writing and notarized, and be signed and sworn by the individual filing the complaint. The secretary of state may consolidate complaints. At the request of a complainant, the secretary of state shall establish a procedure for providing a review on the record. If the secretary of state determines there is a violation of a provision of title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 [Pub. L. 107-252; 116 Stat. 1666; 42 U.S.C. 15481-15502], the secretary of state shall determine and provide an appropriate remedy. If the secretary of state determines a violation of title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 has not occurred, the secretary of state shall dismiss the complaint and publish the results of the review. The secretary of state shall make a final determination with respect to a complaint within ninety days of the date the complaint is filed with the secretary of state, unless the complainant consents to a longer period of time for the secretary of state to make a determination. If the secretary of state fails to meet the ninety-day deadline for determining a complaint, the complaint must be resolved within sixty days under an alternative dispute resolution procedure.

      A permanent, centralized electronic database of voters, to be known as the central voter file, is established with the offices of the secretary of state and county auditors linked together by a centralized statewide system. The county auditor is chief custodian of the central voter file records in each county. The secretary of state shall maintain the central voter file and provide training and documentation that users who have been granted access to the system shall follow. The central voter file must be accessible by the secretary of state and all county auditors for purposes of preventing and determining voter fraud, making changes and updates, and generating information, including pollbooks, reports, inquiries, forms, and voter lists.

With the exception of a record designated “secured active” and the voter’s birth date and driver’s license or nondriver identification card number issued by the department of transportation, which are exempt records, the precinct pollbooks are open records under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.44.html#t44c44-04s44-04-18" target="_blank">44-04-18</a></cite>. When providing access to or a copy of a pollbook, the election official administering the election shall redact from the pollbook any voter records designated as secured active along with the voter’s date of birth and identification numbers listed on the paper pollbook used in an election. If an electronic pollbook is used, the election official, upon request for a copy of the pollbook, shall generate a list including the allowable information detailed in this section for the individuals who voted in the election. The list provided from an electronic pollbook may be requested by precinct or county. The secretary of state shall prescribe procedures for generating pollbooks and for transporting the pollbooks to the poll clerks for use on election day. Electronic pollbooks may have a secure connection from the polling place to the data maintained in the central voter file to ensure the integrity of the election.

      At each primary, general, and special statewide or legislative district election, and at county elections, each polling place must have an election board in attendance. The election board must consist of an election inspector and at least two election judges. Counties utilizing polling places containing more than one precinct may choose to use one election board to supervise all precincts even if the precincts are within different legislative districts so long as each district chairman of each qualified political party is given the opportunity to have representation on the election board if desired. Appointing part-time election inspectors, judges, and poll clerks is permitted if there is sufficient coverage at each polling place to satisfy the requirements of subsection 4 of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-05s16.1-05-04" target="_blank">16.1-05-04</a></cite>.

      For a local election, the ballots must be printed and distributed under the direction of the auditor or clerk of the local subdivision. For all other elections, ballots must be printed and distributed under the direction of the county auditor, subject to the supervision and approval of the secretary of state as to the legal sufficiency of the form, style, wording, and contents of the ballots. If an auditor or clerk of a local subdivision, a county auditor, or the secretary of state causes or approves the printing of a ballot listing an individual as a candidate when the official knows or should know the individual does not meet the qualifications, or has not satisfied the requirements to be a candidate, the official is guilty of an infraction.

     <p>
      In presidential election years the ballot provided for in section 16.1-06-05 must include the designation of the office of president and vice president as the first listing of the continuous listing of the designation of each office to be voted for. The names of presidential electors, presented in one certificate of nomination, must be arranged in a group enclosed in brackets under the designation of the office of president and vice president on the right side of the ballot column. To the left and opposite the center of each group of electors’ names must be printed in bold type the surname of the presidential candidate represented and in line with such surname must be placed a single oval. A mark within such oval by the voter must be designated as a vote for all the electors. The appropriate party designation must appear, in smaller type, under the surname of the presidential candidate represented.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Constitutional amendments or measures, initiated measures, and referred measures, duly certified to the county auditor by the secretary of state, or any other question or measure to be voted on, except the election of public officers at any primary, general, or special election including officers subject to a recall petition, must, unless otherwise determined by the secretary of state, be stated in full in a legible manner on the ballot. If the secretary of state concludes the amendment or measure is too long to make it practicable to print in full, the secretary of state in consultation with the attorney general shall cause to be printed a concise summary that must fairly represent the substance of the constitutional amendment or initiated or referred measure. After the foregoing statement, the secretary of state shall cause to be printed a statement of the estimated fiscal impact of the constitutional amendment or initiated or referred measure and a concise statement of the effect of an affirmative or negative vote on the constitutional amendment or initiated or referred measure. This explanatory statement must be drafted by the secretary of state in consultation with the attorney general. The words “Yes” and “No” must be printed on the ballot at the close of the statement regarding the effect of an affirmative or negative vote, in separate lines with an oval before each statement in which the voter is to indicate how the voter desires to vote on the question by darkening the oval. If two or more amendments or questions are to be voted on, they must be printed on the same ballot.
     </p>
     <p>
      The measures to be submitted to the electors must be grouped and classified as constitutional measures, initiated statutes, or referred statutes and must be placed within such groups or classifications by the secretary of state in the order received, for the purpose of placing them on the ballot. Measures submitted by the legislative assembly must be placed first on the ballot within their classification in the order approved by the legislative assembly. Constitutional measures shall be placed first on the ballot, initiated statutes second, and referred statutes third. After all the measures have been placed within the appropriate group or classification, all measures must be numbered consecutively, without regard to the various groups or classifications.

       At any time in an election year, any qualified elector may apply to the county auditor, the auditor or clerk of the city, or the business manager of the school district, as the case may be, by personal delivery, facsimile, electronic mail or otherwise, for an official ballot to be voted at that election. A voter may obtain an application form approved by the secretary of state, for an absent voter’s ballot for a general, special, primary, county, city, or school election from the secretary of state, a county or city auditor, a candidate, a political party, or a political committee. The application form must provide the applicant the ability to indicate which elections in the calendar year the applicant wishes to vote by absentee ballot.

      In congressional, state, county, city, or school district elections, if an envelope postmarked or otherwise officially marked by the United States postal service or other mail delivery system before the date of election and containing an absent voter’s ballot is received by the officer after election day, the ballot must be tallied by the canvassing board of the county, the governing body of the city, or the school board of the school district, as the case may be, at the time the returns are canvassed. Any envelope without a postmark or other official marking by the United States postal service or other mail delivery system or with an illegible postmark or other official marking and containing an absentee voter’s ballot must be received by mail by the proper officer prior to the meeting of the canvassing board. An absent voter may personally deliver the absent voter’s ballot to the appropriate officer’s office at any time before five p.m. on the day before the election. Any envelope containing an absent voter’s ballot with a postmark or official date stamp on the day of election or thereafter may not be tallied with the ballots timely submitted for the election. Before forwarding any ballot to a canvassing board pursuant to this section, the officer forwarding the ballot shall print the date of receipt on the envelope. Upon receipt, the canvassing board shall determine that the elector was qualified to vote in that precinct, that the elector did not previously vote in that precinct on the date of the election, and that the signatures on the absentee ballot application and the voter’s affidavit were signed by the same individual before allowing the ballot to be tallied.

      Upon receipt of an envelope containing the absent voter’s ballot, the proper officer immediately shall attach the application of the absent voter and file the ballot with other absentee ballots from the same precinct. If the election official has reason to suspect the signature on the application was made by a different individual than the individual who signed the affidavit on the return ballot envelope, the election official shall attempt to contact the absent voter as soon as practicable to provide an opportunity to validate the signatures. Contact shall first be attempted by phone if the absent voter provided a phone number on the submitted application. If the election official is unable to speak with the absent voter, the election official shall mail a notice informing the absent voter the absentee ballot has been identified as having a signature mismatch and will be rejected if not verified. After submission to the appropriate election officer, a marked absent voter’s ballot may not be returned to the voter for any reason other than to complete any missing information required on the affidavit on the back of the return envelope. Before delivering the absentee ballots to the absentee ballot precinct, the proper officer shall package the ballots in a manner so the ballots are sealed securely. The package must be endorsed with the name of the proper voting precinct, the name and official title of the officer, and the words “This package contains an absent voter’s ballot and must be opened only according to the processing provisions of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-07s16.1-07-12" target="_blank">16.1-07-12</a></cite>.” The officer shall keep the package safely in the officer’s office until the package is delivered by the officer as provided in this chapter.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every candidate for elective office shall sign and file the statement of interests as required by this chapter. In a year when a president and vice president of the United States are to be chosen, presidential and vice presidential candidates shall file with the secretary of state either a statement of interests as required by this chapter or a copy of the personal disclosure statement that is required by the federal election commission. Candidates for elective office who are required to file such statements shall do so with the filing officer for that election at the time of filing a certificate of nomination, a certificate of endorsement, a petition of nomination, or a certificate of write-in candidacy, pursuant to chapter 16.1-11, 16.1-12, or 40-21, as is appropriate. An individual who has filed a statement as the result of candidacy in a primary election need not refile before running in the following general election. A write-in candidate who is not required to file a certificate of write-in candidacy shall file the statement of interests after the candidate’s election at the time of filing the required oath of office. Every individual who is appointed by the governor to a state agency, board, bureau, commission, department, or occupational or professional licensing board shall file a statement of interests as required by this chapter with the secretary of state simultaneously with announcement of the appointment. A filing officer may not include a candidate’s name on the ballot if an error is discovered on the statement and the candidate is unable to or refuses to make the necessary correction before the sixty-fourth day before the election.

        Consequences of Failure to File Signed Statement of Interests.

      <p>

   Candidate was not entitled to reinstatement to the general election ballot because the failure of the candidate’s initial candidate for lieutenant governor to file a signed statement of interests required by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-09s16.1-09-02" target="_blank">16.1-09-02</a></cite> resulted in no lieutenant governor candidate being nominated to the general election ballot, causing the candidate to have no running mate, which is required by N.D. Const. art. V, § 3.

The Act did not allow for a private right of action and, thus, the possibility that the state and local government officials may have violated it regarding a ballot initiative did not allow the organization to obtain injunctive relief against them.

   The legislature did not intend to make a Corrupt Practices Act violation grounds for a civil election contest. District One Republican Comm'n v. District One Democrat Comm'n, 466 N.W.2d 820, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>

   North Dakota Const., art. IV, § 10 is in harmony with interpretation that a Corrupt Practices Act violation is not grounds for an election contest, because that constitutional provision contemplates a conviction of “bribery, perjury or other infamous crime” before a person is ineligible for the legislative assembly.

   Knowingly sponsoring a false statement under the prior corrupt practices act meant that a sponsor must have had a firm belief, unaccompanied by substantial doubt, in the falsity of the statement. Under that standard, a false statement which was negligently made was protected speech. District One Republican Comm'n v. District One Democrat Comm'n, 466 N.W.2d 820, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        North Dakota electioneering ban enacted in 1981, N.D.C.C. § 16.1-10-06 is an unreasonable restraint on constitutionally-protected speech. It is clearly an invalid law based on United States Supreme Court precedent (Mills v. Alabama) from 1966. There is no valid justification for the law in modern day society, nor any compelling state interest offered to support its continued existence.

   A primary election is an election within the meaning of section 121 (present N.D Const., art. II, § 1) of the state constitution which prescribes the qualifications for voters at “any election”. Johnson v. Grand Forks County, 16 N.D. 363, 113 N.W. 1071, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1907).
       </p>
       <p>

   The primary election laws must be reasonable and uniform in their operation and must deal with all parties and candidates with substantial equality. State ex rel. Dorval v. Hamilton, 20 N.D. 592, 129 N.W. 916, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>

   The primary election law is not intended to provide for and regulate the nomination of candidates who do not stand for or represent a political principle or party; it is intended only to regulate party nominations. State ex rel. Hagendorf v. Blaisdell, 20 N.D. 622, 127 N.W. 720, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1910).
       </p>
       <p>

   The primary election laws contemplate party nominations by popular vote of the electors of the several parties entitled to use the election machinery for that purpose. State ex rel. Miller v. Flaherty, 23 N.D. 313, 136 N.W. 76, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>

   Provisions of the primary election law authorize a contest in the district court between aspirants for nomination as a candidate for legislative assembly. Leu v. Montgomery, 31 N.D. 1, 148 N.W. 662, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1914).

   The primary election law should be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial purposes. State ex rel. Miller v. Blaisdell, 34 N.D. 321, 159 N.W. 401, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1910).

   When a candidate sought the removal of other candidates from the general election ballot, alleging the other candidates’

   separate certificates of endorsement violated the mandatory language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-11s16.1-11-06" target="_blank">16.1-11-06</a></cite>(2), the candidate was not entitled to relief because the record submitted to the trial court did not include certain other candidates’

   certificates, so the record did not demonstrate a factual basis for relief.

   District court properly denied a losing candidate's petition for a writ of mandamus because the constitutional and statutory requirements that candidates for governor and lieutenant governor be elected on a joint ballot was met by both the Democratic-NPL and Republican party candidates, the candidate's petition was filed after the results of both the primary and general elections were determined, and he did not provide reasoned argument and authority supporting a violation of his constitutional rights outside of conclusory statements and citations to irrelevant authorities.

These provisions require no-party candidates to have their names placed on the ballot through the petition process and not by partisan nominations through the use of political party certificates of endorsement, and prohibit reference to party affiliation on no-party ballots, nomination petitions, or affidavits. They do not, however, attempt to proscribe the activities of no-party candidates in seeking, or of political parties in providing, resolutions or other forms of support. Haggard v. Meier, 368 N.W.2d 539, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 322</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   Because a political candidate was not a resident of North Dakota for the five years preceding a general election, the candidate was not eligible to hold the Office of Insurance Commissioner of North Dakota. Accordingly, the Secretary of State of North Dakota correctly refused to include the candidate on the general election ballot to fill a vacancy on the ballot. Oversen v.

This ballot contains the number of political parties or principles and a description of where the political parties or principles are to be found in the sections below.

      There must be a separate ballot at all primary elections which must be entitled “no-party primary ballot”. The names of aspirants for nomination to each office must be arranged on the no-party primary ballot in separate groups in their order. The separate ballot may be on the same paper or electronic ballot, but the list of offices and candidates must be entitled “no-party primary ballot” in a manner to indicate clearly the separation of the no-party list of offices and candidates from the party list of offices and candidates. The names of all candidates for any of the offices mentioned in section 16.1-11-08 must be placed on the ballot without party designation. Immediately under the name of each office must be placed the language: “Vote for no more than
      _________ name (or names).” The number inserted must be the number to be elected to the office at the next succeeding general election.

       Arrangement of names on ballots.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Sample ballots used for publication purposes must be arranged using the rotation of the ballot in the precinct in the county which cast the highest total vote for governor at the last general election at which the office of governor was filled. In the event that this determination is no longer possible due to changes in precinct boundaries, the precincts are to be ordered according to the precincts with the greatest voting age population to the least. This information is to be provided by the North Dakota state data center or based on the best available data as determined by the county auditor. On the official ballot used at the election, including electronic voting system ballots, the names of candidates beside or under headings designating each office to be voted for must be alternated in the following manner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t16c16.1-11s16.1-11-27ol11">
       The ballot must first be arranged with all the names for each office on the ballot in an order determined by lot by the county auditor and prepared by the county auditor for all state, district, and county offices. The position of names that require alternating under the provisions of this section must be alternated by an algorithm approved by the secretary of state designed to ensure to the extent possible that each name on the ballot for an office is listed in each position order on an equal number of precinct ballots spread across the county. There must be a different alternation sequence for each of the following, based on the geographical area by which the office is filled:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t16c16.1-11s16.1-11-27ol11a">
         Offices to be filled by the electors of the state, the entire county, or any district which includes the entire county.
        </li>
        <li id="t16c16.1-11s16.1-11-27ol11b">
         Offices to be filled by the electors of districts smaller than the county, with a different rotation for each of those districts.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-11s16.1-11-27ol12">
       Although the names are to be alternated within the offices on the ballot, the name order for an office is to be the same for all ballots within a precinct.

      Any other political organization is entitled to endorse candidates or have candidates petition to be included on the primary ballot in a separate section of the consolidated primary election ballot, if a petition signed by at least seven thousand qualified electors of this state is filed with the secretary of state before four p.m. of the sixty-fourth day before a primary or special election, naming the political organization, stating the platform principles of the party, and requesting the names of its candidates to be included on the state’s primary ballot in a separate section. Political organizations that are granted ballot access under this section are allowed ballot access only for those offices for which the organization has identified candidates. Regardless of the means by which the petition is delivered, the original must be in the possession of the secretary of state before four p.m. on the sixty-fourth day prior to a primary or special election. Candidates of that party are entitled to the same rights and privileges as those of other parties. Petitions circulated according to this section must be filed with the secretary of state in accordance with section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.01.html#t01c1-01s1-01-50" target="_blank">1-01-50</a></cite>.

      A political organization that had printed on the ballot at the last preceding presidential election the names of a set of presidential electors pledged to the election of the party’s candidates for president and vice president or a candidate for governor and those candidates for presidential electors or governor received at least five percent of the total vote cast for presidential electors or the office of governor within this state at that election, and any political organization that has printed on the ballot at the last preceding nonpresidential election a candidate for attorney general or secretary of state, and the candidate received at least five percent of the total vote cast for the office the candidate was seeking at the election are entitled to organize according to the requirements of chapter 16.1-03.

With regard to no-party offices, such a certificate of endorsement has no validity and is of no effect in having a candidate’s name placed on the ballot. Haggard v.

These provisions require no-party candidates to have their names placed on the ballot through the petition process and not by partisan nominations through the use of political party certificates of endorsement, and prohibit reference to party affiliation on no-party ballots, nomination petitions, or affidavits. They do not, however, attempt to proscribe the activities of no-party candidates in seeking, or of political parties in providing, resolutions or other forms of support.

   A candidate for nomination to a no-party office, such as that of state tax commissioner, can have his name placed on the ballot only by the method of filing a petition with the requisite number of signatures, because this section prohibits “partisan nominations” for those offices.

      In case of a tie vote the nominee or nominees must be determined by a drawing of names in the presence of the candidates upon at least five days’ notice to each candidate, by the canvassing board or boards concerned, at a time and place designated by the board. A candidate involved in a tie vote may withdraw the candidate’s name from consideration if the candidate is willing to sign a statement to that effect in the presence of and witnessed by the filing officer of the election. If no candidates remain, the office is to be filled according to the rules of filling an office when a vacancy exists.

     <p>
      Certificates of nomination for nominees for an office to be filled at a general or special election, except for an office appearing on the no-party ballot, may be made as provided by this section. Except for nominees for president of the United States, names of nominees so nominated must appear on the ballot as independent nominations. The names of nominees for president of the United States may appear on the ballot with a designation, not to exceed five words, that names the organization or political party to which the presidential candidate affiliates. The designation may not falsely indicate an affiliation with or the support of any political party organized in accordance with this title or include any substantive word or phrase that is profane or that is already included in or resembles the name of a political party entitled to a separate column under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-11s16.1-11-30" target="_blank">16.1-11-30</a></cite>. Except for candidates for the office of president of the United States, each certificate of nomination by petition must meet the specifications for nominating petitions set forth in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-11s16.1-11-16" target="_blank">16.1-11-16</a></cite>. A political party or organization desiring to submit to the secretary of state the name of a qualified candidate for the office of the president of the United States may begin gathering the signatures for the certificate of nomination on the first day of January of a presidential election year and shall submit the petition to the secretary of state before four p.m. on the sixty-fourth day before the general election. The signatures on the petition must be in the following number:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t16c16.1-12s16.1-12-02ol11">
       Except as provided in subsection 3, if the nomination is for an office to be filled by the qualified electors of the entire state, there must be no fewer than one thousand signatures.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-12s16.1-12-02ol12">
       If the nomination is for an office to be filled by the qualified electors of a district less than the entire state, the number of signatures must be at least two percent of the resident population of the district as determined by the most recent federal decennial census, but in no case may more than three hundred signatures be required.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-12s16.1-12-02ol13">
       If the nomination is for the office of president, there must be no fewer than four thousand signatures and the petition must contain the names of the presidential and vice presidential candidates along with the names of the elector nominees and alternate elector nominees for the office of the North Dakota presidential electors. The elector nominees and alternate elector nominees must be qualified electors of North Dakota.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c16.1-12s16.1-12-02ol14">
       If the petition is for the office of governor or lieutenant governor, it must contain the names and other required information of candidates for both those offices.

   The duties of the secretary of state in certifying the names of nominees to the auditors of the proper county are ministerial and not judicial. State ex rel. Plain v. Falley, 8 N.D. 90, 76 N.W. 996, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 15</cite> (N.D. 1898); State ex rel. Wolfe v. Falley, 9 N.D. 450, 83 N.W. 860, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   When two nominations, purporting to be by the same political party for the same office, were filed with the secretary of state, it was his duty to refuse to certify to the proper county auditors the names contained in both nominations.

   The statute providing that a defeated primary candidate shall not be eligible as a candidate for the same office in the ensuing general election in effect imposes a qualification for the holding of the office of representative in Congress in addition to those fixed by the Constitution of the United States and, insofar as such office is concerned, is inapplicable and without effect.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The inspector or one of the election judges shall deliver ballots to the qualified electors. The inspector or judge delivering the paper ballot shall inform each elector that if the ballot is not initialed by an election official it will be invalidated and to protect the elector’s right to vote the elector should verify that the ballot has been initialed. Before delivering any paper ballot to an elector, the inspector or judge shall initial the ballot. Failure to initial a paper ballot in the proper place does not invalidate the ballot, but a complete failure to initial a paper ballot does invalidate the ballot.

   Although election officials did not make certain that each elector was orally advised of the stamping and initialing requirement, the electors were adequately apprised of the stamping and initialing requirement and each elector had an adequate opportunity to verify whether his or her ballot was an official ballot, properly endorsed, where both sides of each elector’s ballot stated “all ballots other than those used to vote absentee, must be stamped and initialed by appropriate election official in order to be counted.” In addition, voting instructions were posted which stated that a ballot which is not stamped and initialed by an election official would be invalidated and a conspicuous yellow and black poster was also displayed at the polling place informing voters that “STATE LAW SUGGESTS YOU VERIFY YOUR BALLOT HAS BEEN STAMPED AND INITIALED.” Huntley v. Timm, 435 N.W.2d 683, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1989).

   By adding the term “complete” and deleting the phrase “at any place on a ballot” the legislature merely intended to clarify that improper location of the endorsement on the ballot will not invalidate the ballot nor will the ballot be invalidated if there has been a substantial compliance in both stamping and initialing the ballot.

   A reasonable interpretation of this section does not change the endorsement requirement that both the stamp and initials must be affixed to a ballot for it to be valid and countable. Huntley v. Timm, 435 N.W.2d 683, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1989).

       <p>

   The century-old requirement that a ballot, in order to be valid and countable, must be endorsed with both an official stamp and initials, remains as a codified part of North Dakota law under N.D.C.C. §

   section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-15s16.1-15-01" target="_blank">16.1-15-01</a></cite>.

   In amending this section the legislature intended that a failure to either stamp the ballot or to initial the ballot would constitute a “complete failure to stamp and initial” the ballot, thereby invalidating it.

   Statutes of the state have safeguarded the privilege of voting and the purity of elections, not merely by casting duties upon certain officers, but also by affording the voter an opportunity to see and know personally whether or not he is voting a lawful ballot; if he neglects to notice whether the paper delivered to him is a lawful ballot, and deposits an unlawful ballot in the box, he must then accept the consequences of his own acts, and lose his vote.

   Absent-voter ballots that are postmarked prior to the election, but received too late to be forwarded to the proper precinct and are to be counted by the county canvassing board pursuant to former N.D.C.C. § 16-18-14 (present N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-07s16.1-07-09" target="_blank">16.1-07-09</a></cite>), are not subject to the stamping and initialing requirements of this section.

        A ballot must meet in a substantial manner the statutory requirements relating to the form of ballots. Miller v. Norton, 22 N.D. 196, 132 N.W. 1080 (N.D. 1911).
       </p>

   The act requiring authentication of official ballots is mandatory but failure to observe the requirements strictly and literally is not fatal to the validity of the vote. Fuerst v. Semmler, 28 N.D. 411, 149 N.W. 115, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>

   Ballots that are in substantial compliance with the stamping and initialing requirement satisfy such requirement. Morgan v. Hatch, 274 N.W.2d 563, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>

   Despite fact that general election ballots had been stamped with the primary election stamp for that precinct, there was substantial compliance with the stamping requirement, and the ballots were valid where the only difference between the primary and general election stamps was the date, and the ballots were properly initialed and were the proper ballots for the general election.

     <p>
      Upon receipt of a ballot within the provided secrecy sleeve, the elector, without leaving the polling place, shall retire alone to one of the voting booths or compartments to prepare the elector’s ballot by darkening the oval opposite the name of each individual for whom the elector wishes to vote. In the case of a ballot containing a constitutional amendment, an initiated or referred measure, or any other question to be submitted to a vote of the people, the elector shall darken the oval opposite the word or words expressing the elector’s wish. After preparing the ballot, the elector shall place the ballot back in the provided secrecy sleeve so the ballot is concealed and so the initials of the inspector or election judge may be seen. The elector then shall deposit the ballot in the optical scanning device and wait to determine if the ballot is deposited into the ballot box or if the optical scanning device has indicated a possibility for a second-chance voting condition. If a second-chance voting condition is indicated, a voter may spoil and receive up to two additional ballots. The voter’s third ballot must be cast as is and may not be returned to the voter even if errors exist causing certain votes not to be counted.

      The inspector of elections shall provide a sufficient number of voting booths or compartments in the inspector’s polling place, which must be designed to enable the elector to mark, or in the case of ballot marking devices, enter by touchscreen or other data entry device, the elector’s ballot screened from observation. The number of booths or compartments in precincts may not be less than one for each one hundred fifty electors or fraction of one hundred fifty electors in the precincts served by the polling place.

        Ballot Secrecy.

      <p>

   An arrangement of guardrails and booths in violation of statute does not necessarily destroy the secrecy of the ballot. Perry v. Hackney, 11 N.D. 148, 90 N.W. 483, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>

   Failure to provide election booth or compartment for voters did not invalidate election where the voting took place in a room approximately twenty-five feet by sixty-five feet, contained a clerk’s table and a judge’s table for the officials and three large banquet tables and a large desk for voting purposes, all of which provided ample space and accommodations to enable the voters to cast a secret ballot. Mittelstadt v. Bender, 210 N.W.2d 89, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1973).

      The board shall hear the contest and decide all questions of law and fact involved. The burden of proof in each case is on the petitioners.

An individual may not be excused from testifying or from producing papers or documents at the hearing on the grounds the testimony will tend to incriminate the individual, but an individual testifying may not be subject to any suit or prosecution, civil or criminal, for any matter or cause in respect to which the individual is examined or to which the individual’s testimony relates. The board has the same power to compel the attendance of witnesses as the district courts of this state possess, and nothing in this chapter limits the power of the board to make regulations as to the conduct of the proceedings as the board deems proper, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. The board has all powers necessary to the complete performance of the duties and authority conferred upon the board by this chapter.

Fuerst v. Semmler, 28 N.D. 411, 149 N.W. 115, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1914).

      <p>

   The provisions of the statute requiring the authentication of ballots are mandatory but it does not follow that failure strictly and literally to observe its requirements is fatal to the validity of the votes cast. Where a substantial compliance with the statute is made in good faith, the votes should be counted. Fuerst v. Semmler, 28 N.D. 411, 149 N.W. 115, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   Ballots which are not endorsed by the official stamp and initials until after they have been deposited in the ballot box are void. Torkelson v. Byrne, 68 N.D. 13, 276 N.W. 134, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 1937).

   Absent voters’ ballots, not endorsed by the official stamp and initials pursuant to the statute, cannot be counted. Weber v. O'Connell, 55 N.D. 867, 215 N.W. 539, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

   Absent-voter ballots that are postmarked prior to the election but received too late to be forwarded to the proper precinct and are to be counted by the county canvassing board, are not required to be stamped and initialed.

   Vote was properly excluded where voter’s choice was marked by a cross in square at right of candidate’s name in two instances but in a third square, the voter had made a mark similar to an enlarged dot which was blurred as if he had attempted to erase it. Weber v. O'Connell, 55 N.D. 867, 215 N.W. 539, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 1927).

   The statute requiring the stamping of ballots is mandatory and an unstamped ballot is illegal. Miller v. Schallern, 8 N.D. 395, 79 N.W. 865, 1899 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 25</cite> (N.D. 1899); Lorin v. Seitz, 8 N.D. 404, 79 N.W. 869, 1899 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 1899); Howser v.

LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>

   Ballots that are in substantial compliance with the stamping and initialing requirement satisfy such requirement, and are not invalid for minor irregularities. Morgan v. Hatch, 274 N.W.2d 563, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>

   Despite fact that general election ballots had been stamped with the primary election stamp for that precinct, there was substantial compliance with the stamping requirement, and the ballots were valid where the only difference between the primary and general election stamps was the date, and the ballots were properly initialed and were the proper ballots for the election.

       After generating the reports and poll lists provided for in section 16.1-15-06 for delivery to the county auditor, the election board shall wrap all ballots. The ballots and wrappers then must be secured tightly at the outer end to completely envelop and hold the ballots together. Ballots that are void must be secured in a separate wrapper and must be marked “void”. Ballots that are spoiled must be secured separately and marked “spoiled”. In sealing ballots, the various classes of ballots must be kept separate. Each wrapper must be endorsed with the names or numbers of the polling places, the precincts served by the polling places, and the date on which the election was held. The wrappers must be sealed securely in a manner prescribed by the county auditor so the wrappers cannot be opened without an obvious and permanent breaking of the seal. The ballots, together with those found void or spoiled, and the opened envelopes from voted absentee ballots and the unopened envelopes of absentee ballots rejected as defective, must be returned in person to the county recorder. At the meeting of the county canvassing board, the county auditor shall deliver the report of the ballots containing lawful write-in votes from all the precincts within the county if these votes are required to be canvassed according to section 16.1-15-01.1.

Either forty-five days or twenty-two months after the election dependent upon the retention schedule outlined in this section, upon determination by the county recorder that no contest is pending, the ballots must be destroyed. If any contest of the election of any officer voted for at the election or a prosecution under the provisions of this title is pending at the expiration of the time, the ballots may not be destroyed until the contest or prosecution is finally determined. The ballots returned to the county recorder as provided in this section must be received in evidence without introducing further foundation.

      The county canvassing board must be composed of the county recorder, county auditor, chairman of the board of county commissioners, and a representative of each of the two political parties that received the highest number of votes cast for governor at the most recent general election at which a governor was elected. An individual who served on an election board during the election may not serve as a political party representative on the canvassing board for that same election. The district chairmen of the political parties from each legislative district within the county shall appoint the respective political party representative. The county canvassing board must be comprised of at least five members, and both political parties must be represented. Each political party from each legislative district within a county may request representation on the canvassing board if there is equal representation from each of the political parties. For any special county election when the election does not involve any legislative or statewide office, the county canvassing board must be composed of the county recorder, county auditor, and chairman of the board of county commissioners.

If any of the members of the board other than the representatives of the two political parties are disqualified or cannot serve for any other reason, the county commissioners who would be qualified to serve on the board shall appoint alternates to serve in the place of those members of the board who are disqualified. If any of the representatives of the district committees of the two parties are disqualified or cannot serve for any other reason and if the party wishes to have representation, the district chairmen shall appoint an alternate from their respective district committees to act as a member of the county canvassing board.

     <p>
      When the returns of the election board officers are made to the county canvassing board, if any provision of law relative to the duties of the election board officers has not been complied with by the officers and the provision of law is capable of correction by the election board, the county canvassing board may issue subpoenas to the election board officers of the polling place in which the defect occurs. The subpoenas must require the election board officers to appear as soon as possible before the county canvassing board to correct any omission or mistake according to the facts. The amended or corrected returns then must be acted upon by the board. If any election board officer, subpoenaed as provided in this section, neglects or refuses to obey the subpoena, the individual so neglecting or refusing must be arrested upon a bench warrant issued out of the office of the clerk of the district court in the county where the proceedings occur. The individual arrested must be brought before the county canvassing board and shall make the necessary correction. A refusal on the part of an election board officer to make a correction must be deemed a contempt of the district court.

The secretary of state shall fix the date or dates of the recounts of legislative contests to be held within seven days after giving notice to the affected auditors that recounts must be conducted. The secretary of state shall fix the date or dates of the recounts of statewide races to be held within fourteen days after giving notice to the auditors that recounts must be conducted. Within four days after the canvass of votes by the county canvassing board or other political subdivision canvassing board, the county auditor or other political subdivision election official shall fix the date for recounts limited to the county, those cities within the county which combined the election with the county, or other political subdivision. The date must be within eight days after the canvass. In all recount proceedings, the county auditor or other election official, as appropriate, shall send notice of the date, place, and time of the recount to all candidates and petitioners involved by certified mail.

The county auditor shall review all properly cast ballots and associated records. The county auditor shall check the precinct count and the count of the county canvassing board. If the county auditor is a candidate involved in the recount, the county auditor is disqualified from acting thereon, and the county recorder shall perform the duties required of the county auditor by this section. For recounts conducted by political subdivisions other than counties of local offices, measures, and questions, the election officer in a political subdivision shall administer a recount in the same manner as is required under this subsection for counties with respect to political subdivision offices, ballot measures, questions, or bond issues.

If any of the members of the recount board are disqualified or cannot serve for any other reason, the members of the board of county commissioners or other political subdivision governing body who would be qualified to serve on the board shall appoint disinterested qualified electors of the county or other political subdivision to serve as alternates. The recount board shall review all challenged ballots and on majority vote shall decide how those ballots are counted. The decision of the recount board is final, subject to the right to contest the election as provided in this chapter. If during the recount a recess is called, the county auditor or other political subdivision election official shall take appropriate steps to safeguard the ballots.

In a recount limited to the county, city, or other political subdivision, if the corrected abstract shows no change in the outcome of the election, no further action may be taken. If the corrected abstract changes the outcome of the election, the county auditor or other election official shall issue certificates of nomination or election accordingly and shall certify the new result of a question submitted to the qualified electors. In the case of a city election that is combined with a county election, the county auditor shall certify the new results of the election to the city auditor who is responsible for issuing new certificates of election if applicable.

The expenses incurred in a recount of a presidential, congressional, state, judicial district, multicounty district, or legislative election must be paid by the state from the general fund upon approval by the secretary of state of a statement of expenses received from the county auditors. The expenses incurred in a recount demanded under subsection 2 of section 16.1-16-01 must be paid by the secretary of state or county auditor from the bond submitted by the individual requesting the recount.

   Organization could not use an alleged violation of the Corrupt Practices Act, N.D.C.C. § 16.-1-10-01 et seq. (Act), as a means of contesting a civil election under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-16s16.1-16-01" target="_blank">16.1-16-01</a></cite> et seq. The Act did not allow for a private right of action and, thus, the possibility that the state and local government officials may have violated it regarding a ballot initiative did not allow the organization to obtain injunctive relief against them.

   Plain language of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-16s16.1-16-01" target="_blank">16.1-16-01</a></cite>(1)(a) requires an automatic recount when any individual failed to be nominated in a primary election by one percent or less of the highest vote cast for a candidate for the office sought. Although the statutory language for the consolidated primary election ballot for candidates for a political party uses separate sections for each political party, nothing in the plain language of § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.16.1.html#t16c16.1-16s16.1-16-01" target="_blank">16.1-16-01</a></cite>(1)(a) limits automatic recounts to a candidate’s party, especially for candidates seeking to satisfy the minimum threshold of 300 votes to be nominated for the general election. Rather, the plain language of § 16.1-16-01(1)(a) refers only to a candidate for the office sought and not to a candidate of the party for the office sought. Riemers v.

Const. art. IV, § 26 of the state constitution, each house of legislature was final judge on election of its members. District court properly ordered county auditor of precinct involved to hold a special election limited to 526 voters who could be identified and whose ballots were not counted; however, district court did not have authority to order governor to call a special election because governor was not a party to action, and district court’s annulment of certificate of election issued to one of candidates was improper, and because such candidate had been certified as elected and had received a certificate of election and no contest was filed against him, such candidate became a de facto member of house of representatives and was to remain so until election could be completed and all votes, including 526 votes, could be tabulated, with house of representatives, as final judge of election of its members, entitled to take whatever action it deemed appropriate if a contest was filed.

   At common law there was no right to contest a public election in a court because elections were part of the political branch of government and were beyond the control of the judicial branch. An election contest is therefore dependent upon constitutional and statutory authority to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts. District One Republican Comm'n v.

   Corrupt practice was a ground for a contest under former

   16-15-03.

   Contests of nominations under the primary election law had to be initiated within ten days after the canvass of votes was completed, and the affidavit of contest had to set forth the grounds therefor. Olesen v. Hoge, 23 N.D. 648, 137 N.W. 826, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1912).
      </p>
      <p>

   A court is without power to authorize an affidavit or notice containing the ground for the contest of the nomination to be served for the first time after the expiration of the statutory time for contesting the nomination. Soules v. Wolf, 65 N.D. 194, 256 N.W. 757, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>

   Where an election contest is instituted within time, the court may permit an amendment of a defective verification of the notice after expiration of the time for instituting the contest. Hanson v. Walter, 65 N.D. 462, 259 N.W. 762, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>

   Where a candidate failed to file a statement of expenditures incurred at a primary election, it was an act of omission committed at the primary and not at the general election, and, if it was ground for a contest, a proceeding commenced more than forty days after return of the primary election was too late and the court had no jurisdiction. Maher v. Jahnel, 73 N.D. 742, 19 N.W.2d 453, 1945 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1945).

   The requirement that notice of a contest be given in a certain time from the date of the happening of a certain event is mandatory, and compliance therewith is an essential element of the right to maintain the contest proceeding at all.

   The legislature did not intend to make a Corrupt Practices Act violation grounds for a civil election contest. District One Republican Comm'n v. District One Democrat Comm'n, 466 N.W.2d 820, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>

   North Dakota Const., art. IV, § 10 is in harmony with the interpretation that a Corrupt Practices Act violation is not grounds for an election contest, because that constitutional provision contemplates a conviction of “bribery, perjury or other infamous crime” before a person is ineligible for the legislative assembly.

      Election contest actions must be tried as civil actions to the court without a jury.

Election contests must take precedence over regular court business so elections are determined as soon as practicable.
