      Whenever it is desired to form a new county out of one or more of the then existing counties, a petition conforming to the provisions of this chapter shall be presented to the board of county commissioners of each county to be affected by the division. If it appears to such boards of county commissioners that a new county can be constitutionally formed, they shall make the necessary orders to provide for the submission at the next general election of the question of the formation of such new county to the qualified electors of the counties to be affected.

   The electors of a county have the right to vote upon all petitions relating to county division which conform to the statute even though conflicting petitions have been presented for action at the same election. State ex rel. Steel v. Fabrick, 17 N.D. 532, 117 N.W. 860, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1908).

       </h5>
       <p>

   There is doubt as to whether this section applies to a merger and destruction of existing counties, and the creation of a new county consisting of the territory of the counties destroyed. State ex rel. Ulander v. County Comm'rs, 49 N.D. 151, 190 N.W. 549, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 1922).

       </h5>
       <p>

   The question of the creation and division of counties is purely a legislative one, unless regulated by the constitution. The common law has no application thereto. Murray v. Davis, 21 N.D. 64, 128 N.W. 305, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1910).

     <p>
      A county organized under this chapter shall assume and pay a just proportion of the indebtedness of the county from which it is segregated, based upon the last assessed valuation of the original county and in the proportion that the valuation within the segregated portion bears to the aggregate of the valuation within the whole of the original county. The boards of county commissioners of the county organized under this chapter and of the county from which the latter segregates shall meet at the county seat of the original county on the third Monday in the sixth month following the appointment of the county commissioners of the new county by the governor. They shall ascertain, as near as may be, the total outstanding indebtedness of the original county on the first of January or July, as the case may require, next preceding the date of the joint session and from such total, they shall make the following deductions:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c11-03s11-03-11ol11">
       The amount of rents due and payable to the original county.

      <li id="t11c11-03s11-03-11ol12">
       The present value of all public property owned by and remaining within the limits of the original county. Such present value in all events shall be deemed equal at least to the amount of any outstanding bonds issued for the payment of such property.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-03s11-03-11ol13">
       The amount of public funds on hand and belonging to the original county on the day for which its outstanding indebtedness is ascertained which do not belong to the special funds hereinafter mentioned.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The amount remaining after such deductions, for the purpose of the settlement herein provided for, shall be the amount of which the county organized under this chapter shall pay a portion in the proportion hereinbefore specified. The new county shall be charged with the value of county real property within the boundaries thereof. The boards of county commissioners shall ascertain and fix the amount the new county shall assume and pay to the county from which it segregates. The provisions of this section shall be followed even though the new county is organized from parts of two or more organized counties except that the boards of county commissioners of all counties involved shall participate in the proceedings herein described.

A redistricting board may additionally meet during a census interim if a resolution calling for a meeting is passed by the board of county commissioners or a petition calling for a meeting signed by ten percent of the qualified electors of the county as determined by the number of votes cast for governor in the last gubernatorial election is presented to the board of county commissioners. If any one district in the county varies more than ten percent from the average population per commissioner in such county determined by dividing the total population of the county at the last federal decennial census by the number of commissioners’ districts in such county, or if county commissioners are elected at large, the redistricting board shall redistrict the county, as provided in this chapter. If redistricting of a county is required, the chairman of the redistricting board shall, not less than thirty days before the filing of the plan pursuant to section 11-07-03, call a meeting for the purpose of conducting a public hearing to review alternative plans for such redistricting. Notice of such meeting shall be published or caused to be published by the chairman in the official county newspaper at least ten days prior to the date of such hearing.

       Method of redistricting — Election of commissioners at large if redistricting not accomplished by time certain.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The redistricting board shall provide for the election of county commissioners as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c11-07s11-07-03ol11">
       In redistricting a county, the redistricting board shall first attempt to make the districts contiguous following township lines where practicable, as regular and compact in form as practicable, and as substantially equal in population as possible. In no event shall any commissioner’s district vary in population more than ten percent from the average population per commissioner as determined in section 11-07-02, and any variance from the average population shall be justified in the statement filed pursuant to this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-07s11-07-03ol12">
       If the redistricting board determines that redistricting pursuant to subsection 1 is impossible or would create illogical or impracticable districts, the redistricting board shall attempt to make districts of as nearly equal populations as is practicable, but such districts, when created wholly within the boundaries of a city, may coincide with the geographical boundaries of election wards. All of the candidates seeking the office of county commissioner in a county redistricted pursuant to this section must be voted upon by the qualified electors of the entire county, but one of the commissioners to be elected must reside in each of the districts created pursuant to this section. The official ballot must designate the commissioner district of each candidate by having printed thereon the words “of commissioner district” and the designation of that district in close proximity to the candidate’s name. When an individual is seeking nomination as a candidate for the office of county commissioner at a primary election, the two candidates from each of the commissioner districts receiving the highest number of votes are deemed nominated. If only one candidate is seeking nomination from a particular commissioner district, that candidate will be deemed nominated. Following redistricting pursuant to this subsection, the board of county commissioners may combine two or more of the districts so created by resolution passed by a majority of the total membership of the board. In the event that two or more commissioner districts are combined, the number of commissioners elected who must reside in the combined district is equal to the number of districts combined. In the event that a county commissioner changes the place of residence within the county after election from a particular district, the commissioner must be allowed to complete the remainder of that term of office. A candidate elected as county commissioner on a staggered basis as provided in section 11-07-04 must be elected at large, but must reside in the same district the commissioner represented whom the candidate is to succeed in office.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-07s11-07-03ol13">
       In the event that redistricting is required but not completed in the manner prescribed in subsection 1 or 2, all commissioners’ districts in such county shall be abolished and, notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-11-02, thereafter county commissioners for such county shall be elected at large without regard to district representation in the manner and at the time provided in this title and shall continue to be elected at large until a proper redistricting plan is filed as required by this chapter.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The geographical boundaries of new districts created by the redistricting board must be agreed upon by a majority of the board. Redistricting must be completed by the filing, by the chairman of the redistricting board, of an accurate description of the redistricting method employed and the approved geographical boundaries and a statement of the population of the new districts, including an explanation of any variances, with the county auditor by January first of an even-numbered year to be effective for that year’s elections.

       When redistricting is completed or if failure to redistrict requires at large election of commissioners as provided in section 11-07-03, all commissioners then holding office who will be elected in the same manner, either from districts or at large, as they were elected at the last election shall complete the remainder of that term of office. However, an election must be held at the next general election in any district where redistricting places two or more holdover commissioners in that district or leaves a district without a commissioner residing in the district. In those counties retaining the same method of electing county commissioners as that utilized before a decennial, or other, redistricting, elections must continue on a staggered basis in accordance with the same classes in force before the effective date of a redistricting. At the first general election following redistricting of the county or election of commissioners at large, the county commissioner offices held by commissioners whose terms would end in the month of December following that general election must be open for election.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-07s11-07-04ol12">
       If the county previously elected county commissioners at large and the county has been divided into districts, those elected in districts designated by even numbers constitute one class and those elected in districts designated by odd numbers constitute the other class. If election of commissioners at large is necessary and the county previously was districted, classes of such commissioners must be determined by assigning a number to their respective offices according to the numerical total of the votes cast for them at the general election at which they were elected. The commissioners of one class elected in the first election held following a redistricting pursuant to this chapter hold office for two years and those of the other class hold office for four years. The determination of the two classes must be by lot so that one-half of the commissioners, as nearly as practicable, may be elected biennially. An individual mutually agreed upon by the two classes of commissioners shall perform the lot in the presence of all of the newly elected commissioners affected by this subsection within thirty days after the date of the first general election following redistricting or election of commissioners at large, if required, and shall certify in writing the results of such lot to the county auditor within five days after its completion.

     <p>
      If a majority of the votes cast on the question of the adoption of the county consolidated form of government are in favor of that form, it becomes effective on the first day of January next succeeding the election. All elected officers whose offices become appointive under this chapter shall continue in office until their successors are appointed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. The question of the discontinuance of the county consolidated office form of government may be submitted to the electors at the next primary election through the same procedures set forth in this chapter for adopting that form of government. On the first day of January following a vote to discontinue, the county reverts to the form of government of the county immediately preceding adoption of the consolidated office form of government, with all offices made appointive under this chapter subject to election at the last preceding general election, or to another optional form of county government adopted by the electors as provided by law.

      At any time after any form of county managership has been in force in a county for a period of four years, the board of county commissioners may submit, and, when petitioned to do so at least ninety days before a primary election by at least twenty-five percent of the qualified electors of the county as determined by the total number of votes cast for the office of governor at the last general election, shall submit to the electors at a primary election the question of whether or not the county manager plan in force shall be retained. If a majority of the legal votes cast on such question at the primary election shall be against retaining such plan, it shall cease to be operative on the first Monday in January next succeeding the primary election, and the county shall revert to the plan of government in force prior to the adoption of the county managership. Thereafter, the provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable in such county until after another compliance with its terms. When the petition has been filed, candidates for all county offices required under the plan in force prior to the adoption of the county managership may file nominating petitions. If a majority of the legal votes cast on the question are against retaining the county manager plan, the candidates nominated at the primary election shall be voted upon at the general election, and officers shall be elected in accordance with the general election laws. The terms of office of all officers elected as provided in this section shall commence on the first Monday in January next succeeding the primary election.

Notwithstanding any authority granted under this chapter, all property must be assessed in a uniform manner as prescribed by the state board of equalization and the state supervisor of assessments and all taxable property must be taxed by the county at the same rate unless otherwise provided by law. A charter or ordinance or act of a governing body of a home rule county may not supersede any state law that determines what property or acts are subject to, or exempt from, ad valorem taxes. A charter or ordinance or act of the governing body of a home rule county may not supersede section 11-11-55.1 relating to the sixty percent petition requirement for improvements and of section 40-22-18 relating to the barring proceeding for improvement projects.

The invalidity of a portion of a charter or ordinance or act of a governing body of a home rule county because it does not conform to this subsection does not affect the validity of any other portion of the charter or ordinance or act of a governing body of a home rule county or the eligibility for a refund under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-01s57-01-02.1" target="_blank">57-01-02.1</a></cite>.

   Information used to charge defendant with an ordinance violation was in sufficient form and advised defendant of the ordinance violated, and, thus, met the requirements of N.D.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(1) for making a defendant aware of the nature of the offense that defendant committed.

      The board of county commissioners of any county, by ordinance, may impose a county tax, not to exceed two percent, upon the gross receipts of retailers on the leasing or renting of hotel, motel, or other accommodations within the county for periods of fewer than thirty consecutive calendar days or one month. The tax imposed by this section must be in addition to the state sales tax on rental accommodations provided in chapter 57-39.2. A county may not impose a county lodging tax under this section on the gross receipts of retailers located within the boundaries of a city within that county if the city has imposed a city lodging tax, or subsequently enacts and imposes a city lodging tax, under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-57.3s40-57.3-01" target="_blank">40-57.3-01</a></cite>. A county that imposes the tax in this section shall deposit all proceeds in the county visitors’ promotion fund. Moneys deposited in the county visitors’ promotion fund must be spent only as provided in this chapter.

     <p>
      The taxes imposed under this chapter are due and payable at the same time the taxpayer is required to file a return under chapter 57-39.2 and must be collected and administered by the tax commissioner in the manner provided in chapter 57-39.2. The taxpayer shall add the taxes imposed under this chapter to the sales, lease, or rental price and shall collect the tax from the consumer. A retailer may not advertise or hold out or state to the public, or to any consumer, directly or indirectly, that the taxes or any part of the taxes imposed under this chapter are assumed, absorbed, or refunded by the taxpayer. The amount the tax commissioner remits monthly to each county as taxes collected for that county’s visitors’ promotion fund must be reduced by three percent as an administrative fee necessary to defray the cost of collecting the taxes and the expenses incident to collection. The administrative fee must be deposited in the general fund in the state treasury. The tax commissioner shall adopt rules necessary for the administration of this chapter. The penalties and liabilities provided in sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-39.2s57-39.2-18" target="_blank">57-39.2-18</a></cite> and <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-39.2s57-39.2-18" target="_blank">57-39.2-18</a></cite>.1 specifically apply to the filing of returns and administration of the taxes imposed under this chapter. The taxes imposed under this chapter are not taxes subject to chapter 57-39.4. The tax commissioner may offset future distributions of a tax imposed and collected under this chapter if a previous overpayment of the tax was distributed to the county. The tax commissioner, after consulting the appropriate county official, may determine the offset amount and time period for recovery of the overpayment of the tax distribution.

   A deputy sheriff is an employee of the state or county, and not of the sheriff, and his salary is payable out of public funds. Scofield v. Wilcox, 33 N.D. 239, 156 N.W. 918, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 1916).

        Because this section vested the power to determine the number and salaries of sheriff’s deputies in the board of county commissioners rather than the sheriff himself, and because under case law it had been determined that deputies were employees of the county, not of the sheriff personally, such persons were covered by the equal pay provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
        42 USCS § 2000e et seq., and the county, not the sheriff, was liable in damages for sex discrimination in the determination of salaries.

       <p>
        Where a deputy lost an election for sheriff and was terminated by the sheriff, the sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity as to the deputy's First Amendment retaliation claim because, inter alia, the deputy was employed as an agent of the sheriff, a North Dakota sheriff, in the light of pre-existing law, could, and perhaps should, believe that the deputies are “at will employees,” and the sheriff could have reasonably believed that the speech would be at least potentially damaging to and disruptive of the discipline and harmony of and among co-workers.

      The respective boards of county commissioners of two or more counties may by agreement and resolutions of the respective boards of county commissioners employ a joint county director of tax equalization who shall act as county director of tax equalization for each of the counties participating in the agreement. The salary and expense of the joint county director of tax equalization and that of the office and staff must be prorated among the counties participating in accordance with the assessed valuation of the counties concerned or upon any other basis as may be agreed upon by the respective boards of county commissioners. The respective boards of county commissioners, acting jointly, shall appoint the joint county director of tax equalization on the same basis and in the same manner as a county director of tax equalization may be appointed for a single county. The joint county director of tax equalization may be discharged upon the resolution of the board of county commissioners of any county participating in the agreement. Any participating county may withdraw from the joint agreement upon resolution of the board of county commissioners and by giving written notice to the boards of county commissioners of the other participating counties at least ninety days in advance of July first of the year of withdrawal. The joint county director of tax equalization shall have all the powers and duties of the county director of tax equalization of a single county and shall keep all records of assessment for each county entirely separate from the records of other counties served by the joint county director of tax equalization. The governing boards of a county and of any city, or any township, may by agreement and resolutions of the respective boards employ a joint county director of tax equalization and city or township assessor.

        Execution of Warrants.

      <p>

   The signature of the acting chairman of the board of county commissioners is necessary to make a warrant valid. State v. Ryan, 9 N.D. 419, 83 N.W. 865, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1900); State ex rel. Wiles v. Heinrich, 11 N.D. 31, 88 N.W. 734, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1902).
      </p>
      <p>

   Where unliquidated claims against a county are presented to the board of county commissioners and are considered together and allowed at a lump sum less than the amount claimed, if a warrant is drawn for the amount so allowed and accepted by the claimant, the action is presumed to be in full payment of the claims presented.

      The board of county commissioners has power to preserve order when sitting as a board and may punish contempts by fines of not more than five dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail for not more than twenty-four hours. The board may enforce obedience to its orders by attachment or other compulsory process, and when fines are assessed by it, they may be collected before any district judge having jurisdiction, and, within ten days after they are collected, must be paid into the treasury of the county to be added to the state school fund.

   Where a county has moneys on deposit in an insolvent bank, the board of county commissioners may assent to a plan of consolidation and reorganization requiring the leaving of the money in the bank for stated periods on condition that sureties on the depositary bonds shall become parties thereto. Frazier v. Schultz, 54 N.D. 253, 209 N.W. 373, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1926).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Order denying the sheriff's petition for a writ to prohibit the board of county commissioners from taking disciplinary action against a deputy in the sheriff's office was reversed because the sheriff had the authority to discipline employees in his office and the board could not restrict or remove the sheriff's authority to fire an employee hired by the sheriff except through personnel policies that did not usurp or significantly interfere with the sheriff's authority; and there was no provisions in the county's personnel policies and employee handbook granting the board the authority to make disciplinary decisions involving personnel in the sheriff's office; thus, the sheriff, and not the board, had the authority to discipline the deputy. Schwartzenberger v. McKenzie Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs, 2017 ND 211, 901 N.W.2d 64, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 2017).

   The board of county commissioners has the general superintendence of the fiscal affairs of the county. State ex rel. Wiles v. Heinrich, 11 N.D. 31, 88 N.W. 734, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1902).
       </p>

   In the supervision and control of the fiscal affairs of the county it is not the mandatory duty of the board to apply an emergency fund to the payment of warrants drawn on other funds when the same happen to be overdrawn. Boettcher v. McDowall, 43 N.D. 178, 174 N.W. 759, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1919).

        The power to secure additional legal services for the county in important cases rests with the district court, and not with the county commissioners. Storey v. Murphy, 9 N.D. 115, 81 N.W. 23 (N.D. 1899); Fox v. Jones, 13 N.D. 610, 102 N.W. 161 (N.D. 1905).

   A board of county commissioners had no authority to employ a so-called tax ferret on a percentage basis to search out, discover and report for assessment such property as had escaped taxation and aid in the collection of the taxes imposed. Murphy v. Swanson, 50 N.D. 788, 198 N.W. 116, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1924).

        Elected state attorney’s claims for breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and defamation against the county and individual county board commissioners, arising out of alleged retaliation against the attorney for testifying in a lawsuit brought against the county in violation of a settlement agreement, were properly dismissed; although the commissioners had statutory oversight over the attorney, because the attorney’s position was elective, it was virtually impossible for the commissioners to take any adverse employment action against him and furthermore, the alleged actions of the commissioners were not severe enough to constitute retaliation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, or defamation, and actions of an individual commissioner, as opposed to in concert as a board, were not actionable. Myers v. Richland County, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19944 (D.N.D. Sept. 30, 2004), aff'd in part, vacated in part, 429 F.3d 740, 2005 U.S. App. LEXIS 24582 (8th Cir. N.D. 2005).

   Where a county has moneys on deposit in an insolvent bank, the board of county commissioners may assent to a plan of consolidation and reorganization requiring the leaving of the money in the bank for stated periods on condition that the sureties on the depositary bonds shall become parties thereto. Frazier v. Schultz, 54 N.D. 253, 209 N.W. 373, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 1926).

   County commissioners had authority to grant an extension of time of payment of claim against sureties on a depositary bond when, in their judgment, it was to the best interest of the county so to do. Traill County v. Moackrud, 65 N.D. 615, 260 N.W. 821, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1935).

   The board of county commissioners may not under the guise of a compromise surrender valuable rights or interests in claims against solvent and responsible individuals where there is no substantial controversy as to their liability. Traill County v. Moackrud, 65 N.D. 615, 260 N.W. 821, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1935).

   The authority of a county to dispose of its personal property, such as road machinery or equipment, rests solely with the board of county commissioners. McHenry County v. Howe, 64 N.D. 507, 253 N.W. 851, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 1934).

       </p>
       <p>
        The employment of counsel by the board of county commissioners to assist a state’s attorney is ultra vires. Storey v. Murphy, 9 N.D. 115, 81 N.W. 23 (N.D. 1899).

       <p>
        A contract between an attorney and county commissioners to prosecute a suit upon a contingent fee is ultra vires and void. Storey v. Murphy, 9 N.D. 115, 81 N.W. 23 (N.D. 1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        The board of county commissioners has no authority to employ an attorney to collect a judgment owing to the county. Fox v. Jones, 13 N.D. 610, 102 N.W. 161 (N.D. 1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        The board of county commissioners is not authorized to make a contract to collect a judgment or to bring supplementary proceedings or diverse other actions against judgment debtors and others, such power being vested in the district court. Fox v. Jones, 13 N.D. 610, 102 N.W. 161 (N.D. 1905).
       </p>
       <p>

   A board of county commissioners had no authority to employ a so-called tax ferret on a percentage basis to search out, discover and report for assessment such property as had escaped taxation and to aid in the collection of the taxes imposed. Murphy v. Swanson, 50 N.D. 788, 198 N.W. 116, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1924).

   The question of issuing bonds for the erection of a courthouse and jail in one building may be submitted and voted upon as a single question. Hughes v. Horsky, 18 N.D. 474, 122 N.W. 799, 1909 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 48</cite> (N.D. 1909).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Proposal to erect a new courthouse, which called for an extraordinary expenditure of public moneys, should have been submitted to a vote of the people, where sufficient funds were not on hand, nor was any provision made for raising the necessary funds required for the carrying out of such improvement. McKinnon v. Robinson, 24 N.D. 367, 139 N.W. 580, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>

   The courts, in an equitable action, cannot supervise the county commissioners in the exercise of their discretion, or tell them the kind of courthouse that they must erect. McCann v. Carlson, 26 N.D. 191, 144 N.W. 92, 1913 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1913).
       </p>
       <p>

   The selection of one site for a courthouse is not final, and does not exhaust the power of the board of county commissioners vested with the right of choice to choose another before the erection of the building is begun.

   A board of county commissioners does not have general authority to build and repair bridges without advertising for bids. Bayne v. Thorson, 37 N.D. 187, 163 N.W. 822, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 1917).

         Collusion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   Collusion between contractor and board of county commissioners which interfered with or prevented competitive bidding would vitiate the transaction, and the contractor as a party to the fraud would be in no position to recover either upon express or implied contract. Northwestern Sheet &amp; Iron Works v. Sioux County, 76 N.D. 451, 36 N.W.2d 605, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1949).

       <p>

   A contract for repairs to a courthouse must be let to the lowest responsible bidder, and the board of county commissioners must determine such responsibility. Chaffee v. Crowley, 49 N.D. 111, 190 N.W. 308, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 17</cite> (N.D. 1922).

       </h5>
       <p>

   Where each county commissioner signed an order for material for culverts to be used in his commissioner’s district, these orders were not contracts that were binding upon the county and, unexplained, might be subject to an inference of fraud or bad faith. Northwestern Sheet &amp; Iron Works v. Sioux County, 76 N.D. 451, 36 N.W.2d 605, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1949).

       <p>

   The board of county commissioners is not required to secure competitive bids for the printing of primary election supplies. Bismark Tribune Co. v. Johnson, 48 N.D. 1042, 188 N.W. 308, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>

   A mandamus proceeding was improper to compel a board of county commissioners to award contract for printing of election supplies to the other bidder. Bismarck Tribune Co. v. Wolf, 64 N.D. 656, 255 N.W. 569, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1934).

       <p>

   A county is liable for the reasonable value of goods received and used for a lawful purpose where board of county commissioners made a substantial and good faith attempt to comply with this statute, and the purchase of the materials was within the general powers of the board. Northwestern Sheet &amp; Iron Works v. Sioux County, 76 N.D. 451, 36 N.W.2d 605, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>

   Contracts for the sale of goods or material to a county based upon procedures which contain major violations of mandatory statutes providing for competitive bidding are unenforceable in strictly legal actions. Northwestern Sheet &amp; Iron Works v. Sioux County, 76 N.D. 451, 36 N.W.2d 605, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1949).

       <p>

   A reviewing court may not reverse a local governing body’s action simply because it finds some of the material considered more convincing; only when there is such an absence of evidence or reason as to amount to arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable action can a reviewing court reverse, and both the district court and the supreme court are limited to this scope of review. Ulvedal v. Board of County Comm'rs, 434 N.W.2d 707, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   The supreme court’s scope of review under this section is identical to that of the district court, and on appeal it is the court’s function to independently determine the propriety of the board’s decision without according any special deference to the district court’s findings or conclusions in its review of a board’s decision. Riverview Place v. Cass County, 448 N.W.2d 635, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 230</cite> (N.D. 1989) (decided prior to 1989 amendment to this section).

        An appeal from a decision by the board of county commissioners must be tried de novo in the district court. Opening of Gold St. v. Newton, 3 N.W. 329, 2 Dakota 149, 1879 Dakota LEXIS 2 (Dakota 1879).
       </p>
       <p>
        A “de novo” hearing, as applied to judicial review of decision of the board of county commissioners under this section, means a trial to determine whether or not the board acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or unreasonably; this section merely provides the procedure by which the proceeding may be brought before the court. Shaw v. Burleigh County, 286 N.W.2d 792 (N.D. 1979), decided prior to the amendment to this section by Session Laws 1989, ch. 83.

       Additional bond may be required of treasurer.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the county treasurer has furnished a bond by personal sureties or by a surety company, the board of county commissioners may require the treasurer to give an additional bond, or additional sureties if, in the opinion of a majority of the commissioners, the existing security shall have become insufficient. The board may demand and receive from the county treasurer an additional bond, with good and sufficient security, in such sum as it may direct, whenever, in its opinion, more money shall have passed or is about to pass into the hands of the treasurer than is covered by the penalty in the previous bond. The giving of an additional bond or of additional sureties on an existing bond shall not invalidate any previous bond or bonds, nor discharge the sureties from any liability thereon.

   This section authorizes a county sheriff to appoint municipal police officers on a permanent basis to serve anywhere within the county, whenever the sheriff or a regular deputy is unavailable or unable to handle a specific situation.

   The board of commissioners may be authorized by this section to limit the sheriff’s budget for special deputies for a good reason; however, where the record contained no reason for the board’s blanket refusal to allow the sheriff to appoint special deputies, the district court did not err in ordering the board to pay the claims of special deputies for salaries.

       </h5>
       <p>

   The permanent appointment of a municipal police officer as a “special deputy” to act in a “specific or limited situation,” when a sheriff or regular deputy requires assistance, is consonant with the plain, ordinary and commonly understood meaning of the words “special” and “deputy,” and it is compatible with the purpose of the statute to provide aid to the sheriff under appropriate circumstances. State v. Beilke, 489 N.W.2d 589, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-20s40-20-05" target="_blank">40-20-05</a></cite> recognize that a sheriff and his or her few regular deputies cannot always provide adequate law enforcement services in large and sparsely populated rural counties unless municipal police officers, by their appointment as permanent special deputies, are able to assist and provide services to the areas which surround their communities; in such circumstances, a sheriff could reasonably determine that the appointment of a municipal police officer as a permanent special deputy, to serve when the sheriff or regular deputies are unavailable or understaffed, is “required by the conditions.” State v. Beilke, 489 N.W.2d 589, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>

   A special deputy is one who is appointed by the sheriff to exercise special functions for the purpose of either assisting the sheriff or other deputies when they are in need, or acting in their place when they are unavailable.

   In a foreclosure action, the bank’s assignee was properly granted summary judgment because the mortgagors’

   judgment creditor waived its right to the alleged surplus from the sheriff’s sale by subordinating its judgment in an agreement with the bank, the creditor failed to prove that it was fraudulently induced into entering the agreement, the creditor’s constructive fraud claim failed because no qualifying duty existed between the bank and the creditor, and the bank’s agreement not to make a claim for reimbursement against the creditor for the sheriff’s fees and commissions constituted valid consideration for the agreement because a bona fide controversy existed regarding the fees and commissions.

      Except as otherwise provided by law or order of the court, if the sheriff to whom a writ of execution or attachment is delivered neglects or refuses to levy upon or sell any property of the party charged in the writ which is liable to be levied upon or sold, which has been made known to the sheriff by the judgment creditor or the creditor’s attorney, the sheriff is liable to the creditor for all damages sustained by the creditor. The sheriff is not liable if the sheriff has not levied upon or sold property, when the sheriff’s failure to act was the result of following the directions or orders of the creditor or the creditor’s agent or attorney.

       </h5>
       <p>

   Where state sought an advisory opinion on a question of the role and duty of the office of state’s attorney, which was not ripe for review and for which no meaningful relief could be granted, appeal was dismissed; the attorney general, not the supreme court, is the proper legal advisor for state’s attorneys. Bies v. Obregon, 1997 ND 18, 558 N.W.2d 855, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 15</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        It is one of the duties of the state’s attorney to collect a judgment rendered in favor of his county, if such end may be accomplished. Fox v. Jones, 13 N.D. 610, 102 N.W. 161 (N.D. 1905).

   The district court has no power under the statute to appoint an attorney to bring an action for a declaratory judgment in behalf of a county. Ward County v. Jacobson, 69 N.D. 545, 288 N.W. 568, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 1939).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   State’s attorney’s duty to initiate a prosecution does not arise upon the mere submission of a sworn complaint by a person who feels personally aggrieved by an act of another, but only upon state’s attorney’s decision, after due inquiry and consideration, that a criminal charge is proper under circumstances; therefore, where state’s attorney made an inquiry into matter and decided not to prosecute, alleged victim was not entitled to a writ of mandamus to compel state’s attorney to prosecute. Hennebry v. Hoy, 343 N.W.2d 87, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 437</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>

   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for writ of mandamus to compel state’s attorney to prosecute alleged criminal trespassing as state’s attorney made inquiry into the allegation and gave the case full consideration in reaching a decision not to prosecute. The court has long recognized the necessity for the exercise of discretion by the state’s attorney in the charging process, and the exercise of his prosecutorial discretion after due inquiry cannot be controlled by mandamus. Keidel v. Mehrer, 464 N.W.2d 815, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>

   Order denying inmate’s motion for the appointment of a private attorney to prosecute the inmate’s wife and others for adultery and unlawful cohabitation was not appealable, and given the dubious nature of the inmate’s marriage, the reasonable probability of not obtaining a conviction, and the inmate’s failure to report the events to any law enforcement agency, the Supreme Court declined to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to issue a supervisory writ. Olsen v. Koppy, 1999 ND 87, 593 N.W.2d 762, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1999).

         Failure to Institute Criminal Proceedings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   A state’s attorney may be removed from office if he fails to institute criminal proceedings for the arrest of any person charged with or reasonably suspected of committing a public offense. Kittler v. Kelsch, 56 N.D. 227, 216 N.W. 898, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1927).
       </p>
       <p>

   The state’s attorney did not violate his duties when he referred potential criminal actions to the attorney general and settled potential civil actions against individual county commissioners who acted improperly in making donations to a symphony. The state’s attorney’s reasons for not pursuing a civil action were the product of a rational mental process leading to a reasoned determination and supported his discretionary decision not to initiate a civil proceeding against the county commissioners and the state’s attorney’s affidavit indicated he referred any potential criminal prosecution to the attorney general, who found there was not sufficient factual and legal basis to conclude that the actions of the individual county commissioners violated an offense defined by the constitution or statute of this state that would warrant the initiation of criminal proceedings. Thus, the reasons advanced by the state’s attorney supported his discretionary decision not to institute a civil action against the commissioners and his decision to refer any potential criminal prosecution to the attorney general. Saefke v. Stenehjem, 2003 ND 202, 673 N.W.2d 41, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 2003).

   The attorney general and his assistants have the right to appear before a grand jury and to examine witnesses. State ex rel. Miller v. District Court, 19 N.D. 819, 124 N.W. 417, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 1910).

       <p>

   Where a question arises whether a civil action should be instituted, the state’s attorney is required to determine whether a cause of action exists in favor of the state or county, and as to when, how, and against whom to proceed. State ex rel. Ilvedson v. District Court, 70 N.D. 17, 291 N.W. 620, 1940 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1940).

   Order denying inmate’s motion for the appointment of a private attorney to prosecute the inmate’s wife and others for adultery and unlawful cohabitation was not appealable, and given the dubious nature of the inmate’s marriage, the reasonable probability of not obtaining a conviction, and the inmate’s failure to report the events to any law enforcement agency, the Supreme Court declined to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction to issue a supervisory writ to appoint an attorney.

       Criminal act causing death — Felony — Inquiry — State’s attorney may subpoena witnesses.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a state’s attorney is aware of any violation or criminal act causing a death or has reason to believe a felony has been committed, the state’s attorney may, prior to a crime being charged, inquire into the facts of the violation or criminal act, and, with the consent and approval of the district judge of the county, for such purpose the state’s attorney may issue a subpoena for any person who the state’s attorney has reason to believe has any information or knowledge of the violation, to appear at a time and place designated in such subpoena to testify concerning the violation. The subpoena must be directed to the sheriff of the county and must be served and returned to the state’s attorney in the same manner as subpoenas are served and returned in criminal cases. Each witness must be sworn to testify under oath and to make true answer to all questions which may be propounded to the witness by the state’s attorney touching the violation or criminal act. The testimony of every witness must be reduced to writing and must become a part of the coroner’s files in the case of a death and of the state’s attorney’s files in all other cases. For all purposes in this section, the state’s attorney may:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c11-16s11-16-15ol11">
       Administer oaths or affirmations to all witnesses.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-16s11-16-15ol12">
       Apply to the district court for the punishment of any witness for contempt for any disobedience of a subpoena, a refusal to be sworn or to answer as a witness, or a refusal to sign testimony of the witness.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-16s11-16-15ol13">
       Compel the attendance of witnesses under the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure. Any witness compelled to testify under this section is entitled to counsel and all other constitutional rights.

   Instrument that is erroneously indexed under wrong description in tract index does not give constructive notice; prospective purchaser or encumbrancer has no duty, insofar as constructive notice is concerned, to consult reception book or grantor-grantee indexes other than to determine if there are unrecorded and unindexed instruments in hands of register of deeds [now recorder]; consequence of failure to correctly index a mortgage in tract index falls upon mortgagee rather than subsequent purchaser or encumbrancer.

   Where a real estate mortgage was recorded on September 20, 1901, register of deeds [now recorder] was guilty of actionable negligence per se in failing to note such mortgage upon index prior to December 5, 1901. Rising v. Dickinson, 18 N.D. 478, 121 N.W. 616, 1909 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 1909).

   The mere filing of a notice of lis pendens describing the land does not constitute constructive notice to all purchasers where they deal with one who is not named as a party defendant either in the notice or in the complaint. Buxton v. Sargent, 7 N.D. 503, 75 N.W. 811, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1898).

       <p>

   A person cannot be a good faith purchaser or encumbrancer of land when he has notice of facts or circumstances sufficient to put him upon inquiry. Mueller v. Bohn, 41 N.D. 537, 171 N.W. 255, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1919).
       </p>
       <p>

   Prospective purchaser or encumbrancer has no duty, insofar as constructive notice is concerned, to consult reception book or grantor-grantee indexes other than to determine if there are unrecorded and unindexed instruments in hands of register of deeds [now recorder]; he may rely upon tract index. Hanson v. Zoller, 187 N.W.2d 47, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1971).

      Within thirty days of the issuance of any judgment or final decision in a court action or arbitration proceeding which establishes a boundary for real property that deviates from the existing boundaries established by the United States public land surveys, surveys using the North Dakota coordinate system, or any other official survey depicting the boundaries of real property, a plat must be filed in the office of the recorder in the county where the property is located, containing a diagrammatic depiction of the boundary as it existed prior to the judgment or final decision, and as established by the judgment or final decision. The plat must be prepared by a land surveyor registered pursuant to chapter 43-19.1. The plat must be filed in the same manner as provided in section 47-20.1-06 and must clearly indicate that it depicts changes in existing boundaries ordered by the judgment of a court or the final decision of an arbitrator. Specific reference to the property affected must appear prominently in the title of the plat. Liability for the costs and responsibility for filing of the plat must be set by the court or arbitrator issuing the judgment or final decision. The requirements of this section are in addition to any other filing or recordation otherwise required in this state.

The state’s attorney may obtain from the office of the coroner copies of records and other information necessary for further investigation. Except for a report of death and autopsy reports, which may be used and disclosed only as authorized by subsection 4 of section 11-19.1-11, all records of the coroner are the property of the county and are public records.

      The cause of death, the manner of death, and the mode in which the death occurred must be incorporated in the death certificate filed with the registrar of vital statistics of this state. The term “sudden infant death syndrome” may be entered on the death certificate as the principal cause of death only if the child is under the age of one year and the death remains unexplained after a case investigation that includes a complete autopsy of the infant at the state’s expense, examination of the death scene, and a review of the clinical history of the infant.

   While counties with less than 8,000 people are not required to have a physician fill the office of coroner, where such a county had a coroner who was a licensed practicing physician and who also had personal knowledge, as a family physician, of the deceased’s health history, the death certificate which he prepared concerning the death of the deceased, who was found dead in automobile, was admissible and was one of the relevant factors in determining whether deceased died from accidental injuries or coronary thrombosis. Brinkman v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 187 N.W.2d 657, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1971).

   The determination to admit or not admit expert testimony rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal unless the court has abused its discretion. State v. Steinbach, 1998 ND 18, 575 N.W.2d 193, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1998).

   A coroner’s verdict that the cause of death was suicide was not appealable, but could be reviewed by means of a petition for a writ of mandamus, and had it been shown that the verdict was arbitrary or constituted an abuse of discretion, a writ might have issued.

       Duties of county surveyor — Surveys presumptively correct.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The county surveyor shall make all surveys of land within the county which the county surveyor may be called upon to make by the owner of the land or the owner’s representative, or which the county surveyor is directed to make by the district court, by the board of county commissioners, or by the board of township supervisors of any township within the county. The county surveyor also shall make a survey of the public roads and of all lands, tracts, or lots owned by the county when directed to do so by the board of county commissioners. The surveys of the county surveyor or of the county surveyor’s deputies are presumptively correct.

     </h3>
     <p>
      All surveys made by the county surveyor must be made in accordance with the rules and regulations laid down by the commissioner of the United States general land office and in accordance with the following principles, when applicable:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c11-20s11-20-07ol11">
       All corners and boundaries which can be identified by the original field notes or other unquestionable testimony shall be regarded as the original corners and must not be changed while they can be so identified. The surveyor shall not give undue weight to partial and doubtful evidence or to appearances of monuments the recognition of which requires the presumption of marked errors in the original survey, and shall note an exact description of such apparent monuments.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-20s11-20-07ol12">
       Extinct intersection corners must be re-established at proportional distances as recorded in the original field notes from the nearest known points in the original section line, east and west and north and south from such extinct section corners.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-20s11-20-07ol13">
       Any extinct quarter section corner, except on fractional section lines, must be re-established equidistant and in a right line between the section corners, and in all other cases, at proportional distances between the nearest known points in the original lines.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-20s11-20-07ol14">
       Central quarter corners of whole sections, and of fractional sections adjoining the north and west boundaries of townships, must be re-established at the intersection of two right lines connecting their opposite quarter section corners, respectively. County surveyors shall perpetuate the original corners from which they may work by noting new bearing trees when timber is near. They also shall perpetuate the principal corners which they make in like manner.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c11-20s11-20-07ol15">
       In the subdivision of fractional sections bounded on any side by a meandered lake or river or the boundary of a reservation or irregular survey, the subdivision lines running toward and closing upon the same shall be run at courses in all points intermediate and equidistant, as near as may be, between the like section lines established by the original survey.

      Whenever two or more resident owners of real estate desire to have the corners and lines of their lands established, relocated, or perpetuated, they shall give at least ten days’ notice of the time of the proposed survey to all other persons owning lands in the same section, and to all other persons residing in the township owning lands abutting on such section if their lands will be affected by the survey. The county surveyor shall make the required surveys at the time specified in the notice and the expense thereof shall be borne by all the persons benefited to the amount of work done for each as determined by the surveyor. If a person benefited by the survey, whether a resident or not, refuses or neglects to pay that person’s share of the expense within sixty days thereafter, the surveyor shall certify to the county auditor the amount due, the name of the person who is delinquent, a description of that person’s land, and the name of the person to whom the amount is due. The county auditor shall assess such amount against the land of such person and it shall be collected and paid to the county treasurer in the same manner as state and county taxes are collected and paid out by the county treasurer, on the order of the county surveyor.

      If the appropriation for any purpose is not sufficient to meet the expenditures required by law, the county auditor, on the order of the board of county commissioners, may make a transfer to the required fund from any other fund, except from sinking and interest funds set aside to pay the principal or interest on outstanding bond issues, or from funds set aside to retire any other outstanding indebtedness, or from funds received from the state for road, bridge, and highway purposes. The board shall place on its records a statement of all of such transfers, with the reasons therefor in detail, and shall report fully and specifically thereon in the published statements of its proceedings.

      All warrants upon the county treasurer for claims against the county shall be issued by the county auditor upon the authority of properly audited and allowed claims or orders of the board of county commissioners. Approval by the board of county commissioners shall be recorded in the record of its proceedings and this shall be sufficient to indicate approval without requiring a majority of the board to sign or initial the vouchers or orders for payment. Each warrant shall be so drawn that when signed by the treasurer in an appropriate place, it becomes a check on the county depository. No warrant upon the treasurer shall be delivered or mailed to the payee or payee’s agent or representative until such warrant has been signed by the treasurer and entered on the treasurer’s books as a check drawn on a bank depository. Warrants for salaries of county officers and county employees may be drawn by the county auditor from time to time as such salaries become due and payable. The county auditor shall draw all other warrants or orders upon the county treasurer for the payment of moneys upon the authority and for the purposes specifically provided by law. All warrants issued by the county auditor shall be numbered consecutively or in separate series by funds. The number, date, and amount of each warrant and the name of the person to whom payable and the fund upon which drawn shall be stated therein. Warrants shall be signed by the county auditor and at the time they are issued shall be registered by the auditor in a book kept for that purpose.

   County warrants are nonnegotiable instruments and the rule relating to innocent purchasers does not apply. Erskine v. Steele County, 4 N.D. 339, 60 N.W. 1050, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 41</cite> (N.D. 1894).

       County parks and recreation areas funding and county parks and recreation areas capital projects levy by board of county commissioners — Financial report.

     </h3>
     <p>
      At the time of levying county general fund taxes for other county purposes, the board of county commissioners shall consider the budget statement and levy request of the board of county park commissioners and may fund from revenues derived from county general fund levy authority an amount to pay the actual necessary expenses of the county park and recreational areas and activities program of the board of county park commissioners, including repair and operation of the park and recreational areas and their facilities under its control and those recreational activities of benefit to the general populace of the county which are under the control of a city or a city park district within the county. In the year for which the levy in sought, a board of county park commissioners seeking approval of a property tax levy under this chapter must file with the county auditor, at a time and in a format prescribed by the county auditor, a financial report for the preceding calendar year showing the ending balances of each fund held by the board of county park commissioners during that year. The county auditor shall credit the funding authorized by the board of county commissioners to the separate fund of the board of county park commissioners. This levy shall not apply to cities that already have a park levy unless the governing body of the city by resolution consents to the levy.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board of county commissioners shall consider the certificate and budget statement of the board of county park commissioners and may levy taxes annually as provided in <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-15s57-15-06.6" target="_blank">57-15-06.6</a></cite> for county park capital projects and acquiring real estate as a site for public parks and construction and equipping and maintaining structural and mechanical components of parks and recreational facilities. The question of whether the levy for county park capital projects for county parks and recreational facilities is to be discontinued must be submitted to the qualified electors at the next regular election upon petition of twenty-five percent of the qualified electors voting in the last regular county election, if the petition is filed not less than sixty days before the election. A levy may not be discontinued or reduced if it is dedicated to the payment of bonds issued pursuant to subsection 6 of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.21.html#t21c21-03s21-03-07" target="_blank">21-03-07</a></cite>. If the majority of the qualified electors vote to discontinue the levy for county park capital projects for county parks and recreational facilities, it may not again be levied without a majority vote of the qualified electors at a later regular election on the question of relevying the tax, which question may be submitted upon petition as above provided or by decision of the governing board. The levy for county park capital projects for county parks and recreational facilities does not apply to any property located in a city in which park district taxes are levied, unless the governing body of the city in which the property is located consents, by resolution, to the levy.

     <p>
      It is the purpose of sections 11-28-01 through 11-28-11, among other things, to ensure to the people of the state that the bodies of water, parks, and recreational areas created by public agencies in whole or in part with public funds for the use and enjoyment of the public shall not be made the source of private gain through means inconsistent with the best social uses of the same, and to that end the above-named sections shall be liberally construed. The provisions of sections 11-28-01 through 11-28-11 relating to the manner in which these objectives are to be accomplished do not form an inducement for its enactment. The powers herein granted to the board over private lands shall extend only so far as not prohibited by the state or federal constitutions. Should any word, sentence, paragraph, or section hereof be held to be unconstitutional, or should the exercise of any of the powers herein granted be in any particular circumstances in violation of either the state or federal constitution, the remaining provisions would have been enacted even though such provisions had been eliminated, hence invalidity of any part of sections 11-28-01 through 11-28-11 shall not affect the remainder of these sections, but the same shall continue to be in full force and effect as to all other provisions and all other circumstances within the limits of the constitution.

     <p>
      For the purpose of providing police protection and garbage removal services and defraying the cost thereof, any board of county park commissioners may create police protection and garbage removal service districts, and may extend any such district when necessary. The appropriate police protection or garbage removal district shall be created by resolution. The district shall be designated by a name appropriate to the type of service provided for which it is created, and by a number distinguishing it from other service districts. A police protection or garbage removal district may be composed in part or entirely of or include real property which is not otherwise under the jurisdiction of the board of county park commissioners, but which is contiguous to real property under the jurisdiction of the park commissioners and directly benefited by the proposed police protection and garbage removal. The county park commissioners may provide garbage collection services in such district as designated in the resolution, and may designate police officers who shall have police powers for the enforcement of the laws of this state within such district, such police authority to be executed concurrently with other law enforcement officers having jurisdiction over such area.

      The board of county commissioners of any county, at any meeting of the board, by majority vote of all of the members may, upon the petition of ten percent of the individuals who qualify under section 11-28.2-03 as voters of an area to be included within a proposed recreation service district, call for an election of all of the qualified voters of the district to determine the question of the establishment of a recreation service district for the purpose of providing services, which may include police protection, sewer and water, garbage removal services, and public road construction and maintenance, in addition to those provided by the local governing body or agency to summer homes, cottages, and other residences and establishments that exist within the area, and provide for the improvement and control of the environmental quality of the recreation service district. The recreation service district must be limited in size and location to an area contiguous to or within one-quarter mile [402.34 meters] of the recreational waters of the area or to the areas of land which are dedicated to public use for recreational purposes. In addition, the district must consist of not less than forty privately owned seasonal homes or cottages and other residences and establishments. If a petition is presented to the board of county commissioners calling for an election, the petition must be accompanied by any information required by the board of county commissioners, including the boundaries of the proposed recreation district, the approximate number of qualified voters, and a sufficient deposit of money to cover all costs of the election. Within sixty days after the calling of an election, the board of county commissioners shall provide an election on the question of whether a recreation service district should be established and shall establish procedures for voting and other necessary matters not inconsistent with this chapter. The county commissioners shall give at least thirty days’ notice of the election by certified mail to all qualified voters. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question approve of the establishment of a recreation service district, the district must be organized.

      The board of commissioners of a recreation service district may extend the boundaries of the district to property within or contiguous to the one-quarter mile [402.34 meters] limit through the annexation procedures provided in sections <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t11c11-28.2s11-28.2-06" target="_self">11-28.2-06</a></cite> through <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t11c11-28.2s11-28.2-08" target="_self">11-28.2-08</a></cite>.

      Each recreation service district established under this chapter may provide services, which may include police protection, sewer and water, garbage removal services, and public road construction and maintenance, in addition to those provided by the local governing body or other agency to summer homes, cottages, and other residences and establishments that exist within its boundaries, provide for the improvement and control of the environmental quality of the recreation service district, and levy special assessments necessary to provide the services. Any project or service provided by a recreation service district other than under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t11c11-28.2s11-28.2-04.1" target="_self">11-28.2-04.1</a></cite> must first be approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the district affected by the special assessment and present and voting at an annual or special meeting called as provided in this chapter. The levying of special assessments for services and improvement of environmental quality must be levied against those parcels of property benefited in the manner provided by law for the levying of special assessments for municipalities and the costs of police protection may be levied in that manner. A recreation service district may contract with other political subdivisions for joint or cooperative action as provided in chapter 54-40. The board of recreation service district commissioners are responsible for the administration and accounting of any obligations and accounts undertaken in accordance with this chapter. The board of recreation service district commissioners shall serve as the special assessment commission and shall make a complete list of the annual benefits and assessments on each parcel of property within the district. The board shall also hear appeals from aggrieved property owners concerning assessments made and may increase or decrease any assessment if just and necessary. A special assessment may not exceed the benefits determined by the board to the parcel of property assessed. The board may cooperate with the state or federal government in furnishing assurances and meeting local cooperation requirements, within the scope of the power of the board, in connection with any project involving the construction, improvement, operation, maintenance, conservation, or use of the area, including waters, within the recreation service district.

In making any such improvement, in addition to any other powers granted in chapter 21-03, a recreation service district shall, subject to the provisions of this section, be deemed to be a “municipality”, as the term is used in chapters 40-22 through 40-27, for the purpose of creating an improvement district, determining the necessity of making an improvement, contracting for an improvement, levying special assessments and general taxes and imposing service charges to pay the cost of an improvement, issuing temporary, definitive, and refunding warrants to finance an improvement, and levying general taxes to pay any deficiency in moneys available to pay the principal and interest on any warrants so issued. The above language refers to all projects and services costing more than five thousand dollars. Provided, however, with respect to section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.40.html#t40c40-22s40-22-15" target="_blank">40-22-15</a></cite>, if the resolution declaring improvements necessary is required to be published, it shall also be sent by first-class mail to the owners of all property within the improvement district not more than ten days after the first publication of the resolution.

       The board of county commissioners of any county in this state is hereby authorized to erect a memorial or memorials, or other suitable recognition, in commemoration of the people of the county who rendered services, or who lost their lives in the service of their country during a period of service as defined in section 37-01-40. The board may for such purpose use funds out of the general fund of the county if there is sufficient moneys in said fund, or use funds heretofore raised by tax levy for such memorial or memorials. The board may use for memorial purposes funds donated to the county for that purpose, or may use for such purpose funds out of the general fund of such county, if there is sufficient money in said fund, in conjunction with the funds so donated or obtained by such levy and tax, and the proceeds of such levy, tax, and donations, together with the amount taken out of the general fund, shall be used solely for the purpose of erecting such memorial or memorials, or other suitable recognition.

   The legislature met the requirements of the North Dakota constitution when it provided that the taxes levied pursuant to this statute might be levied for the purpose of erecting the memorials or other suitable recognition as therein specified.

   A resolution of the county commissioners, purporting to divide the moneys in a county memorial fund among American Legion Posts in the county, was void as an attempt to vest in organizations other than the board of county commissioners the spending of the money in the fund in derogation of the specific terms of the statute. Hart v. Bye, 76 N.W.2d 139, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1956).

   The legislature intended to limit the power of the board of county commissioners to raise money by special taxation for the memorial fund to the tax levies provided in this statute. Ophaug v. Hildre, 77 N.D. 221, 42 N.W.2d 438, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1950).

       <p>

   A resolution of a board of county commissioners making a tax levy for a memorial fund need be no more specific as to purpose than the statute itself. Hart v. Bye, 76 N.W.2d 139, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 1956).

       <p>

   A building fund raised by bonding the county even if eventually repaid by taxation is a source permitted by the statute to be used in conjunction with the memorial fund as long as each fund is used for the purposes provided by the law for the use of that fund. Ophaug v. Hildre, 77 N.D. 221, 42 N.W.2d 438, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1950).

      Funds provided to be raised in accordance with section 11-32-01 shall be designated as the memorial fund and shall be kept separate and distinct from other moneys by the county treasurer and shall be expended by and under the direction and control of the board of county commissioners.

      On or after January 1, 1960, the board may transfer all unexpended balances in the memorial fund to the county general fund if there is then no existing memorial levy and if such unexpended balance has not been pledged or appropriated for a memorial.

   District court erred in declaring a county zoning ordinance regulating animal feeding operations valid under the repealed version of N.D.C.C. ch. 11-33. The ordinance was invalid to the extent that it regulated more than 2007 amendments to N.D.C.C. ch. 11-33 authorized.

   Trial court properly upheld a county commission’s denial of a property owner’s request to change the zoning of property from agricultural to residential because the commission had satisfied the owner’s request that the record be completed; written findings issued after the owner’s notice of appeal merely summarized the testimony at the commission meetings.

         Animal Feeding Operations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   County exceeded its authority in enacting a zoning ordinance regulating animal feeding operations because the ordinance regulated more than the location of a feeding operation, the type of animals, and size of the operation. State law explicitly limited the county’s authority to regulate animal feeding operations and provided that the county could do no more than regulate the location of the operation, size of operation and type of animal.

         Animal Feeding Operations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   County exceeded its authority in enacting a zoning ordinance regulating animal feeding operations because the ordinance regulated more than the location of a feeding operation, the type of animals, and size of the operation. State law explicitly limited the county’s authority to regulate animal feeding operations and provided that the county could do no more than regulate the location of the operation, size of operation and type of animal.

     <p>
      The board of county commissioners of any county desiring to avail itself of the powers conferred by this chapter shall establish, by resolution, a county planning commission to recommend the boundaries of the various county zoning districts and appropriate regulations and restrictions to be established therein. In counties with three-member boards of county commissioners, the planning commission consists of seven members, of whom at least one must be appointed from the governing body of the city that is the county seat, and of whom at most one may be appointed from the board of county commissioners. In counties with five-member boards of county commissioners the planning commission consists of nine members, of whom at least two must be appointed from the governing body of the city that is the county seat, and of whom at most two may be appointed from the board of county commissioners. The term of an ex officio member is coterminous with the member’s term in the underlying office. The remaining members shall be appointed from the county at large. In counties that elect county commissioners from districts, at least one at large member of the planning commission must be appointed from each district. When appointments to said commission are first made, three members at large shall be appointed for a two-year term and two members at large for a four-year term, after which all subsequent appointments for members at large shall be for a four-year term. Appointments to fill vacancies shall be for the unexpired portion of the term. All appointments to the county planning commission shall be made by the board of county commissioners.

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t11c11-33s11-33-09" target="_self">11-33-09</a></cite> creates a mandatory duty to publish an enacted ordinance before the ordinance becomes effective. However, the immediate publication requirement is not mandatory and only necessitates substantial compliance.

   In a case in which plaintiffs challenged the validity of a county zoning ordinance regulating animal feeding operations, the ordinance was not invalid for failure to strictly comply with the statutory requirement to immediately publish notice of the ordinance in the official county newspaper.

The organization established that at least some of its members were “aggrieved” by the board’s decision and would have had standing to appeal the decision in their own right.

   decision to deny the property owner’s application for a zoning change and a preliminary plat approval and institute a six-month appearance prohibition was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable because there were concerns with density, traffic, and sewer and water issues for residential development of the property and the application was inconsistent with at least four goals of the county’s comprehensive plan.
