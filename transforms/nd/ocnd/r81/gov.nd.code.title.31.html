   The privilege arising from the relation of attorney and client is personal to the client and is waived where he does not assert the privilege. Weisser v. Preszler, 62 N.D. 75, 241 N.W. 505, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1932).

   It is not necessary, in order to render communications to an attorney privileged, that he should require or be paid a regular retainer or should charge or receive any fee for his service. Shong v. Farmers' &amp; Merchants' State Bank, 70 N.W.2d 907, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1955).

   Communications made between attorney and client may be waived by the client’s executor or administrator. Shong v. Farmers' &amp; Merchants' State Bank, 70 N.W.2d 907, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1955).

   Subsection 1 of this section applies to communications between attorney and client with reference to an unexecuted will, even though no actual employment results from such consultation and no retainer is paid.

   Testimony of attorney for decedent regarding the drafting of lost deeds, advice given, and work done with regard to those deeds was admissible where there was no attempt on the part of decedent to keep the transactions confidential, and witnesses other than the attorney and his secretary were not necessary parties to the purpose or objective of the visit to the attorney’s office.

   When a party to an action seeks to exclude evidence on the ground that it is privileged, the burden is on such party to show the evidence is within the terms of the statute. Booren v. McWilliams, 26 N.D. 558, 145 N.W. 410, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1914); Stormon v. Weiss, 65 N.W.2d 475, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1954).

   Communications to a nurse are not privileged unless made when she is acting as a physician’s assistant or agent, but communications of the patient to the nurse necessary to enable the physician to prescribe or act for the patient are privileged.

   The question of the privileged character of the testimony is for the court, taking into consideration all of the circumstances, and, if necessary, the opinion of the physician and the belief of the patient. Booren v. McWilliams, 26 N.D. 558, 145 N.W. 410, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1914).

       <p>

   Where, in a criminal trial, a doctor was called by the prosecution to prove a certain conversation had with defendant and the state’s attorney, the doctor’s testimony was admissible, even though the conversation involved statements that the doctor had previously treated defendant and that defendant had a venereal disease. State v. Werner, 16 N.D. 83, 112 N.W. 60, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1907).
       </p>
       <p>

   The object of the statute is to protect against disclosure by a physician of the condition of a patient, particularly where the patient is afflicted with a disease which might bring reproach and criticism upon the patient if known. Booren v. McWilliams, 26 N.D. 558, 145 N.W. 410, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>

   In a prosecution for rape it was error to receive the testimony of a physician who examined the accused at the request of the sheriff that the accused had a venereal disease. State v. Moore, 52 N.D. 633, 204 N.W. 341, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 1924).
       </p>
       <p>

   A plaintiff, by examining his physician as to the diagnosis and treatment of his injury, waived his privilege, so that defendant might call the physician and examine him as to all relevant matters with respect to plaintiff’s condition at the time of the examination. McDonnell v. Monteith, 59 N.D. 750, 231 N.W. 854, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1930).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where an attending physician is requested by a testator to witness his will, the testator waives the restrictions on the competency of the physician as a witness. Stormon v. Weiss, 65 N.W.2d 475, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1954).
       </p>
       <p>

   In action contesting the validity of a will, the trial court properly permitted the testator’s attending physician to give his opinion concerning the mental capacity of the testator; the objective of the statute securing the privilege is in no way thwarted by permitting those who stand in the place of, or represent, decedents to waive the physician-patient privilege and justice will be more apt to result from such waiver because it will aid in reaching the truth as to the existence of testamentary capacity. Lembke v. Unke, 171 N.W.2d 837, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1969).

   Plaintiff in bringing malpractice action waived doctor-patient privilege and such waiver applied to treatment for the ailment by nondefendant doctors subsequent to treatment by defendant. Sagmiller v. Carlsen, 219 N.W.2d 885, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1974).

   The privilege to withhold the identity of persons who furnished information of violations of law to officers charged with the enforcement of the law is based primarily on the need for the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement. State v. Mertens, 268 N.W.2d 446, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>

   Many citizens will be encouraged to provide information on the commission of crimes to law enforcement officials if they are assured or if there is reasonable certainty that they will remain anonymous. State v. Mertens, 268 N.W.2d 446, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>

   If disclosure of informants were required in every instance, the sources of information on law violations would dry up. State v. Mertens, 268 N.W.2d 446, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>

   No hard-and-fast rule has been fashioned governing disclosure of the informer’s identity. The determination whether a disclosure is or is not justified requires balancing the public interest with the interest of the defendant, which takes into account the totality of the particular circumstances of each case and particularly such matters as the crime charged, the probable defenses, the possible significance of the informant’s testimony, and other relevant factors. State v. Mertens, 268 N.W.2d 446, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>

   If the disclosure of the informer’s identity or the substance of his communication will be relevant or helpful to the defendant in his defense or is essential to a fair determination of the charge, the privilege to withhold the identity of persons who furnished information of violations of law to officers charged with the enforcement of the law must give way. State v. Mertens, 268 N.W.2d 446, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1978).

   District court did not abuse its discretion in requiring newspaper photographer to disclose his photographs, including those unpublished in the newspaper, of an automobile accident scene on the public streets to a party involved in civil lawsuits arising from the accident where: the lawsuits were not frivolous; the photographs were the only ones made of the accident scene and the party made an adequate showing that she exhausted other available means of securing the information sought; the information sought involved the point of impact of the accident, which was in issue in the lawsuits, and the photographs may have contained unique evidence involving such issue; requiring disclosure would not violate any confidentiality of the newspaper or persons appearing in the photographs; and, under the facts of the case, disclosure would not have a chilling effect on First Amendment rights.

     <p>
      No person may be compelled to be a witness against himself or herself in a criminal action. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, in any criminal proceedings before a court or grand jury or state’s attorney’s inquiry, if a person refuses to answer a question or produce evidence of any kind on the ground that the person may be incriminated thereby, and if the prosecuting attorney, in writing and with approval of the attorney general, requests the court to order that person to answer the question or produce the evidence, the court after notice to the witness and hearing may so order, and that person shall comply with the order. In the case of a state’s attorney’s inquiry, such application must be made to the district court. No testimony or other information compelled under the order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from the testimony, may be used against the witness in any criminal proceeding, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or contempt committed in answering, or failing to answer, or in producing, or failing to produce, evidence in accordance with the order.

   The direction that “application must be made to the district court” does not displace the prior direction in this section for the attorney general’s approval, but specifies that a request for immunity in a state’s attorney’s inquiry must be made to the district court that authorized the inquiry, rather than to another court.

   When the state does not grant immunity to a defense witness, it does not violate the defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights. State v. Schroeder, 485 N.W.2d 795, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1992).

   Neither the Sixth Amendment to the federal constitution nor article I, section 12 of the state constitution requires the state to grant immunity to defense witnesses in a criminal prosecution. State v. Dachtler, 318 N.W.2d 769, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   Prosecutor’s refusal to grant immunity to defense witness or to drop the charges against her did not violate defendant’s right to a fair trial or to call witnesses on his own behalf where the prosecutor made no attempt to interfere with or discourage the witness from testifying; neither the sixth amendment of the federal constitution nor article I, section 12 of the state constitution requires the state to grant immunity to defense witnesses.

   Miranda warnings are not required to be given to drunken driving suspects before administering field sobriety tests consisting of having the suspect walk heel to toe on a line, putting his finger to his nose, standing on one leg, and having his eyes observed after shining a flashlight in them; such tests are physical and real evidence and do not activate the protections, including the right against self-incrimination, afforded by the fifth amendment.

   The district court could not properly grant a prosecutor’s application for immunity without the attorney general’s approval, and because it did not grant sufficient immunity, the court exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering witnesses to incriminate themselves.

   In a case involving assault and drug offenses, defendant was unable to challenge a decision to grant a witness use immunity because the ability to challenge a grant of immunity is personal, like the ability to assert the privilege against self-incrimination, and therefore a defendant does not have standing to challenge a grant of immunity to another person.

       <p>

   The intent of the legislature in using the words “for each day’s attendance” in this section prior to its amendment seems to have been to allow witness fees to be taxed only for days of attendance at trial, while testifying, waiting to testify, or waiting to give rebuttal testimony. United Dev. Corp. v. State Highway Dep't, 133 N.W.2d 439, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 1965).

       <p>

   Allowance of disbursements under the statutes lies within the discretion of the trial court, which is in a better position to determine the reasonableness and necessity of the disbursements sought by the prevailing party, and the trial court’s decision will be overturned only if an abuse of discretion is shown.

   The right to have witness fees taxed does not depend on whether the witness was served with a subpoena, and fees for witnesses who attend voluntarily and testify without compulsion are entitled to be taxed as costs.

   Where witnesses have been subpoenaed in good faith and attend at the trial, a dismissal at the close of plaintiff’s case, making it unnecessary for the defendant to call the witnesses, does not deprive him of taxing as costs the allowance for their fees and mileage.

     </ol>
     <p>
      the court, if the attendance of the witness is upon a trial, by order upon its minutes, or in any other case, the judge, by a written order, may direct the state in district court cases or the city in municipal court cases to pay the witness a reasonable sum to be specified in the order for the necessary expenses of the witness’s attendance. Upon the production of the order or a certified copy thereof, the state or city, to whichever entity the order is directed, must pay the witness the sum specified. In district court cases, the attorney general shall pay prosecution witness expenses and the supreme court shall pay other witness expenses.

   Indigent defendant’s argument that he was not provided adequate financial resources to retain necessary experts for an effective defense was not preserved for appeal, and the court did not find obvious error, pursuant to N.D.R.Crim.P. 52(b), because the defendant’s experts were not disproportionately outnumbered by the State’s experts.

       Attendance of prisoners as witnesses for state in criminal actions — How effected.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When the testimony of a witness for the state is required in a criminal action, before a court of record of this state, and such witness is confined in the penitentiary or in a county jail, an order for the witness’s temporary removal from the penitentiary or such jail, and for the witness’s production before such court, may be made by the court in which the action is pending or by the judge authorized by law to preside at the trial of such action. If the penitentiary or such jail is not located in the county in which the application is made, such order shall be made only upon the affidavit of the state’s attorney or some other person on behalf of the state showing that the testimony is material and necessary, and even then the granting of the order shall be in the discretion of the court or such judge. The order must be executed by the sheriff of the county in which it is made by delivering to the warden or jailer having such witness in charge a copy of such order, and the warden or jailer shall deliver the person so required to such officer and shall take such officer’s receipt for the person endorsed upon the copy of such order. The officer receiving any such person shall take the person before the proper court, shall keep the person safely, and when the person is required no longer as a witness, shall return the person to the custody from which the person was received. Neither the warden nor the jailer shall be responsible for any such person until the person’s return, and upon the return of any such person the warden or jailer, as the case may be, shall endorse the warden’s or jailer’s receipt upon the original order. The sheriff executing any such order shall return the same to the clerk of the district court of the county from which it was issued, and said clerk shall file and preserve the same among the papers in the action. The expense of executing such order shall be paid by the county in which the order shall be made.

     <ol>
      <li id="t31c31-03s31-03-19ol11">

      If any such material witness is a minor, any adult person may be allowed to give an undertaking for the minor’s appearance, or the magistrate may take the undertaking of such minor in a sum not exceeding fifty dollars, which shall be valid and binding in law, notwithstanding the disability of minority.

       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t31c31-04s31-04-04.1ol11a">

         All questioning must be done by the prosecutor or counsel for the defendant unless the defendant is an attorney pro se. An attorney pro se must conduct all questioning from outside the presence of the child. Upon request of any of the parties or upon the determination of the court that it would be appropriate, the court may appoint a person who is qualified as an expert and who has dealt with the child in a therapeutic setting to aid the court throughout proceedings conducted under this section and the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to protect the interests of the child.

       A child victim’s videotaped statement is admissible pursuant to subsection 1 if the court finds that the child is unavailable as a witness to testify at trial and, upon viewing the videotape recording before it is shown to the jury, determines that it is sufficiently reliable and trustworthy and that the interests of justice will best be served by admission of the statement into evidence. For purposes of this subsection, “unavailable” includes a determination, based on medical or psychological evidence or expert testimony, that the child would suffer serious emotional or psychological strain if required to testify at trial. The court, in making its findings and determinations under this subsection, shall consider at least the following:

       <p>

   Hospital records are admissible as “business” records; although hospital records are admissible generally, individual entries therein are subject to scrutiny and may be excluded or eliminated from such records on the basis that the entries are otherwise not admissible; self-serving statements in a hospital record, if offered to establish how an injury occurred or to establish liability, are not admissible unless the statement is relevant and helpful to or serves as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient’s injury. Jahner v. Jacob, 233 N.W.2d 791, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 870, 96 S. Ct. 134, 46 L. Ed. 2d 100, 1975 U.S. LEXIS 2802 (U.S. 1975).

   Where business invoices showing the amount owed by defendant to plaintiff were missing, plaintiff’s monthly statements, which were prepared from the invoices, were admissible evidence as to the amount owed by defendant to plaintiff where the monthly statements were a part of plaintiff’s regular bookkeeping records and notices of the invoices by number, date, and amount owed were sent to defendant and were included in the monthly statements forwarded to defendant by plaintiff. Sheyenne Valley Lumber Co. v. Nokleberg, 319 N.W.2d 120, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1982).

   Where trial court admitted opinions of three doctors, contained in voluminous hospital records which were admitted into evidence, such opinions were subject to scrutiny and could be eliminated from records on basis that they were not otherwise admissible, but since trial court is qualified to rule on admissibility of evidence, and case was tried without jury, it was not prejudicial error to admit hospital records.

   Trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to receive, as a part of the business records of the plaintiff’s doctor, a medical report in the form of a letter received from another physician who was dead at the time of the trial; the letter contained findings and conclusions which, if received, would have become a part of the record without affording the defendant an opportunity to cross-examine on the matters in issue.

   Since there is no common law in any case in which law is declared by code, this section prevails over any judicial pronouncements rendered prior to its enactment; where alleged assignor denied having assigned contracts, this section made it mandatory that exhibits bearing signatures which assignor said were not his be admitted for purpose of comparing signatures thereon with genuine signatures also admitted; statute contains no qualification and does not require that expert be first called to determine genuineness of questioned signatures before they be admitted for purposes of comparison.

   The supreme court, on appeal, may take notice of the tables, though they have not been introduced in evidence. Schultz v. Winston &amp; Newell Co., 68 N.D. 674, 283 N.W. 69, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1938).

   Judicial notice is taken of the fact that both the American Experience Table of Mortality and the Commissioner’s 1958 Standard Ordinary Table of Mortality are standard statistical tables of mortality within the definition of this section.

   Statement by the trial court that deceased “had a life expectancy of 30.35 years” is not an accurate statement of the law in regard to this section. Larson v. Meyer, 135 N.W.2d 145 (N.D. 1965), overruled on other grounds, Hopkins v. McBane, 427 N.W.2d 85, 77 A.L.R.4th 391 (N.D. 1988), distinguished, Crosby v.

       <p>

   Where the court instructs the jury that life expectancy tables are of restricted significance, and that the jury should also consider such factors as occupation, health habits, and activity of the person whose life expectancy is in question, and where the age from which life expectancy is computed is slightly less than the actual age of the person in question at the time of the trial, the error is insignificant and is not prejudicial.

   When a beneficiary sought to contest a trust modification, it was an abuse of discretion to enter summary judgment dismissing the beneficiary’s contest on grounds the 120 day contest period expired before suit was filed without giving the beneficiary an opportunity to conduct discovery because the presumption that the beneficiary received notice of the modification proceedings when delivered to the beneficiary’s last known address was rebuttable, as the presumption was not a statutory conclusive presumption, and the 120 day limitation period did not begin until receipt of notice, so the beneficiary was entitled to conduct discovery on why notice was sent to a prior address, especially since the limitation period was relatively short.

   Presumption of subsection 2 that an unlawful act was done with unlawful intent violates the directive of Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S. Ct. 2450, 61 L. Ed. 2d 39 (1979), that a jury instruction that the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary act violates the fourteenth amendment requirement that the state prove any element of a criminal offense by a reasonable doubt, as the jury may interpret it as conclusive and as shifting the burden of proof. State v. Sheldon, 301 N.W.2d 604, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 342</cite> (N.D. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1002, 101 S. Ct. 1711, 68 L. Ed. 2d 204, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 1398 (U.S. 1981).

Ed. 2d 204 (1981) deprived defendant, charged with deliberate homicide, of his right to due process of law, necessitating reversal and retrial. State v.

       <p>

   Jury instruction in criminal prosecution which stated that “It is presumed, however, that an unlawful act was done with an unlawful intent” did not violate the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and was superfluous and surplusage where the crime being prosecuted did not include intent as an element.

        Under subsection 19 of this section the disputable presumption that private transactions have been fair and reasonable is created and where circumstantial evidence is relied upon to show fraud, it is not sufficient that circumstances raise a suspicion of fraud.

   Where there was a question as to the number of electors needed to sign a petition, it was reasonable to assume that there were as many electors in the city at the time of the filing of the petition as there were registered at the last general election.

   Under the Supreme Court of North Dakota's case law, a defendant may present evidence showing nonreceipt of a notice of opportunity for a hearing on a license suspension proceeding or evidence of nonreceipt of the order of suspension, but the State is also entitled to present evidence regarding the credibility of the defendant's claim. The Supreme Court's decisions recognize the issue of receipt is a factual issue for the trier-of-fact and credible evidence of a defendant's actual knowledge of a suspension is sufficient to support a conviction for driving under suspension.

   It was error to reverse the Department of Transportation’s (Department) hearing officer’s decision suspending a driver’s license because a notation in the driver’s driving record kept by the Department was adequate to find the driver’s license was previously suspended within seven years of the driver’s most recent arrest, justifying an enhanced suspension, as the Department’s regularly kept driving records, and specifically notations, only had to be “readily ascertainable” to the Department’s director and designees, and the driver did not rebut the Department’s interpretation of the driver’s driving record.

   Trial court

   was not clearly erroneous when it determined that the presumption

   as it related to the Attorney General was rebutted and, therefore,

   could not act to cancel the allegedly contradicting presumption of

   the county recorder performing her regular duty because the long delay

   in filing suit evidenced the fact that the duty to bring a corporate

   farming enforcement action was not being performed regularly; because

   one presumption had been rebutted, there could be no conflict. Wayne Stenehjem ex rel. State v. Nat'l Audubon Soc., Inc., 2014 ND 71, 844 N.W.2d 892, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 2014).

   Trial court’s

   finding that the State failed to rebut the presumption that the county

   recorder performed her official duty was not clearly erroneous because

   there was evidence to support it, and it was not induced by an erroneous

   view of the law; the trial court applied the presumption, based on

   the facts, that the county recorder’s office performed its

   official duty and submitted a nonprofit conservation organization’s

   deed to the Attorney General. Wayne Stenehjem ex rel. State v. Nat'l Audubon Soc., Inc., 2014 ND 71, 844 N.W.2d 892, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 2014).

   Where a new trial is granted by a judge other than the one who tried the case, the reason for the rule that the order is to be sustained, although the trial court would have been justified in reaching a different conclusion, and although the appellate court might deem a different conclusion the better one, does not exist and the rule itself should not be rigidly followed.

   A notice to redeem from tax sale substantially complying with the statute is not invalid because of a trifling in accuracy which does not prejudice anyone. Baird v.

   Fact that husband misled wife to believe that indemnity agreement she was signing was bond was no defense to wife’s liability, after marriage had terminated, where surety was not party to any fraud by husband and no agency relationship existed between surety and husband; surety was innocent party, and thus wife was required to be sufferer under this subsection; additional factor of abuse of confidential relationship between husband and wife did not justify application of different rule.

   The records in the office of the register of deeds [now recorder] are a readily available means of information as to titles to land, and a purchaser at a decedent’s estate sale who has not checked the records cannot claim estoppel against the widow who failed to inform him of her separate undivided interest.

   Where deeds were given as mortgages rather than instruments passing title, and defendant had induced plaintiff to “purchase” lots and plaintiff financed improvements on lots in defendant’s possession, since defendant knew title had not passed to plaintiff, he was estopped from claiming any interest in lots. Sorenson v. Olson, 235 N.W.2d 892, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1975).

   Equitable estoppel will be found only where party charged was apprised of true state of his title, made statement with intention to deceive, other party was destitute of knowledge and of means of acquiring knowledge as to true state of title, and latter relied upon statement to his injury.

   Summary judgment was inappropriate where an insurance adjuster failed to disclose an insured’s death while pursuing settlement negotiations in an auto accident case because equitable estoppel under this section could have been invoked to extend the limitations period, although service on the widower under N.D.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(2)(A)(v) did not constitute service on a personal representative and N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-01s28-01-24" target="_blank">28-01-24</a></cite> did not extend the statute of limitations on fraud grounds.

         Elements of Equitable Estoppel.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>

   The basic elements of an equitable estoppel, insofar as it relates to the person being estopped, are conduct which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts, or, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; the intention, or at least the expectation, that such conduct will be acted upon by, or will influence, the other party or persons; and knowledge, actual or constructive, of the real facts. Insofar as related to the party claiming the estoppel, the elements are lack of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; reliance, in good faith, upon the conduct or statements of the party to be estopped; and action or inaction based thereon, of such a character as to change the position or status of the party claiming the estoppel, to his injury, detriment, or prejudice. Farmers Coop. Ass'n v. Cole, 239 N.W.2d 808, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1976); Cooke v. Blood Sys., 320 N.W.2d 124, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   Insofar as it relates to the person being estopped, elements of an equitable estoppel are: conduct which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts, or, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; the intention, or at least the expectation, that such conduct will be acted upon by, or will influence, the other party; and knowledge, actual or constructive, of the real facts. O'Connell v. Entertainment Enters., 317 N.W.2d 385, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>

   Defendant, seeking to prove equitable estoppel, had to establish: (1) its lack of knowledge and the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; (2) its good faith reliance upon the conduct or statements of plaintiff, and; (3) its action or inaction based thereon, which resulted in a change of its position to its injury. Kouba v. Great Plains Pelleting, 372 N.W.2d 884, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 372</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        To prevail on a claim of equitable estoppel a party must show: (1) conduct which constitutes a false representation; (2) the intention to cause another person to rely on that conduct, and; (3) that the party having made the false representation had knowledge of the true facts. A party claiming estoppel must have lacked knowledge of the true facts and must have relied on the false representation to his or her injury. Farmer's Union Cent. Exchange, Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 626 F. Supp. 583, 1985 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15712 (D.N.D. 1985).

        Since the prospective lessee could not allege a claim that entitled him to relief regarding his alleged three-year oral lease of trucks, the court granted the prospective truck lessor’s motion for judgment on the pleadings; the three-year oral lease violated the statute of frauds, and the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not apply to defeat the statute of frauds defense since complaint did not allege the fraud, positive misrepresentation, or unconscionable conduct necessary to invoke equitable estoppel.

   A widow with a grade-school education who signs a declaration denying any interest in the land sold as part of her deceased husband’s estate when in fact she held an undivided interest in such land is not estopped from asserting her title unless she was apprised of the true state of her own title, she made the admission with the intention to deceive or with such careless and culpable negligence as to amount to constructive fraud, and the buyer at the administrator’s sale was misled by such error when the real facts were not open for his immediate ascertainment.

   Estoppel against government is not absolutely barred as a matter of law, even in matters concerning taxation; however, doctrine of estoppel is not one which should be applied freely against government, but likewise it is not one which should never be available, and it must be applied on a case by case basis with a careful weighing of inequities that would result if doctrine is not applied versus public interest at stake and resulting harm to that interest if doctrine is applied.

   North Dakota Department of Human Services was not estopped from denying Medicaid payment for child’s out-of-state care, where the child presented evidence that a hospital representative believed she had secured verbal approval for payment of the child’s medical care two days after he was discharged from the hospital and the testimony of the hospital’s representative reflected that it did not receive any type of approval while it was providing the child’s care, and the child had already been discharged when the hospital claimed the Department approved payment. Thus, the child failed to show detrimental reliance on the Department’s conduct or statements and failed to establish the basic elements of estoppel. J.P. v. Stark County Soc.

   Medical providers had no liability on an equitable estoppel theory for expenses and attorney fees incurred by a patient’s conservators in securing payments from an insurance company because an alleged statement by a provider’s employee expressing an opinion about whether it would be worthwhile to sue the insurance company did not amount to affirmative deceptive conduct. Moreover, equitable estoppel does not by itself give rise to a cause of action and cannot be used to create an enforceable agreement.

   State law equitable estoppel claim was preempted by federal law, because any state-law cause of action that duplicated, supplemented, or supplanted the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) civil enforcement remedy conflicted with the clear congressional intent to make the ERISA remedy exclusive and was therefore preempted; Federal law permitted the company to terminate its health or other medical benefit plans under ERISA at any time after the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement governing the benefit plans, and the company lawfully terminated its coverage of post-retirement health benefits to the retired employees even after providing them benefits for over fourteen years after they first retired.

       DNA testing — Admissibility as evidence.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In any court proceeding, DNA testing is deemed to be a reliable scientific technique, and the evidence of a DNA profile comparison must be admitted as prima facie evidence to prove or disprove the identity of any person. This section does not otherwise limit the introduction of any relevant evidence bearing upon any question at issue before the court. The court, regardless of the results of the DNA analysis, if any, shall consider other relevant evidence of the identity of the person as is admissible in evidence.

DNA samples must be collected immediately, but may be preserved by the department for subsequent analysis upon receipt of sufficient funding. Any individual convicted after July 31, 1995, who is not sentenced to a term of confinement, shall provide a sample of blood or other body fluids as a condition of the sentence or probation at a time and place specified by the sentencing court.
