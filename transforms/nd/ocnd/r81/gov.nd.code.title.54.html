   If property escheats to the state, the latter takes only the title which the decedent had, and no other, subject to all charges, liens and encumbrances. In re Gonsky's Estate, 79 N.D. 123, 55 N.W.2d 60, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1952).

   If the property escheats to the state through failure of title on account of the nonexistence of a person capable of succeeding to the estate of a decedent, the state does not take the property by succession or as the last heir of the decedent; therefore, the county court has no power in probate proceedings to decree an escheat.

      Except as provided by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t54c54-01s54-01-05.5" target="_self">54-01-05.5</a></cite>, whenever any department or agency of the state other than the board of university and school lands, the housing finance agency, and the Bank of North Dakota is authorized to sell such real property, the property must be sold for cash by the county auditor or other person designated by the department or agency concerned at public auction at the front door of the courthouse in the county in which the property lies. A notice of sale must have been published in the official newspaper of the county in which the property lies for three successive weeks, with the last publication not less than ten days before the day of sale. The notice must be given in the name of the administrative head of the department or agency concerned and must state the place, day, and hour of the sale, the description of the real property to be sold, the appraised value, and that the state reserves the right to reject any and all bids. No land may be sold at auction for less than the appraised value. In addition to the purchase price at auction, the buyer must pay the cost of preparing the land for sale. For a land sale or exchange when the value of the land is not more than one hundred thousand dollars, one appraisal must be obtained, and when the value of the land is in excess of one hundred thousand dollars, two appraisals must be obtained. If more than one appraisal is obtained, the appraised value of the land is the average of the two appraisals. If no bid is received on the land at public auction, the land may be sold for not less than ninety percent of the appraised value.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A state agency may, when it deems such action to be in the best interest of the state, grant easements upon or across any real property which it administers and which is owned by the state for the use or benefit of a state institution under its jurisdiction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any property rights transferred under the authority of this section must be transferred and conveyed by quitclaim instrument or easement executed in the name of the state of North Dakota by the governor and attested by the secretary of state. Such quitclaim instrument or easement must contain specific legal descriptions of the property right transferred and the location thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the granting of an easement under the authority of this section any proceeds must be used in the following manner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54c54-01s54-01-17.1ol11">
       If the property is the subject of a devise, legacy, bequest, or gift to the institution the proceeds of the easement are subject to the provisions of sections 1-08-02 and 1-08-04.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-01s54-01-17.1ol12">
       If the property is not subject to sections 1-08-02 and 1-08-04, the proceeds of the easement must be deposited in the special operating fund of the institution or, if no such operating fund then exists, such proceeds must be deposited in the general fund in the state treasury.

       <p>

   A resident of a certain county or political subdivision of the state may become a nonresident by performance of an act indicative of an intention to abandon his then residence and to establish a residence elsewhere, accompanied by a then present intention to accomplish such purpose. City of Enderlin v. Pontiac Township, 62 N.D. 105, 242 N.W. 117, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>

   A person who qualifies as an elector does not lose his status as a resident by voluntary absence from the county unless he actually abandons his residence therein and gains a residence elsewhere. City of Enderlin v. Pontiac Township, 62 N.D. 105, 242 N.W. 117, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>

   Leaving a place of residence does not constitute an abandonment thereof unless the resident establishes another, and a new residence can be established only by the union of act and intent. State ex rel. Sathre v. Moodie, 65 N.D. 340, 258 N.W. 558, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>

   A domicile once existing cannot be lost by mere abandonment, even when coupled with the intent to acquire a new one, but continues until a new one is in fact gained. Northwestern Mortgage &amp; Sec. Co. v. Noel Constr. Co., 71 N.D. 256, 300 N.W. 28, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>

   A person having his legal residence in the state, who removes from the place of his domicile with the intention not to reside there any longer and to remove to another state, is still a resident of this state as long as he remains herein. Northwestern Mortgage &amp; Sec. Co. v. Noel Constr. Co., 71 N.D. 256, 300 N.W. 28, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1941).
       </p>
       <p>

   A schoolteacher and his wife did not lose their residency by moving from Killdeer to Grand Forks for one year so that the husband could secure a graduate degree at the university; there was no showing of intent permanently to change residence and the husband and wife were entitled to absent voters’ ballots for voting at a bond election in the Killdeer Public School District. Mittelstadt v. Bender, 210 N.W.2d 89, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Closely akin to the issue of homestead abandonment is the issue of abandonment of a legal residency. Here too the law looks to action coupled with intent, with intent being the principal focus. As codified by this section, a residence cannot be changed until another is gained and can be changed only by the union of act and intent. In re Lippert, 113 B.R. 576, 1990 Bankr. LEXIS 867 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1990).

   There is a presumption against a change of legal residence, and the burden of proving a change of legal residence is on the person alleging the change. B.R.T. v. Executive Director of Social Service Bd., 391 N.W.2d 594, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 359</cite> (N.D. 1986).

   Moving from one place of residence to another with the intent to abandon the old residence and establish a new residence is in law a change of residence which may be accomplished in one day between townships. Burke County v. Oakland, 56 N.D. 343, 217 N.W. 643, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1927).
       </p>
       <p>

   A nonresident may become a resident of the state upon the performance of some act indicative of an intention to establish a residence within the state, coupled with an actual present intention to establish such a residence. City of Enderlin v. Pontiac Township, 62 N.D. 105, 242 N.W. 117, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>

   To effect a change of domicile the fact of physical presence at a dwelling place and the intention to make it a home must concur; if they do, even for a moment, the change of domicile takes place. Schillerstrom v. Schillerstrom, 75 N.D. 667, 32 N.W.2d 106, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>

   Plaintiff must prove three elements to establish defendant’s change of residence: (1) abandonment of the old domicile, (2) actual removal to a new domicile, and (3) intent to change from the old to the new and to remain at the new domicile. Keating v. Keating, 399 N.W.2d 872, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>

   To find a change of domicile, the fact of a physical presence at a residence must concur with the intent to make that place the legal residence, “the union of act and intent.” The person’s intent must be determined from the person’s conduct and declarations. In re Estate of Burshiem, 483 N.W.2d 175, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 1992).

Indeed, it is recognized that neither the fact of removal from the property nor the length of time away will defeat an established homestead or place of legal residency unless such removal is coupled with the requisite intent.

      The purpose of this chapter is to establish a uniform policy for the fair and equitable treatment of persons displaced as a direct result of programs or projects undertaken by a state agency so that displaced persons will not suffer disproportionate injuries as a result of programs and projects designed for the benefit of the public as a whole and to minimize the hardship of displacement by the acquisition of real property by state and local land acquisition programs, by federally assisted building code enforcement programs, or by a program of voluntary rehabilitation of buildings or other improvements conducted pursuant to governmental supervision. The policy must be uniform as to:

   Where compensation has been received for property damaged by eminent domain, this section does not prohibit compensation for the relocation of the same property; there is no basis for a distinction in awarding or denying benefits under this section on the premises of whether or not the property to be removed was damaged as a result of eminent domain. Schnaible v. Bismarck, 275 N.W.2d 859, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1979).

   Where compensation under this chapter arises from the same injury for which compensation is awarded in an eminent domain proceeding the property owner is not entitled to be doubly compensated for the same injury, but where the basis for compensation arises from a different injury or theory, the property owner is not precluded from seeking compensation under both this chapter and in eminent domain; owner of trade fixtures located in property condemned pursuant to eminent domain who removed the fixtures after the condemnation and accepted an “in lieu” relocation payment under this section did not waive his entitlement to compensation under the North Dakota Constitution for damage to the fixtures as a result of the condemnation since the relocation payment was for a separate and distinct economic loss than that provided for by the North Dakota Constitution.

   Acceptance of “in lieu” relocation payments does not necessarily mean the property itself cannot be removed by the property owner or that he cannot receive compensation in eminent domain proceedings for damages arising as a result of the removal; to conclude that a property owner cannot remove his property after receiving an “in lieu” relocation payment could result in an effective taking of property without providing for compensation.

       State flag.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The flag of North Dakota must consist of a field of blue silk or material which will withstand the elements four feet four inches [132.08 centimeters] on the pike and five feet six inches [167.64 centimeters] on the fly, with a border of knotted yellow fringe two and one-half inches [6.35 centimeters] wide. On each side of said flag in the center thereof, must be embroidered or stamped an eagle with outspread wings and with opened beak. The eagle must be three feet four inches [101.6 centimeters] from tip to tip of wing, and one foot ten inches [55.88 centimeters] from top of head to bottom of olive branch hereinafter described. The left foot of the eagle shall grasp a sheaf of arrows, the right foot shall grasp an olive branch showing three red berries. On the breast of the eagle must be displayed a shield, the lower part showing seven red and six white stripes placed alternately. Through the open beak of the eagle must pass a scroll bearing the words “E Pluribus Unum”. Beneath the eagle there must be a scroll on which must be borne the words “North Dakota”. Over the scroll carried through the eagle’s beak must be shown thirteen five-pointed stars, the whole device being surmounted by a sunburst. The flag must conform in all respects as to color, form, size, and device with the regimental flag carried by the First North Dakota Infantry in the Spanish American War and Philippine Insurrection, except in the words shown on the scroll below the eagle. To ensure historical accuracy, reproductions of the flag of North Dakota must adhere to the official design and industry color chart codes provided by the state historical society. A description in writing of the flag must be made available to the public by the state historical society. Flags purchased by a state entity or a political subdivision must substantially meet the requirements of this section. This section does not apply to the purchase of an item that is not a flag but which portrays a likeness of the flag of North Dakota, for example, a miniature flag, food, clothing, a lapel pin, a paper product, or other nonflag item.

      There shall be awarded by the state of North Dakota, in the name of the legislative assembly and the citizens of this state, an award to be known as the Theodore Roosevelt rough rider award. The award is the highest recognition by the state of present or former North Dakotans who have been influenced by this state in achieving national recognition in their fields of endeavor, thereby reflecting credit and honor upon this state and its citizens. The award is not for momentary success, but only for genuine achievements of lasting significance. It is the intent of this section to guard the dignity of the rough rider award for recipients of the past as well as the future. The award, of a type and design approved by the governor, must be awarded by the governor upon the concurrence of the secretary of state and the director of the state historical society. A record of all such awards and pertinent information in regard to each recipient must be retained by the state archivist.

       Legislative redistricting requirements.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A legislative redistricting plan based on any census taken after 1999 must meet the following requirements:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54c54-03s54-03-01.5ol11">
       The senate must consist of forty-seven members and the house must consist of ninety-four members.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-03s54-03-01.5ol12">
       Except as provided in subsection 3, one senator and two representatives must be apportioned to each senatorial district. Representatives may be elected at large or from subdistricts.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-03s54-03-01.5ol13">
       Multimember senate districts providing for two senators and four representatives are authorized only when a proposed single-member senatorial district includes a federal facility or federal installation, containing over two-thirds of the population of the proposed single-member senatorial district.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-03s54-03-01.5ol14">
       Legislative districts and subdistricts must be compact and of contiguous territory.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-03s54-03-01.5ol15">
       Legislative districts must be as nearly equal in population as is practicable. Population deviation from district to district must be kept at a minimum. The total population variance of all districts, and subdistricts if created, from the average district population may not exceed recognized constitutional limitations.
      </li>

         Justification of Variations in District Size.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The state’s defense of its 1975 redistricting plan, which embodied a total variance from strict mathematical equality of district population of 20.17% and an average deviation per district of 1 4.65%, in which it sought to justify these variations by reference to (1) the sparse population of rural areas, (2) recognition of the natural boundary of the Missouri River, and (3) the state policy of preserving the integrity of county lines, was insufficient to overcome the prima facie unconstitutionality of a plan with such wide variances in district size. Chapman v. Meier, 407 F. Supp. 649, 1975 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16749 (D.N.D. 1975).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The preservation of the integrity of its political subdivisions is a legitimate state goal, and the drawing of legislative district boundaries along county lines might well justify some deviation from mathematical equality of district size, but in a plan with fifty legislative districts/subdistricts, in which thirteen, including three of the eight districts with the largest deviations in size, broke county lines, the state failed to show that the deviations in its plan were incident to the policy of preserving the integrity of those lines.

        Court-ordered reapportionment must avoid use of multimember districts, and must achieve the goal of population equality with little more than minimal variation; and where significant considerations mandate departure from the standards, it is the reapportioning court’s responsibility to explain why the standards cannot be met.

     <p>
      The secretary and officers of the senate and chief clerk and officers of the house serving at the close of a regular session, unless otherwise removed, shall remain in office until the first day of the organizational session. On the first day of the organizational session, at a time scheduled by the legislative management pursuant to section 54-03.1-02, the president of the senate and the speaker of the house from the previous session, if re-elected, or in the speaker’s absence a member of the majority party of the house with seniority based upon terms of service in the house, shall call the members of their respective houses so enrolled to order. In the absence of the president of the senate, the president pro tempore shall call the members of the senate to order. In the absence of both the president of the senate and the president pro tempore, then some member or other person selected by the members present shall call the members of the senate to order. If the speaker of the house from the previous session is not re-elected and if no party has a majority in the house, the member of the house with seniority based upon terms of service in the house shall call the house to order. If two or more members of the house are tied for seniority and seniority is a factor in determining who shall call the house to order, the persons so tied for seniority shall draw lots to determine who shall call the house to order. The members of the respective houses then may proceed to the election of the necessary officers. The secretary and officers of the senate and chief clerk and officers of the house of representatives, and the chairmen of all procedural and substantive standing legislative committees shall continue to serve in those positions during any special legislative session which may be called, except in case of the death, resignation, or removal of one of those persons, whereupon the position must be filled, upon the convening of the special session, in the manner provided by law or legislative rule. Members serving on procedural or substantive standing committees of the senate or house during a regular session shall continue to serve on those committees during any special legislative session which may be called following that regular session.

      A member of the legislative assembly who is a witness or party to a civil action or has been the attorney of record for a party in a civil action for more than fifteen days is entitled to a continuance or an extension of time for any matter related to the civil action during the time the member of the legislative assembly is actually engaged in the performance of the member’s duties at a session of the legislative assembly and attendance of the member of the legislative assembly is necessary in the action. Upon application for the continuance or extension, the proceeding must be continued and may not proceed within ten days after the adjournment of the legislative assembly over the objection of the party, witness, or attorney of record. Notice of motion, together with a copy of an affidavit stating that the party, witness, or the attorney of record is a member of the legislative assembly, must be served upon every other party to the action at least ten days before the date of the matter sought to be continued. It is sufficient cause for the continuance of any proceeding before any board, commission, or agency of the state or its political subdivisions that any witness, party to the proceeding, or a party’s attorney is a member of the legislative assembly and the legislative assembly is in session. The witness, party, or the party’s attorney shall give written notice of the fact of membership in the legislative assembly along with a request for continuance of the proceeding to the board, commission, or agency before which the member of the legislative assembly was to appear. Upon receipt of the notices, the board shall continue the proceeding to a date not less than ten days after adjournment of the legislative assembly and shall notify the other parties to the proceeding, and their attorneys, of the continuance.

     </p>
     <p>
      Section 1. Total outlays of the government of the United States shall not exceed total receipts of the government of the United States at any point in time unless the excess of outlays over receipts is financed exclusively by debt issued in strict conformity with this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 2. Outstanding debt shall not exceed authorized debt, which initially shall be an amount equal to 105 percent of the outstanding debt on the effective date of this article. Authorized debt shall not be increased above its aforesaid initial amount unless such increase is first approved by the legislatures of the several states as provided in Section 3.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 3. From time to time, Congress may increase authorized debt to an amount in excess of its initial amount set by Section 2 only if it first publicly refers to the legislatures of the several states an unconditional, single subject measure proposing the amount of such increase, in such form as provided by law, and the measure is thereafter publicly and unconditionally approved by a simple majority of the legislatures of the several states, in such form as provided respectively by state law; provided that no inducement requiring an expenditure or tax levy shall be demanded, offered or accepted as a quid pro quo for such approval. If such approval is not obtained within sixty (60) calendar days after referral then the measure shall be deemed disapproved and the authorized debt shall thereby remain unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 4. Whenever the outstanding debt exceeds 98 percent of the debt limit set by Section 2, the President shall enforce said limit by publicly designating specific expenditures for impoundment in an amount sufficient to ensure outstanding debt shall not exceed the authorized debt. Said impoundment shall become effective thirty (30) days thereafter, unless Congress first designates an alternate impoundment of the same or greater amount by concurrent resolution, which shall become immediately effective. The failure of the President to designate or enforce the required impoundment is an impeachable misdemeanor. Any purported issuance or incurrence of any debt in excess of the debt limit set by Section 2 is void.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 5. No bill that provides for a new or increased general revenue tax shall become law unless approved by a two-thirds roll call vote of the whole number of each House of Congress. However, this requirement shall not apply to any bill that provides for a new end user sales tax which would completely replace every existing income tax levied by the government of the United States; or for the reduction or elimination of an exemption, deduction, or credit allowed under an existing general revenue tax.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 6. For purposes of this article, “debt” means any obligation backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the United States; “outstanding debt” means all debt held in any account and by any entity at a given point in time; “authorized debt” means the maximum total amount of debt that may be lawfully issued and outstanding at any single point in time under this article; “total outlays of the government of the United States” means all expenditures of the government of the United States from any source; “total receipts of the government of the United States” means all tax receipts and other income of the government of the United States, excluding proceeds from its issuance or incurrence of debt or any type of liability; “impoundment” means a proposal not to spend all or part of a sum of money appropriated by Congress; and “general revenue tax” means any income tax, sales tax, or value-added tax levied by the government of the United States excluding imposts and duties.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 7. This article is immediately operative upon ratification, self-enforcing, and Congress may enact conforming legislation to facilitate enforcement.

However, to prevent disruption of proceedings, no more than three delegates may attend and participate in the Convention on behalf of any state. A certified chaptered conforming copy of this compact, together with government-issued photographic proof of identification, shall suffice as credentials for delegates of member states.

       Penalty.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter is guilty of a class B misdemeanor except that a violation of section 54-05.1-02 or 54-05.1-03 is an infraction. Whether a person is subjected to criminal prosecution under this section, and in addition to the registration fee that may be assessed when the person submits the registration to the secretary of state, the person may be assessed a civil penalty by the secretary of state, following written notice to the person of an intent to assess the penalty, in an amount not to exceed two times the amount set forth in subdivision e of subsection 1 of section 54-05.1-03 which is chargeable to a lobbyist. Any civil penalty must be assessed and collected before a person is issued a certificate of registration. The assessment of a civil penalty may be appealed to the district court of the person’s county of residence or Burleigh County, but only on the basis that the secretary of state’s administrative determination that the person acted as a lobbyist when not registered as a lobbyist was clearly erroneous.

      All departments, institutions, or agencies of the state may maintain, subject to approval of the state auditor and the state treasurer, in the Bank of North Dakota, or, if the state entity is located outside Bismarck, in another state or federally chartered financial institution, an account for clearing or cashing of checks and making change. To accommodate peak processing periods, the balance in an account at a financial institution other than the Bank of North Dakota may exceed the maximum amount of federal insurance coverage available if the excess in the account is secured by another form of security or security deposit; however, the balance may exceed the maximum amount of federal insurance coverage available only for the time it takes to clear the checks. Any check written on the account may be used only to transfer funds to the Bank of North Dakota or the state treasurer. A financial institution shall report to the state auditor in writing within thirty days after opening or closing an account for a state entity under this section. Subject to the approval of the state auditor, a state entity may maintain a cash balance reasonable for the conduct of business at the location of the entity.

Mileage by private aircraft must be computed by actual air mileage when only one state employee or official is traveling; if two or more state employees or officials are traveling by private aircraft, the actual mileage must be based on the road mileage between the geographical points.

       Annual leave and sick leave for state employees.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Annual leave and sick leave must be provided for all persons in the permanent employment of this state who are not employed under a written contract of hire setting forth the terms and conditions of their employment, within the limitations, terms, and provisions of this section. Annual leave for an employee entitled to it must be within a range of a minimum of one working day per month of employment to a maximum of two working days per month of employment, based on tenure of employment, to be fixed by rules adopted by the employing unit. Sick leave for an employee entitled to it must be within a range of a minimum of one working day per month of employment to a maximum of one and one-half working days per month of employment, based on tenure of employment, to be fixed by rules adopted by the employing unit. Annual leave must be compensated for on the basis of full pay for the number of working days’ leave credited to the employee. Sick leave must be compensated for on the basis of full pay for absence due to illness on working days during tenure of employment. An employee with at least ten continuous years of state employment is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to one-tenth of the pay attributed to the employee’s unused sick leave accrued under this section. An employee’s years of state employment must be deemed continuous if, under the official personnel policy of an agency, unit, or entity, the employee’s work is terminated because of a reduction in force and the employee is reinstated in any agency, unit, or entity within two years, or if the employee is placed on voluntary leave status without pay and the leave lasts no longer than two years for education purposes, or one year for any other voluntary leave without pay. The pay attributed to the accumulated, unused sick leave must be computed on the basis of the employee’s salary or wage at the time the employee leaves the employ of the state and at the rate of one hour of pay for each hour of unused sick leave. The agency, unit, or entity that last employed the employee shall make the lump sum payment from funds appropriated by the legislative assembly to that agency, unit, or entity for salaries and wages. Any state agency, unit, or entity which employs persons subject to this section shall formulate and adopt rules governing the granting of annual leave and sick leave which will effectuate the purpose of this section and best suit the factors of employment of that employing unit. Each employing unit shall file with the office of management and budget a copy of the rules adopted, including any amendments or additions to the rules.

Direct computer access is equivalent to oral confirmation, and a computer printout constitutes the written confirmation of the secretary of state, if use of this method of confirmation does not cause the central indexing system to lose federal certification. A computer printout from the computerized central indexing system constitutes the certificate of the secretary of state as to whether there is on file, on the date and hour stated on the computer printout, a financing statement.

   Statute appropriating five hundred dollars annually to each judge of the supreme court for expenses incurred in his official capacity did not require audit by any officer and therefore no itemized statement of the claim had to be made. State ex rel. Langer v. Kositzky, 38 N.D. 616, 166 N.W. 534, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 4</cite> (N.D. 1918).

       </h5>
       <p>

   State auditor was without authority to issue a warrant for payment of an award made by workmen’s compensation bureau. State ex rel. Stearns v. Olson, 43 N.D. 619, 175 N.W. 714, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1919).
       </p>
       <p>

   It was not part of auditor’s duties to examine the Bank of North Dakota. State ex rel. Kozitzky v. Waters, 45 N.D. 115, 176 N.W. 913, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>

   The state auditor could question the constitutionality of a statute upon which proceedings had been instituted to compel him to disburse funds. Department of State Highways v. Baker, 69 N.D. 702, 290 N.W. 257, 1940 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>

   Where state auditor resisted performance of duties as outlined by statute, without first requesting an opinion from the attorney general, or in disregard of such opinion, he could not question the constitutionality of such statute as a defense to a mandamus proceeding to compel performance. State ex rel. Johnson v. Baker, 74 N.D. 244, 21 N.W.2d 355 (1945), distinguished, Solberg v. State Treasurer, 78 N.D. 806, 53 N.W.2d 49 (1952) and State v.

       </h5>
       <p>

   If there were moneys in the general fund with which to pay salary of tax commissioner, a writ of mandamus would issue to compel payment. State ex rel. Wallace v. Kositzky, 44 N.D. 291, 175 N.W. 207, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 1919).
       </p>
       <p>

   The auditor was not authorized to transfer moneys from the general fund to a separate fund. State ex rel. Wallace v. Kositzky, 44 N.D. 291, 175 N.W. 207, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 1919).

       </h5>
       <p>

   No liability accrued under the auditor’s official bond if he was acting upon advice of the attorney general concerning the constitutionality of a statute requiring him to perform a ministerial act. State ex rel. Johnson v. Baker, 74 N.D. 244, 21 N.W.2d 355 (1945), distinguished, Solberg v. State Treasurer, 78 N.D. 806, 53 N.W.2d 49 (1952) and State v.

      The governing board of any occupational or professional board shall provide for an audit once every two years by a certified public accountant or licensed public accountant. The accountant conducting the audit shall submit the audit report to the state auditor’s office. If the report is in the form and style prescribed by the state auditor, the state auditor may not audit that board. An occupational or professional board may request the state auditor to conduct its audit, and if the state auditor agrees to conduct the audit, the state auditor shall deposit the fees charged to the occupational or professional board into the state auditor operating account. Instead of providing for an audit every two years, an occupational or professional board that has less than two hundred thousand dollars of annual receipts may submit an annual report to the state auditor. The report must contain the information required by the state auditor. The state auditor also may make any additional examination or audit determined necessary in addition to the annual report. When a report is not filed, the state auditor may charge the occupational or professional board an amount equal to the fair value of the additional examination or audit and any other services rendered. The state auditor may charge an occupational or professional board a fee not to exceed eighty-six dollars an hour for the costs of reviewing the annual report.

      If the state auditor upon examination finds that the books of the state treasurer do not correspond with the amount of funds on hand, or do not show the actual condition of the funds, or if it appears to the state auditor that any moneys belonging to the state have been embezzled, diverted, or in any manner taken from the treasury without authority of law, or that the state treasurer has been guilty of negligence in keeping books or taking care of the public moneys, the auditor shall certify the fact to the governor. Upon the receipt of such certificate, the governor forthwith shall take possession of all books, moneys, papers, and other property belonging to the state, which have come into the possession of the state treasurer by virtue of that office, or otherwise, and shall temporarily suspend the state treasurer from that office.

   Where state sought an advisory opinion on a question of the role and duty of the office of state’s attorney, which was not ripe for review and for which no meaningful relief could be granted, appeal was dismissed; the attorney general, not the supreme court, is the proper legal advisor for state’s attorneys.

   State had interest in action for declaration that insurance policy was void ab initio since, if policy was found void, the unsatisfied judgment fund might be exposed to liability; therefore state was entitled to have attorney general appear and represent it although it had not been named as a party.

   Fact that attorney general may be concerned that a statute is not being complied with does not make him an interested party to the proceedings, and “interested” is not synonymous with “concerned”; suit for malpractice between parents of a deceased child and the child’s doctors was of a purely private nature, and gave attorney general no authority to initiate a proceeding in the supreme court asking for an order to prevent the district court from considering the parents’ complaint (on grounds the parents, on advice from two district judges, were bypassing the medical review panel procedure contained in former N.D.C.C. ch. 32-29.1).

   The attorney general is not intended to supplant the court, and his opinions prevail as to the constitutionality of a statute affecting the ministerial duties of state officers only until such questions are passed upon by the courts. State ex rel. Johnson v. Baker, 74 N.D. 244, 21 N.W.2d 355 (1945), distinguished, Solberg v. State Treasurer, 78 N.D. 806, 53 N.W.2d 49 (1952) and State v.

       The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that state imposition of term limits for congressional service must come through an amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Although the Arkansas term limits measure only precluded certain candidates from having their names appear on the ballot, such a term limits measure is unconstitutional when it has the likely effect of handicapping a class of candidates and has the sole purpose of indirectly creating additional qualifications.

       For the purposes of this section, “severance pay” means compensation received, upon termination of employment, for reasons primarily beyond the control of the state employee or officer. Severance pay does not include payments made to a terminated employee or officer for accrued annual or sick leave, or compensatory leave, when such payments are authorized.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-14s54-14-04.3ol12">
       Except as provided in subsection 3, no state employee or officer is entitled to severance pay upon termination of employment if the employee or officer quit employment voluntarily or resigned of the person’s own accord, or was dismissed for gross neglect of duty, gross misconduct while on duty, or for other good cause. A state employee or officer may be entitled to severance pay if the employee or officer was dismissed from employment because of reductions in staff or temporary or permanent layoffs, or for other reasons primarily beyond the control of the employee or officer. This section does not affect the rights of employees or officers in salary or wage disputes which are the subject of out-of-court settlements.

     <p>
      The emergency commission consists of the governor, the majority leaders of the senate and house of representatives of the legislative assembly, the secretary of state, and the chairmen of the senate and house of representatives appropriations committees. If the chairman of an appropriations committee ceases to be a member of the legislative assembly, the vice chairman of that committee succeeds to that position on the commission. An appropriations committee vice chairman may serve in the place of the appropriations committee chairman as a member of the commission at the request of the appropriate appropriations committee chairman, if the appropriations committee chairman is unable to attend a commission meeting. If a majority leader ceases to be a member of the legislative assembly, the respective house’s assistant majority leader succeeds to that position on the commission. A majority leader’s assistant majority leader may serve as a member of the commission in the place of the majority leader at the request of the majority leader if that majority leader is serving on the commission in another capacity or is unable to attend a commission meeting. Four members of the commission constitute a quorum. The governor is the chairman and the secretary of state is the secretary of the commission. The commission shall meet at the call of the chairman.

        Emergency Appropriation.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   The allocation of money authorized by this chapter is limited to emergencies arising within established funds and departments for which appropriations have already been made, and the commission may not allocate moneys to create new funds or appropriations. Backman v. Guy, 126 N.W.2d 910, 1964 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1964).
      </p>
      <p>

   Where the federal government made funds available to the state on a matching basis, failure of the legislature to appropriate funds to meet the offer was not an “emergency” under this section and the commission acted improperly when it appropriated money for that purpose.

      Any board, agency, commission, or officer of the state, subject to the approval of the emergency commission, may borrow moneys from the Bank of North Dakota for the purpose of responding to a disaster within the state as declared by the governor pursuant to chapter 37-17.1. The amount of moneys borrowed is limited to the amount of any estimated federal reimbursement for repair, recovery, or response relating to a disaster within the state, unless the state contingencies appropriation is inadequate to pay the estimated state share of the costs, then moneys may be borrowed up to one hundred percent of the costs incurred by the agency. Any interest payments on the funds borrowed must be paid from funds available to the agency from the state contingencies appropriation as authorized by the emergency commission or other funds as authorized by the emergency commission. Any moneys borrowed from the Bank of North Dakota pursuant to this section are hereby appropriated and may be spent by the board, agency, commission, or officer of this state for the repair, recovery, or response relating to a disaster within the state. If it appears to the borrower that at the end of the biennium the amount available to repay the amount borrowed plus interest is insufficient to totally repay the Bank of North Dakota, the borrower shall request from the legislative assembly a deficiency appropriation sufficient for the repayment of the amount borrowed plus interest.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the industrial commission decides that it is in the public interest to diminish the investment of state funds in United States government guaranteed or reinsured or North Dakota guaranteed student loans, that it will be difficult to divest the state of appreciable amounts of such loans by piecemeal offering to the investing and saving public, that business conditions are favorable to a state-sponsored program to consolidate state-held student loans, and to enlarge private participation in such loans, or that the public will otherwise benefit, the commission may by plenary resolution duly adopted in accordance with the provisions hereof authorize preparation, sale, and issuance of revenue bonds of North Dakota in such amounts and at such times and in such form, which may include the issuance of bonds the interest income on which is subject to federal income taxes, as the commission shall determine to be for the public good. The industrial commission may issue subordinate or residual bonds whenever the industrial commission determines that it is appropriate or expedient to do so and the bonds may contain such terms and provisions as the commission may determine. The commission may refund and refinance the bonds from time to time as often as it is advantageous and in the public interest to do so. The bonds shall be a charge upon a sufficient designated portion of the resources of the student loan trusts, subject only to necessary administrative expenses of the trusts duly appropriated out of the interest earning resources thereof. The bonds may bear such rate or rates of interest as the commission may provide. The bonds must have all of the qualities and incidents of negotiable paper and are not subject to taxation by the state of North Dakota or by any county, municipality, or political subdivision therein. The bonds must be payable solely out of the separate resources generated respectively from collection of payments on and earnings and proceeds of United States government guaranteed or reinsured or North Dakota guaranteed student loans, and must respectively so recite. They are not indebtedness of the state of North Dakota or of any agency, board, department, or officer or agent thereof. Without limiting the foregoing, the commission may request the organization of a nonprofit corporation meeting the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended and redesignated as the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [Pub. L. 99-54], and as it may be amended from time to time, and enter into one or more agreements with such corporation providing for the establishment of a secondary market program in the state of North Dakota for the acquisition by the corporation of such loans made pursuant to title IV, part B of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [Pub. L. 89-329; 79 Stat. 1236; Pub. L. 99-498; 100 Stat. 1353; 20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.], as amended through December 31, 1996, as the commission shall, in its discretion, deem advisable.

The computation for the authorized general fund lease payments for a biennium must be based on the projected sales, use, and motor vehicle excise tax collections presented to the legislative assembly at the close of the most recently adjourned regular legislative session. Lease payment amounts for any particular project must be calculated as of the date the related bonds are issued.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds and declares that North Dakota’s lignite industry produces approximately thirty million tons of lignite annually, contributing to our state’s and nation’s energy independence by generating electricity for more than two million people in the northern great plains region and by producing synthetic natural gas from coal that heats three hundred thousand homes and businesses in eastern states, which is equivalent to over twenty thousand barrels of oil per day. The legislative assembly further finds and declares that North Dakota’s lignite industry generates over twenty-eight thousand direct and indirect jobs for North Dakota, nearly three billion dollars in annual business volume, and over one hundred three million dollars in annual tax revenue. The legislative assembly further finds and declares that it is an essential governmental function and public purpose to assist with the development and wise use of North Dakota’s vast lignite resources by supporting a lignite research, development, and marketing program that promotes economic, efficient, and clean uses of lignite and products derived from lignite in order to maintain and enhance development of North Dakota lignite and its products; support educational activities relating to the lignite industry; preserve and create jobs involved in the production and utilization of North Dakota lignite; ensure economic stability, growth, and opportunity in the lignite industry; and maintain a stable and competitive tax base for our state’s lignite industry for the general welfare of North Dakota. The legislative assembly further finds and declares that development of North Dakota’s lignite resources must be conducted in an environmentally sound manner that protects our state’s air, water, and soil resources as specified by applicable federal and state law.

     <p>
      In evaluating applications for funding from the lignite research fund for North Dakota’s lignite research, development, and marketing program, the industrial commission and lignite research council shall give priority to those projects, processes, or activities that will preserve existing jobs and production, which will create the greatest number of new jobs and most additional lignite production and economic growth potential in coal-producing counties or those counties with recoverable coal reserves, which will attract matching private industry investment equal to at least fifty percent or more of the total cost, and which will result in development and demonstration of a marketable lignite product or products with a high level of probability of near term commercialization. For marketing applications, priority must be given to those projects, processes, or activities that develop baseline information, implement specific marketing strategies, and otherwise contribute to the effective marketing of lignite and its products. For reclamation applications, priority must be given to those projects, processes, or activities that will reduce unnecessary regulatory costs and assist in effectively reclaiming surface mined land to its original or better productivity as soon as possible. Any projects, activities, or processes selected by the commission for funding must achieve the priorities and purposes of the program, must have undergone technical review and be determined to have technical merit, must have generated matching private industry investment, and must have received a favorable lignite research council recommendation.

      For the purpose of encouraging and promoting agriculture, commerce, and industry, the state of North Dakota shall engage in the business of manufacturing and marketing farm products. For that purpose it shall establish a system of warehouses, elevators, flour mills, factories, plants, machinery, and equipment, owned, controlled, and operated by it under the name of North Dakota mill and elevator association. The business of the association, in addition to other matters specified in this chapter, may include anything that any private individual, corporation, or limited liability company lawfully may do in conducting a similar business except as restricted by the provisions of this chapter. In the creation of the association, it is the intention of the legislative assembly that all acts of the association are the acts of the state of North Dakota functioning in its sovereign and governmental capacity. The association is not a separate agency of the sovereign power, but is the state itself functioning.

        The issuance of bonds and levying of a tax on all nonexempt property in the state to build and operate state-owned industries and utilities does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Green v. Frazier, 253 U.S. 233, 40 S. Ct. 499, 64 L. Ed. 878, 1920 U.S. LEXIS 1418 (U.S. 1920).

        The state mill and elevator association is not subject to suit by a foreign corporation in a federal court for a claim arising from an alleged breach of contract. North Dakota v. National Milling &amp; Cereal Co., 114 F.2d 777, 1940 U.S. App. LEXIS 3211 (8th Cir. N.D. 1940).

        Action against the North Dakota Mill and Elevator Association is an action against the state; the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution provides the state immunity from such an action in the federal courts, and this section does not waive that immunity. Burlington Northern, Inc. v. North Dakota, 460 F. Supp. 140, 1978 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14415 (D.N.D. 1978).

   A civil action lies against the state, doing business as the North Dakota mill and elevator association, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained through the negligence of the association in the operation of a mill.

      The capital of the association must be any funds procured by the industrial commission through the sale of state bonds, as may be provided by law for that purpose, and also all moneys raised by the mill tax for terminal elevators as provided in sections 2072 and 2073 of the Compiled Laws of 1913. Said moneys must be paid to the manager of said association and the manager shall place the same in the general fund of the association.

       Annual audit of association.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The books, records, accounts, inventories, stocks of merchandise, supplies, equipment, and all affairs of the association must be audited and examined once in each year by the state auditor. The audit must be made as soon as possible after June thirtieth in each year. Said audit and the report thereof must disclose fairly and accurately the actual condition of the association as of June thirtieth of that year. Profits and losses may be computed only on such contracts and commitments, or parts thereof, as have been completed on said date, and no estimates of forecasts may be made as to the probable loss or gain on transactions to be fulfilled after said date. Inventories of grains, supplies, and stocks on hand must be computed on the basis of cost or market, on a consistent basis, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The report may disclose the actual obligations and commitments of the association on existing unfulfilled contracts, and the consideration and prices fixed in said contracts, if, in the judgment of said state auditor, the same are necessary to a complete audit, but the report constitutes a factual report of existing conditions, and, to the fullest extent possible, all estimates, forecasts, and probabilities must be eliminated therefrom. Copies of such audit report upon completion must be filed with the industrial commission, the manager of the association, with the state auditor, and a consolidated balance sheet and operating statement must be made public.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the contractor to whom a contract for construction or the provision of equipment to the association is let properly performs the work therein designated, the mill manager, at least once in each calendar month during the continuance of the contract work, shall meet, receive, and consider estimates furnished by the agent, engineer, or architect acting for the association or if not so furnished, then by the contractor, and shall allow such estimates in an amount of the estimated value of the labor and material furnished upon the contract, and of the material then upon the ground for use in the contract, subject to retentions of ten percent of each estimate presented until the time the project is fifty percent completed, with no further retainage on estimates during the continuance of the contract. Notwithstanding the requirements of any other law, the industrial commission may authorize the mill manager to prepay for equipment prior to delivery to the construction site if the industrial commission determines:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54c54-18s54-18-18ol11">
       Prepayment is in the best interest of the association;

      <li id="t54c54-18s54-18-18ol12">
       The association’s interest will be adequately protected; and
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-18s54-18-18ol13">
       The equipment is of a type that is not fungible and could not be sold except at a discount to another because it is constructed to specifications required by the association.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Upon completion of ninety-five percent of the contract according to the estimates, the association may pay to the contractor ninety-five percent of the amount retained from previous estimates. Any amount retained after ninety-five percent completion of the contract must be paid to the contractor in such amounts and at such times as are approved by the association, upon estimates by its agent, engineer, or architect or the contractor, with final payment of all moneys due to the contractor to be made immediately following completion and acceptance of the project. Immediately after considering and allowing any such estimate, the association shall certify and promptly draw a warrant upon the proper fund and transmit it to the contractor entitled to it. If the association fails or neglects to receive and allow the estimate or certify any estimate or final payment upon completion and acceptance for a period of more than thirty days from the date of the estimate or completion date, then the estimate or final payment, with any retainage properly payable, shall draw interest from its date at the rate per annum of two percentage points below the Bank of North Dakota prime interest rate as set thirty days from the date of the estimate or completion date until the issuance of a proper warrant therefor. Such interest must be computed and added to the face of the estimate, final payment, or retainage by the officer required to issue the warrant, must be included in the warrant when drawn, and must be charged to the fund from which payment for the improvement is to be made. On the amounts of estimates retained, as provided herein, the association may invest or deposit the retained amounts in the Bank of North Dakota earning interest or dividends for the benefit of the contractor. Any amount so invested or deposited must remain in the name of the association until final payment of all moneys due to the contractor is to be made. Further, no contractor shall use such account in any manner whatsoever until released and received by the contractor upon completion of the contract.

      The superintendent of the institution, the warden of the institution, the commanding general of the national guard, or the head of an agency, department, bureau, board, or commission, as the case may be, having the responsibility of supervising and maintaining a public building belonging to the state of North Dakota, may sell or remove such building whenever it is found to be obsolete, a fire hazard, in unsafe condition so as to constitute a hazard to life or limb, and is of no future use to the state where it is located, by obtaining the written approval of the state director of the office of management and budget if under the director’s supervision or the head of the department having supervision and the state fire marshal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economics shall dictate whether or not the sale or removal shall be by advertising for public bids and awarding same to the lowest responsible bidder. If the building is to be destroyed, every effort must be made to salvage and store any material which will be beneficial to the state or which will have a salable value.

     </p>
     <p>
      The compacting states hereby create the interstate industrialized or modular buildings commission, hereinafter called commission. Said commission shall be a body corporate of each compacting state and an agency thereof. The commission shall have all the powers and duties set forth herein and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       ARTICLE IV
       SELECTION OF COMMISSIONERS
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission shall be selected as follows. As each state becomes a compacting state, one resident shall be appointed as commissioner. The commissioner shall be selected by the governor of the compacting state, being designated from the state agency charged with regulating industrialized or modular buildings or, if such state agency does not exist, being designated from among those building officials with the most appropriate responsibilities in the state. The commissioner may designate another official as an alternate to act on behalf of the commissioner at commission meetings which the commissioner is unable to attend.
     </p>
     <p>
      Each state commissioner shall be appointed, suspended, or removed and shall serve subject to and in accordance with the laws of the state which said commissioner represents; and each vacancy occurring shall be filled in accordance with the laws of the state wherein the vacancy exists.
     </p>
     <p>
      When three state commissioners have been appointed in the manner described, those state commissioners shall select one additional commissioner who shall be a representative of manufacturers of industrial-use or commercial-use industrialized or modular buildings. When six state commissioners have been appointed in the manner described, the state commissioners shall select a second additional commissioner who shall be a representative of consumers of industrialized or modular buildings. With each addition of three state commissioners, the state commissioners shall appoint one additional representative commissioner, alternating between a representative of manufacturers of industrialized or modular buildings and consumers of industrialized or modular buildings. The ratio between state commissioners and representative commissioners shall be three to one. In the event states withdraw from the compact or, for any other reason, the number of state commissioners is reduced, the state commissioners shall remove the last added representative commissioner as necessary to maintain a ratio of state commissioners to representative commissioners of three to one.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon a majority vote of the state commissioners, the state commissioners may remove, fill a vacancy created by, or replace any representative commissioner, provided that any replacement is made from the same representative group and a three-to-one ratio is maintained. Unless provided otherwise, the representative commissioners have the same authority and responsibility as the state commissioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, the commission may have as a member one commissioner representing the United States government if federal law authorizes such representation. Such commissioner shall not vote on matters before the commission. Such commission shall be appointed by the President of the United States, or in such other manner as may be provided by Congress.

       </h5>
       <p>

   After a deputy warden’s initial suspension became final, there was no statutory support for subsequent review or further discipline. Although the director of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation may not have agreed with the state penitentiary warden’s disciplinary decision, the director delegated her authority to the warden, and the director did not have any authority to review the warden’s decision or to impose further discipline for the same conduct once the warden’s decision became final.

   Right to a hearing before a prison transfer, is “sufficiently embraced within Fourteenth Amendment ‘liberty’” to entitle a prisoner to minimum procedures ensuring that this right is not arbitrarily abrogated. In North Dakota, this statutorily created right exists only when the prisoner does not consent to the transfer. Having consented, prisoner had neither a statutory nor a constitutional right to a hearing. Former N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t54c54-21s54-21-25" target="_self">54-21-25</a></cite>.

The term does not mean a person who suffers bodily injury or death as a result of operating a motor vehicle, when, at the time of the injury or death, the person was not in compliance with applicable state laws and rules concerning motor vehicle insurance coverage and the person was at least partially at fault for causing the accident.

       Distribution of certain state publications for certain libraries required.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The office of management and budget shall arrange to deposit with the state library eight copies of all publications issued by all executive, legislative, and judicial agencies of state government intended for general public distribution. These publications must be provided to the state library without charge. If expense and limited supply of state publications, particularly audiovisual items, make compliance with the depository requirement impossible, the state library shall accept as many copies as an agency can afford to provide. However, each agency shall provide no less than two copies to the state library. State publications refer to any informational materials regardless of format, method of reproduction, or source, originating in or produced with the imprint of, by the authority of, or at the total or partial expense of, any state agency. The definition incorporates those publications that may or may not be financed by state funds but are released by private bodies such as research and consultant firms under contract with or supervision of any state agency. In circumstances not directly involving the office of management and budget, a state agency shall comply with the depository requirement by arranging with the necessary parties for the printing and deposit of eight copies of any state publication issued. State publications are specifically defined as public documents appearing as reports, directories, statistical compendiums, bibliographies, laws or bills, rules, regulations, newsletters, bulletins, state plans, brochures, periodicals, committee minutes, transcripts of public hearings, other printed matter, audiotapes, videotapes, films, filmstrips, or slides, but not those administrative or training materials used only within the issuing agency. As the document acquisition and distribution agency, the state library shall retain for its document collection two copies of every state document received and transmit the remaining copies to the depository libraries. These are the libraries of the state historical society, the university of North Dakota, North Dakota state university, library of Congress, and two others to be designated by the state library. All nondepository North Dakota libraries may receive state documents under an optional selection program developed by the state library. The state library shall catalog state publications and arrange for their conversion to microfilm or to optical disk storage prescribed by the state records administrator and shall make available for distribution the same to the designated depository libraries.

       POLICY AND PURPOSE
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis; and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states, and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.

      Every library agreement made pursuant to this compact must, prior to and as a condition precedent to its entry into force, be submitted to the attorney general of each state in which a public library agency party thereto is situated, who shall determine whether the agreement is in proper form and compatible with the laws of that state. The attorneys general shall approve any agreement submitted to them unless they shall find that it does not meet the conditions set forth herein and shall detail in writing addressed to the governing bodies of the public library agencies concerned the specific respects in which the proposed agreement fails to meet the requirements of law.

       Dissolution of the regional library cooperative.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the need for a regional library cooperative ceases to exist, the board of the cooperative, by a two-thirds vote of its members, may declare its intent to dissolve the organization and file with the North Dakota library coordinating council a plan for affecting the dissolution. Upon receipt of the dissolution plan, the council shall determine if the area of service can be allocated to other regional library cooperatives, determine whether the assets and liabilities of the regional library cooperative seeking to dissolve can be assumed and absorbed by adjoining regional library cooperatives, and consider any other factors that relate to the operation and functioning of the regional library cooperative seeking to dissolve. If the council determines that the regional library cooperative should be dissolved, the dissolution takes effect when all legal and fiscal obligations of the regional library cooperative have been satisfied.

   The law gives the state the right to money collected as fines and the county treasurer has an obligation to promptly remit such money, but there is no statutory authority for the collection of money from a county when the county court has not imposed a mandatory fine.

       <p>

   In order to prevail in a suit to recover fines alleged to have been improperly retained by a county, the state must establish a legal right to recover from the county. Because the state did not contest the county court’s jurisdiction over DUI proceedings or bond forfeitures, it was barred from collaterally attacking the county court judgments in an attempt to “correct” the court’s alleged improper designation of penalties as costs rather than fines. Because the state could not collaterally attack the judgments, any right in the money sought had to be established independent of the judgments. State ex rel. Rayl v. Hettinger County, 467 N.W.2d 98, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 1991).

   A county treasurer collecting state taxes acted merely as a person designated to make the collection, and not as an agent of either the state or county, and hence the county could not be required to answer for such funds collected on the theory of agency.

   Where state taxes were collected by a county treasurer and demand was duly made upon him for the same by the state officers authorized to receive them, he could not withhold such taxes and apply them in satisfaction of a claim of the county against the state for prior overpayments made to it.

No warrant upon the treasurer may be delivered or mailed to the payee or the payee’s agent or representative until the warrant has been signed by the treasurer and entered on the treasurer’s books as a check drawn on a bank depository. A record must be maintained specifying upon what fund or from what apportionment each warrant is to be paid. The state treasurer may redeem outstanding bonds or pay interest on bonds when due without the warrant of the office of management and budget, retaining the bond or interest coupon as a voucher for the payment until the next settlement.

       Highway tax distribution fund — State treasurer to make allocation to state, counties, and cities.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A highway tax distribution fund is created as a special fund in the state treasury into which must be deposited the moneys available by law from collections of motor vehicle registration and related fees, fuels taxes, special fuels taxes, use taxes, and special fuels excise taxes. The state treasurer shall transfer the first five million five hundred thousand dollars per biennium from the highway tax distribution fund to the state highway fund for the purpose of providing administrative assistance to other transferees. After the transfer of the first five million five hundred thousand dollars, any moneys in the highway tax distribution fund must be allocated and transferred monthly by the state treasurer, as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol11">
       Sixty-one and three-tenths percent must be transferred monthly to the state department of transportation and placed in a state highway fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol12">
       Two and seven-tenths percent must be transferred monthly to the township highway fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol13">
       One and five-tenths percent must be transferred monthly to the public transportation fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol14">
       Thirty-four and five-tenths percent must be allocated to the counties of this state in proportion to the number of vehicle registrations credited to each county. Each county must be credited with the certificates of title of vehicles registered by residents of the county. The state treasurer shall compute and distribute the counties’ share monthly after deducting the incorporated cities’ share. All the moneys received by the counties from the highway tax distribution fund must be set aside in a separate fund called the “highway tax distribution fund” and must be appropriated and applied solely for highway purposes in accordance with section 11 of article X of the Constitution of North Dakota. The state treasurer shall compute and distribute monthly the sums allocated to the incorporated cities within each county according to the formulas in this subsection using the incorporated cities’ populations as determined by the last official regular or special federal census or the census taken in accordance with the provisions of chapter 40-02 in case of a city incorporated subsequent to the census.
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol14a">
         For counties having no cities with a population of ten thousand or more, twenty-seven percent of the total county allocation must be distributed to all of the incorporated cities within the county on a countywide per capita basis. The remaining county allocation amount must be transferred into the county highway tax distribution fund.
        </li>
        <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol14b">
         For each county having a city with a population of ten thousand or more, the amount transferred each month into the county highway tax distribution fund must be the difference between the amount allocated to that county pursuant to this subsection and the total amount allocated and distributed to the incorporated cities in that county as computed according to the following formula:
         <ol>
          <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol14b1">
           A statewide per capita average as determined by calculating twenty-seven percent of the amount allocated to all of the counties under this subsection divided by the total population of all of the incorporated cities in the state.
          </li>
          <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol14b2">
           The share distributed to each city in the county having a population of less than one thousand must be determined by multiplying the population of that city by the product of 1.50 times the statewide per capita average computed under paragraph 1.
          </li>
          <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol14b3">
           The share distributed to each city in the county having a population of one thousand to four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine, inclusive, must be determined by multiplying the population of that city by the product of 1.25 times the statewide per capita average computed under paragraph 1.
          </li>
          <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol14b4">
           The share distributed to each city in the county having a population of five thousand or more must be determined by multiplying the population of that city by the statewide per capita average for all such cities, which per capita average must be computed as follows: the total of the shares computed under paragraphs 2 and 3 for all cities in the state having a population of less than five thousand must be subtracted from the total incorporated cities’ share in the state as computed under paragraph 1 and the balance remaining must then be divided by the total population of all cities of five thousand or more in the state.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-27s54-27-19ol15">
       The moneys allocated to the incorporated cities must be distributed to them monthly by the state treasurer and must be deposited by the cities in a separate fund and may only be used in accordance with section 11 of article X of the Constitution of North Dakota and an incorporated city may use the fund for the construction, reconstruction, repair, and maintenance of public highways within or outside the city pursuant to an agreement entered into between the city and any other political subdivision as authorized by section 54-40-08.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state treasurer shall no less than quarterly allocate and distribute all moneys in the township highway aid fund to the counties of the state based on the length of township roads in each county compared to the length of all township roads in the state. To receive any funds under this section, organized townships must provide fifty percent matching funds. The county treasurer shall allocate the funds received to the organized townships in the county which provide fifty percent matching funds based on the length of township roads in each of those organized townships compared to the length of all township roads in the county. The funds received must be deposited in the township road and bridge fund and used for highway and bridge purposes. If a county does not have organized townships, or has some organized and some unorganized townships, the county shall retain a pro rata portion of the funds received based on the length of roads in unorganized townships compared to the length of township roads in organized townships in the county. Moneys retained by a county for the benefit of unorganized townships under this section must be deposited in the county road and bridge fund. Moneys retained by the county treasurer due to the failure of organized townships to provide required matching funds must be returned to the state treasurer who shall deposit the funds in the highway tax distribution fund. The board of county commissioners shall certify to the state treasurer any change in township road mileage when a change occurs and shall, by July first of each even-numbered year, certify the total number of township road mileage in each of the county’s organized and unorganized townships. The state treasurer shall prescribe the form and manner by which the certification is made.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to effectively meet the cyclical cash flow needs of state government, the office of management and budget upon approval of the emergency commission is hereby authorized to issue certificates in anticipation of revenue, notes, or bonds, to special funds on deposit in the state treasury. Any issue of such certificates, notes, or bonds must be approved by the emergency commission and are to be used for cash flow financing only, and not to offset projected deficits in state finances unless first approved by the legislative assembly or the budget section if the legislative assembly is not in session. The budget section may approve additional cash flow financing not to exceed eighty percent of estimated general fund revenues relating to sales or production occurring prior to June thirtieth, to be collected in July and August after the end of the biennium. Such additional cash flow financing is only effective for sixty days unless an extension or reapproval is received from the legislative assembly or the budget section if the legislative assembly is not in session. Any request considered by the budget section must comply with section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t54c54-35s54-35-02.9" target="_self">54-35-02.9</a></cite>. If a revenue shortfall of greater than five percent occurs, the office of management and budget shall order budget allotments under section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t54c54-44.1s54-44.1-12" target="_self">54-44.1-12</a></cite> prior to approval by the legislative assembly or the budget section of such additional cash flow financing. It is the intent of the legislative assembly that all borrowing must be repaid by the end of the biennium. The terms of any specific issue of such certificates, notes, or bonds may not exceed one hundred eighty days from the date of issuance whereupon the principal and interest on the certificates, notes, or bonds must be paid in full from the state general fund or from another issue of a similar nature. All principal and interest on such issues made during a biennial period must be repaid in full at the close of the biennial period from the state general fund. When certificates, notes, or bonds are issued for cash flow purposes to funds which otherwise would be invested, with the investment income accruing to the special fund, the certificate must bear an investment rate of return which must be agreed upon by the state investment board, and must be at a level commensurate with the yield to be reasonably expected by such fund if invested in alternate securities.

      The budget stabilization fund is a special fund in the state treasury. The state investment board shall supervise investment of the budget stabilization fund in accordance with chapter 21-10. Any interest or other budget stabilization fund earnings must be credited to the fund. Any amounts provided by law for deposit in the fund and any interest or earnings of the fund which would bring the balance in the fund at the end of any fiscal year to an amount greater than fifteen percent of the current biennial state general fund budget, as finally approved by the most recently adjourned special or regular session of the legislative assembly, may not be deposited in or credited to the fund but must be deposited instead in the state general fund.

      An issue of bonds of the state of North Dakota, to be known as “bonds of North Dakota, real estate series”, is authorized and directed under the conditions and in the manner and for the purposes set forth in this chapter. Such issue of bonds is authorized for the purpose of making delivery thereof to the industrial commission of North Dakota, as provided in this chapter, to the end that the commission, by negotiation and sale of the bonds, may procure necessary funds for the Bank of North Dakota, thus replacing in the Bank the funds employed by it from time to time in making loans upon first mortgages of real estate.

     <p>
      Whenever first mortgages upon real estate are held by the Bank of North Dakota securing a total amount of unpaid mortgage loans in the sum of at least one hundred thousand dollars, the industrial commission may cause such mortgages, or such of them as it shall think proper, but not less than the total amount of one hundred thousand dollars, to be assigned, together with the obligations thereby secured, to the state treasurer. The assignment of each such mortgage and obligation must be executed by the president of the Bank of North Dakota and must recite that it is made to “The state treasurer of North Dakota, and successors in office in trust, as security for bonds to be issued under the designation of bonds of North Dakota, real estate series, as provided by law”. The assignment must be duly recorded by the president in each county in which the lands affected by the mortgage are situated. As soon as such assignments are recorded, they, with the instruments assigned, must be delivered to the state treasurer, and at the same time the president of the Bank shall deliver to the state treasurer a verified statement showing the principal amount remaining unpaid on each such obligation secured by the mortgages so delivered.

Const. Art. X, § 18 against gifts of public funds. Moreover, the public purpose component of N.D. Const. Art. X, § 18 and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment were satisfied because economic development programs promote the prosperity and general welfare of the people within a governmental entity.

       The North Dakota legislative management consists of the majority and minority leaders of the house and of the senate, the speaker of the house, and six senators and six representatives chosen biennially before the close of each regular legislative session.

      <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-01ol12">
       In the house of representatives the majority leader shall appoint to the legislative management members elected by the political party with the largest number of members in the house and the minority leader of the house shall appoint to the legislative management members elected by the political party with the next largest number of members in the house. The majority and minority leaders of the house of representatives shall make the appointments so as to give the two political parties having the most members in the house the same total proportionate representation on the legislative management as prevails in the house. In allocating the membership on the legislative management to each political party, the total number of members in the house of representatives must be divided by six; the resulting quotient must then be divided into the number of members of each of the two political parties of the house; the resulting quotient for each party of the house, rounded to the nearest whole number, is the number of members of that political party in the house to be on the legislative management. Notwithstanding this allocation, the minority political party in the house of representatives must be represented by at least two members on the legislative management.

       Any vacancy occurring when the legislative assembly is not in session must be filled by the selection of another member of the legislative assembly belonging to the same party as the member originally appointed, the selection to be made by the remaining senate or house members of the legislative management, depending upon which body has the vacancy. Each senator and each representative chosen to serve on the legislative management shall serve until a new legislative management has been selected at the next regular legislative session; provided, however, that no senator, not a holdover, who is not re-elected to the senate, and no representative, who is not re-elected to the house of representatives, may serve as a member of the legislative management beyond the closing day of the term to which elected. Any vacancy occurring because any member of the legislative management is not re-elected must be filled for the period from the beginning of the session until a new legislative management is selected, in the same manner as the original legislative management is selected.

      The legislative audit and fiscal review committee shall study and review audit reports as selected by the committee from those submitted by the state auditor, confer with the auditor and deputy auditors in regard to such reports, and when necessary, confer with representatives of the department, agency, or institution audited in order to obtain full and complete information in regard to any and all fiscal transactions and governmental operations of any department, agency, or institution of the state. The committee shall meet at least once each calendar quarter during each interim. Each department, agency, or institution shall furnish to the committee such aid, information, and assistance in regard to fiscal transactions and governmental operations as it may from time to time request. Whenever the committee may determine or have reason to believe that there may have been a violation of law relating to the receipt, custody, or expenditure of public funds by any state officer or employee, the committee shall present such evidence or information as may be in its possession to the attorney general. The attorney general shall receive and accept such evidence or information and shall immediately commence such additional investigation as the attorney general determines necessary. Upon completion of the investigation, if the evidence supplied by the committee and through the investigation indicates the probability of a violation of law by any state official or employee, the attorney general immediately shall prosecute such official or employee as provided by law. Whenever the committee may determine that a state agency, department, or institution has failed to correct an audit finding within two bienniums which the committee determines critically important, the committee may recommend the legislative assembly reduce the state agency, department, or institution’s appropriation as compared with the amount appropriated to the agency, department, or institution for the previous biennium. The legislative management, through its committee on legislative audit and fiscal review, or such persons as may be directed or employed by the legislative council, is authorized, within the limits of legislative appropriations, to make such audits, examinations, or studies of the fiscal transactions or governmental operations of departments, agencies, or institutions of the state as the legislative management may determine necessary.

       Legislative interim committee review of economic development tax incentives.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly enacts economic development tax incentives with the intent to encourage businesses to locate, grow, and remain in the state; to enhance employment opportunities for citizens; and to foster the most advantageous direction, diversity, and growth of the state economy. The legislative assembly requires systematic, detailed analysis of enacted economic development tax incentives to assure that incentives are, and will continue, serving the intended purposes in a cost-effective and equitable manner consistent with the intent of the legislative assembly. To serve this intent and requirement:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol11">
       During each interim, the legislative management shall assign to a legislative management interim committee study responsibility that includes completing the analysis of economic development tax incentives as provided in this section and reporting its findings and any associated recommended legislation to the legislative management.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12">
       The legislative management interim committee assigned the study responsibility under this section shall analyze each incentive, applying considerations relevant to the perceived goals of the incentive, including any or all of the following:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12a">
         The extent of achievement of the goals of the incentive and whether unintended consequences have developed in its application.
        </li>
        <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12b">
         Whether the design and application of the incentive can be improved.
        </li>
        <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12c">
         The extent of complementary or duplicative effect of other incentives or governmental programs.
        </li>
        <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12d">
         Whether the incentive has a positive influence on business behavior or rewards business behavior that is likely to have occurred without the incentive.

        <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12e">
         The effect of the incentive on the state economy, including the extent of primary sector operation of the recipient and any competitive disadvantage imposed or benefit conferred on other state businesses, any benefit or burden created for local government, and the extent of the incentive’s benefit that flows to out-of-state concerns.
        </li>
        <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12f">
         The employment opportunities generated by the incentive and the extent those represent career opportunities.
        </li>
        <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12g">
         Whether the incentive is the most effective use of state resources to achieve desired goals.
        </li>
        <li id="t54c54-35s54-35-26ol12h">
         If the committee’s analysis of the incentive is constrained by lack of data, whether statutory or administrative changes should be made to improve collection and availability of data.

       Disbursement of funds — Issuance of bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The parties to such agreement may provide for disbursements from public funds, including funds already raised to buy real estate for public buildings, proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to chapter 21-03, and other proper funds or properties already on hand, to carry out the purposes of the agreement. The total amount of bonds issued by a county and a city under this section must be in proportion to the joint usage of the building by the county and the city and must also consider the tax base of the county and the tax base of the city. When a county and a city wholly within the county boundaries propose to issue bonds for the purpose of a building for their joint use, the governing body of the county may submit to its qualified voters the proposition of issuing bonds in the total amount required to be borrowed for the building, under an initial resolution and ballot stating the maximum total principal amount of the bonds and the maximum principal amount thereof for which the city shall be obligated. In this event the governing body of the city shall adopt an ordinance or resolution stating the maximum amount of the obligation proposed to be incurred by the city and the other matters of information required for an initial resolution for bonds under the provisions of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.21.html#t21c21-03s21-03-09" target="_blank">21-03-09</a></cite>, which ordinance or resolution shall be subject to referral to the qualified electors of the city by petition of the percentage of the qualified electors referred to in chapter 40-12 and upon the conditions and in the manner therein set forth. If the issuance of the bonds is approved by the required majority of the qualified electors of the county voting thereon, and if the city ordinance or resolution is not referred or is approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the city voting thereon, the bonds may be issued by the county and the obligation incurred by the city. The principal amount of the obligation incurred by the city to the county, as provided in the agreement, must be a general obligation and indebtedness of the city as referred to and limited by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.21.html#t21c21-03s21-03-04" target="_blank">21-03-04</a></cite> and by section 15 of article X of the Constitution of North Dakota, and must be deducted from the principal amount of the bonds in determining the net indebtedness incurred by the county in the issuance thereof. The city shall levy a direct, annual, irrepealable tax for the payment of its obligation and the interest thereon as required for the payment of general obligation bonds under the provisions of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.21.html#t21c21-03s21-03-15" target="_blank">21-03-15</a></cite>, which tax must be retained by the county auditor in the sinking and interest fund for the county bonds as provided in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.21.html#t21c21-03s21-03-41" target="_blank">21-03-41</a></cite>. Each payment of principal, interest, and premium, if any, due with respect to the county bonds must be the obligation of the city in the proportion that the original principal amount of the city’s obligation bears to the original principal amount of the bonds, for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of net indebtedness of the city and the county outstanding at any time, of determining the amounts of taxes required to be assessed and collected annually by the city and the county for the bond sinking and interest fund, and of determining the amounts of income from the investment of the sinking and interest fund which are to be credited against the obligations of the city and county, respectively, and for all other purposes whatsoever. Nothing herein requires the city-county agreement to be executed before the authorization of the bonds and the city’s obligation thereon. The agreement when executed must fix the relative contributions of the city and county to the capital cost of the building in a manner consistent with the maximum net indebtedness authorized to be incurred by each of them, respectively. If so provided in the agreement, the city may evidence its obligation by the issuance of general obligation bonds of the city and appropriate the proceeds of its bonds for expenditure in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and the amount of the county bonds may be reduced by the amount issued by the city. Funds other than taxes for debt service may be paid to and disbursed by such agency as may be agreed upon, but the method of disbursement must agree as far as practicable with the method provided by law for the disbursement of funds by the parties to the agreement. Strict accountability of all funds and report of all receipts and disbursements must be provided for.

       Legislative findings and purpose.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds that the citizens of the state have a fundamental interest in the orderly development of the state and its resources. This finding recognizes the fact that the mobility of the population, changes in economic forces, and governmental mandates within and without the state present problems that cannot always be met by individual counties or cities and that local government planning and development efforts can be strengthened when aided by studies, planning, and implementation of both a statewide and regional character.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly further finds that the state has a positive interest in the establishment, preparation, and maintenance of a long-term, continuing, comprehensive planning and development process for the physical, social, and economic development of the state and each of its regions to serve as a guide for activities of state and local governmental units.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is the purpose of this chapter to establish a consistent, comprehensive statewide policy for planning, economic development, program operations, coordination, and related cooperative activities of state and local governmental units and to enhance the ability of and opportunity for local governmental units to resolve issues and problems transcending their individual boundaries. In furtherance of this purpose, the legislative assembly finds that the governor is required to assure orderly and harmonious coordination of state and local plans and programs with federal, state, and regional planning and programming.

      As a condition precedent to an agreement made under this chapter becoming effective, it must have the approval of the governor of North Dakota and the governing bodies of the tribes involved. If the agreement is a tax collection agreement between the tax commissioner and one or more tribes, the agreement also is subject to confirmation by a majority of members elected to the house of representatives and the senate and does not become effective until its legislative confirmation date or the effective date in the agreement, whichever is later. Each tax collection agreement presented for legislative confirmation must contain an expiration date not more than sixteen years after its effective date and the expiration date must be March thirty-first of an odd-numbered year. If the agreement obtains the approvals under this section and, if required, legislative confirmation under this section, it may be submitted to the secretary for approval.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The colors of yellow gold and green are indicative of the great agricultural state of North Dakota and has particular reference to ripening grain and the abundant grazing areas. The Indian arrowhead forms the shield of the coat of arms and symbolizes the “Sioux State”. The three stars denote the trinity of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. Each star in the bend is given the heraldic value of thirteen which signifies the thirteen original colonies of the United States, and the cumulative numerical value of the three stars indicates that North Dakota was the thirty-ninth state admitted to the Union. The stars also allude to the history of the territory under three foreign flags. Three stars are borne upon the coat of arms of Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark expedition and also on the coat of arms of Lord Selkirk, head of the first permanent settlement in this state. The fleur-de-lis alludes to LaVerendrye, a French explorer who was the first known white man to visit the territory of this state. The blue and gold wreath in the crest reflects the history of the territory as part of the Louisiana purchase. The crest which shall constitute the military crest of the state of North Dakota is a motif taken from the state seal and to the Sioux Indian tribes signifies mighty warriors.

        Constitutionality of Education Funding.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>

   Although no one of the various statutes for distributing funding for primary or secondary education, by itself, is unconstitutional, nor does the constitution require equal dollar funding per pupil throughout the state, the impact of the distribution of funding does not bear a close correspondence to the goals of providing an equal educational opportunity and of supporting elementary and secondary education from state funds based on educational costs per pupil; therefore, the overall impact of the entire statutory method for distributing funding for education in North Dakota is unconstitutional.

The lien has priority over all other liens and encumbrances acquired after the date the institution was notified of the required reimbursement by the office of management and budget.

      State institutions may work with local communities and stakeholders to develop proposed property or institution alternative use plans, including partnerships with private industry and not-for-profit organizations, to be reviewed by the office of management and budget. In accordance with the provisions of the community and institution approved plan, the office of management and budget shall introduce any statutory and constitutional changes necessary to implement the plan and request funding for the grant under this section for consideration by the legislative assembly. Subject to approval of all necessary statutory and constitutional changes and necessary legislative appropriations, the office of management and budget shall provide a grant up to the present value of the total estimated savings to the state for the next ten years resulting from converting the property or institution to an alternative use. The office of management and budget shall consider the estimated cost to the state of continuing to provide the service of the institution or property to state residents when calculating the estimated savings to the state. The office of management and budget shall use the rate of interest earned on state funds deposited at the Bank of North Dakota for calculating the present value of the estimated savings to the state. The grant is to assist the institution and community in the transition to an alternative use.

       Budget estimates of budget units filed with the office of the budget — Deadline.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The head of each budget unit, not later than July fifteenth of each year next preceding the session of the legislative assembly, shall submit to the office of the budget, estimates of financial requirements of the person’s budget unit for the next two fiscal years, on the forms and in the manner prescribed by the office of the budget, with such explanatory data as is required by the office of the budget and such additional data as the head of the budget unit wishes to submit. The estimates of financial requirements for budget units under the control of the state board of higher education must be made using the same forms, supporting information, and documentation as other budget units. Any request for a new full-time or part-time permanent position included in a budget unit’s estimate of its financial requirements for the next two fiscal years must include documentation justifying the need for the position. The documentation must describe the circumstances resulting in the need for the position and identify the number of hours the position will be involved in specific types of activities and the anticipated outcomes of the activities. The estimates so submitted must bear the approval of the board or commission of each budget unit for which a board or commission is constituted. The director of the budget may extend the filing date for any budget unit if the director finds there is some circumstance that makes it advantageous to authorize the extension. If a budget unit has not submitted its estimate of financial requirements by the required date or within a period of extension set by the director of the budget, the director of the budget shall prepare the budget unit’s estimate of financial requirements except the estimate may not exceed ninety percent of the budget unit’s previous biennial appropriation. The director of the budget or a subordinate officer as the director shall designate shall examine the estimates and shall afford to the heads of budget units reasonable opportunity for explanation in regard thereto and, when requested, shall grant to the heads of budget units a hearing thereon which must be open to the public.

   Any time an allotment is made reducing agency budgets, the actual availability of additional revenues will not be discerned until very late in the biennium, and there is a strong probability that the biennium will end, the thirty-day period specified in this section will run, and the appropriation will lapse and be canceled before a legal challenge in the courts can work its way through the trial and appellate court processes; accordingly, because the inherent nature of the appropriation and allotment process set forth in this chapter virtually assures repetition of this issue without a meaningful opportunity for judicial review, an appeal based upon the failure to transfer funds to meet certain appropriations will not be rendered moot simply because the appropriation had lapsed and been canceled.

      The general purpose of this chapter is to create North Dakota human resource management services in order to establish a unified system of human resource management for the classified service of the state based upon merit principles and scientific methods, governing the position classification, pay administration, and transfer of its employees. All appointments and promotions to positions in the state classified service must be made without regard to sex, race, color, national origin, age, religious affiliations, or political opinions on the basis of merit and fitness.

       Compensation philosophy statement.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The compensation program for classified state employees must be designed to recruit, retain, and motivate a quality workforce for the purpose of providing efficient and effective services to the citizens of North Dakota. For purposes of this section, “compensation” is defined as base salary and related fringe benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      The compensation program must:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54c54-44.3s54-44.3-01.2ol11">
       Provide a competitive employee compensation package based on job content evaluation, internal equity, and external competitiveness balanced by the state’s fiscal conditions.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-44.3s54-44.3-01.2ol12">
       Be based on principles of fairness and equity.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-44.3s54-44.3-01.2ol13">
       Include a consistent compensation policy which allows for multiple pay structures to address varying occupational specialties.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-44.3s54-44.3-01.2ol14">
       Set the external competitiveness target for salary range midpoints at a competitive level of relevant labor markets. For purposes of this section, “relevant labor markets” is defined as the labor markets from which the state attracts employees in similar positions and the labor markets to which the state loses employees in similar positions.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-44.3s54-44.3-01.2ol15">
       Include a process for providing compensation adjustments that considers a combination of factors, including achievement of performance objectives or results, competency determinations, recognition of changes in job content, and acquisition and application of advanced skills or knowledge.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-44.3s54-44.3-01.2ol16">
       Provide funding for compensation adjustments based on the dollar amounts determined necessary to provide competitive compensation in accordance with the state’s compensation philosophy. Funding for compensation adjustments may not be provided as a statewide percentage increase attributable to all employees nor as part of a statewide pool of funds designated for addressing equity issues.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-44.3s54-44.3-01.2ol17">
       Consider the needs of the state as an employer and the tax effect on North Dakota citizens.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The office of management and budget shall develop and consistently administer the compensation program for classified state employees and ensure that state agencies adhere to the components of the state’s compensation philosophy. The office of management and budget shall regularly conduct compensation comparisons to ensure that the state’s compensation levels are competitive with relevant labor markets. Any salary information collected from private businesses for the purpose of conducting compensation comparisons is exempt from public disclosure. Records naming private businesses from which salary information is collected are open.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly recognizes the importance of providing annual compensation adjustments to employees based on performance and equity to maintain the market competitiveness of the compensation system.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the intent of the state of North Dakota to assure fair and equitable treatment and promote harmony between and among all classified employees by requiring affected agencies to adopt grievance procedures and through the creation of a statewide appeals mechanism with primary jurisdiction to entertain and resolve classified employee appeals. It is the policy of this state to resolve bona fide employee complaints as quickly as possible. The division shall cooperate with and assist the various departments, agencies, and institutions of the state in the development and implementation of basic agency grievance procedures and a statewide appeal mechanism. The division shall certify appeals from nonprobationary employees in the classified service which are related to discrimination, merit system qualification, reprisals, reduction in force, forced relocation, demotion with loss of pay, suspension without pay, and dismissal, and from applicants for positions in the classified service and probationary employees in the classified service which are related to discrimination or reprisal. Upon receipt of an appeal, the division shall submit a written request to the director of the office of administrative hearings to designate an administrative law judge for the division to conduct the hearing and related proceedings, including receiving evidence and preparing findings of fact, conclusions of law, and issuing a final decision. The moving party in the initial action bears the burden of proof in the appeal. An appeal to the district court from the determination of the administrative law judge must be filed according to chapter 28-32, including proper service upon the division, but neither the division nor the office of administrative hearings may be named as a party to the appeal under chapter 28-32 unless an employee of one of those two agencies is involved in the grievance.

      It is state policy to provide comprehensive purchasing services based upon sound procurement practices and principles wherein, through full competition with fair and equal opportunity to all qualified persons to sell to the state, each state agency and institution shall obtain its necessary commodities and services at competitive cost, consistent with quality, time, and performance requirements, except as otherwise provided by law. As used in this chapter, unless the context requires otherwise:

      The office of management and budget shall develop guidelines for a person interested in conducting business with the state. The guidelines must address communications between interested persons and purchasing agencies before, during, and after the procurement process. Procurements conducted by the office of management and budget or a purchasing agency must have a procurement officer who serves as the point of contact for all correspondence related to the procurement. A person that is interested in submitting a bid or has submitted a bid or proposal to provide commodities or services to the state in response to an active procurement should ensure all communications related to the procurement are only with the designated point of contact. This section does not restrict an interested person’s communication with state officials or any member of the legislative assembly unless the state official or member of the legislative assembly is involved directly with the procurement for which the person is interested or has submitted a bid or proposal.

Every person that desires to bid or submit a proposal on contracts for commodities or services awarded under this chapter must be an approved vendor in order to be placed on the bidders list. The office of management and budget or the purchasing agency shall use the list when issuing invitation for bids or request for proposals over the amount established for small purchases, except as otherwise provided in this section. The office of management and budget or the purchasing agency shall use the list when sending notice of intent to make cooperative, limited competitive, noncompetitive, and negotiated purchases.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-44.4s54-44.4-09ol12">
       To become an approved vendor a person shall file an application with the office of management and budget. The application must contain information requested by the office of management and budget, including business and persons’ names, telephone numbers, addresses, federal tax identification numbers, type of business organization, the types of commodities or services for which the applicant is interested in receiving solicitations, and other business information the office of management and budget determines relevant. The application must also contain a statement appointing the secretary of state as the applicant’s agent for service of process pursuant to subsection 3. The application must be signed and certified by an owner, partner, or company officer authorized by company bylaws or other organizational document to bind the company. The signature requirement may include the use of an electronic signature as defined in section 9-16-01 when authorized under section 9-16-17. The office of management and budget may require proof of the signing person’s authority by certified copy of appropriate company documents.

       At the time of filing the application to become an approved vendor, the applicant, if organized as a corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or limited partnership, must be properly and currently registered with the secretary of state according to its type of business organization as a corporation under chapter 10-19.1, a limited liability company under chapter 10-32.1, a limited liability partnership under chapter 45-22, or a limited partnership under chapter 45-10.2. Any exemptions to registration under the above chapters that would otherwise apply to those entities organized as such do not apply to this section and registration must be made for the applicant to become an approved vendor. Applicants for approved vendor status using a trade name or a fictitious partnership name must be in full compliance with chapter 47-25 or 45-11 at the time of making the application. Whenever any registration required by this section is canceled, revoked, or not renewed, the vendor ceases to be an approved vendor.

       The procurement officer may authorize receipt of a bid or proposal from a vendor that is not on the list of approved vendors if the procurement officer makes a written determination that it is in the best interest of the state to receive the bid or proposal. The successful bidder or offeror must become approved before the award and the existence of this approval requirement must be stated in the solicitation. If an unapproved vendor is selected for award, the vendor’s bid or proposal may be rejected if that vendor fails to become approved within sixty days or within a shorter period as specified in writing by the procurement officer. Before issuing a solicitation, the procurement officer may waive the approval requirement if the procurement officer determines, in consultation with the secretary of state, that registration with the secretary of state and appointment of an agent for service of process in this state are not required. The waiver of the approval requirement must be stated in the solicitation. In the event that two or more bids contain identical pricing or receive identical evaluation scores, preference must be given pursuant to section 44-08-01.1. If the application of section 44-08-01.1 does not result in the award of a contract, preference must be given to bids submitted by vendors approved under this section.
      </li>

     <p>
      By signing and filing the application, the vendor applicant appoints the secretary of state as its true and lawful agent for service of process in this state upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action or proceeding against the vendor if the vendor or its registered agent cannot be found for service of process in this state. The signed application is written evidence of the applicant’s consent that any process served against the applicant that is so served upon the secretary of state is of the same legal force and effect as if served upon the applicant personally within this state. Within ten days after service of the summons upon the secretary of state pursuant to this subsection, notice of the service with the summons and complaint in the action must be sent to the defendant vendor at the vendor’s last-known address by certified mail with return receipt requested and proof of mailing must be attached to the summons. The secretary of state shall keep a record of all process served upon the secretary of state under this section showing the day and hour of service. When service of process is made as provided in this subsection, the court, before entering a default judgment, or at any stage of the proceeding, may order a continuance as may be necessary to afford the defendant vendor reasonable opportunity to defend any action pending against the vendor.

       State facility energy improvement program.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      By August fifteenth of each odd-numbered year, the office shall inform all state agencies and institutions of the state facility energy improvement program. The office shall work with interested agencies and institutions to identify potential state facility energy improvement programs and select facilities for indepth energy audits designed to provide information on project costs along with estimated energy savings from implementation of those projects. The office shall notify affected utilities to discuss the potential impact on the utility and its customers of the proposed energy savings or conservation project. Upon completion of the energy audit, the office, in consultation with the interested agencies or institutions, shall submit a list of proposed projects to the governor, accompanied with the estimated cost of each project and energy savings resulting from the projects. The office shall submit a report listing the proposed energy savings or conservation projects to the governor by September first of each even-numbered year. The governor shall include the proposed energy efficiency or conservation projects in the biennial budget. The governor shall make available to the legislative assembly a report prepared by the office on each energy efficiency or conservation project, a description of the improvements to be financed, the estimated cost of each project, the total cost of the program, and the proposed method of financing the program. If the office proposes that evidences of indebtedness be issued to finance the energy efficiency or conservation improvements, the office shall provide an assurance that energy savings resulting from the improvements will be sufficient to equal or exceed the annual debt service of the evidences of indebtedness. In determining whether the energy savings will be sufficient to equal or exceed the annual debt service, the office, in consultation with the interested agencies or institutions, may analyze state agency utility data to identify potential projects; perform detailed energy audits of state facilities, including contracting for audits if necessary; and provide training to facility maintenance staff to ensure that sufficient cost-savings are realized from projects to cover the debt service. The governor shall include in the executive budget recommendation for each state agency or institution participating in the state facility energy improvement program an estimate of the annual energy cost-savings expected for that agency, and, if needed, a projection of the debt service on program bonds that is apportioned to that agency. The executive budget recommendation must then reduce the current level of utility appropriations by the amount needed for debt service retirement and recommend an appropriation of that amount to the state building authority. Any appropriation of an amount needed for debt service retirement to the state building authority is not subject to the limitation contained in section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t54c54-17.2s54-17.2-23" target="_self">54-17.2-23</a></cite>.

     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds and declares that there is a need to minimize the governmental paperwork burden for state and local government entities, individuals, businesses, and others; that the costs of collecting, maintaining, using, and disseminating information are constantly escalating due to the increasingly voluminous and complex nature of state statutes and regulations; that there is a need to coordinate, integrate, and to the extent practicable and appropriate, make uniform the information policies and practices in North Dakota; and that the governmental paperwork burden can best be eased by establishing a statewide forms management program within the information technology department.

   Finding that the documents that the board received in response to discovery requested in an administrative proceeding fell within provisions dealing with government records was proper because gathering information was a step in the decision making process and was considered public business. It was undisputed the board received the documents through discovery procedures in an administrative proceeding that the board had authority to conduct. Energy Transfer LP v. N.D.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The state records administrator shall establish and maintain a central microfilm unit and microfilm any record of any state office, agency, or department in either the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of state government, if the administrator determines the cost of the microfilming is reasonable in relation to the record’s historical significance or the frequency and type of use of the record. If the administrator and the office of management and budget determine that the services called for in this chapter can be provided more efficiently and economically through contracting with private contractors, the administrator may enter into such contracts or require an agency to use the services of a contractor as allowed by section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t54c54-46.1s54-46.1-05" target="_self">54-46.1-05</a></cite>. Release of records to a contractor for microfilming under this section or section <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t54c54-46.1s54-46.1-05" target="_self">54-46.1-05</a></cite> is not a violation of section <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.12.1.html#t12c12.1-01c12.1-13s12.1-13-01" target="_blank">12.1-13-01</a></cite>, <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t54c54-46.1s54-46.1-07" target="_self">54-46.1-07</a></cite>, or any other law that provides for any civil or criminal penalty for the release of certain records. A contractor hired by the administrator under this section or by an agency under section 54-46.1-05 may not disclose any information from any record, disclose any record the contractor receives for microfilming services, or make or retain a copy or other reproduction of a record not required by the contract to be made. Any contractor hired by the administrator under this section or by an agency under section 54-46.1-05 is subject to the penalties provided by law for unauthorized release of public records, and the contractor must agree to fully comply with all applicable state or federal laws or rules prohibiting release of public records. Each office, agency, and department shall reimburse the central microfilm unit for the actual costs incurred in microfilming its records. The administrator shall deposit moneys received under this section in the information technology operating account. The administrator shall employ professional, technical, and clerical personnel as the administrator determines to be necessary to carry out the duties prescribed in this chapter and, within the limits of the legislative appropriation, shall fix the salaries of all employees within the central microfilm unit. All personnel within the central microfilm unit must be allowed their actual and necessary travel expenses at the same rate as for other employees of the state. The administrator may perform microfilm services for any state institution and for any county, when the institution or county requests such services and the administrator agrees that the request is consistent with good records management practices.

      Any public entity may adopt and use an optical data storage process for the storage of records by optical disk mediums when the use of the process is consistent with good records management practices. The state records administrator may prescribe such practices, except for specialized commercial databases such as those used in libraries. As used in this chapter, an optical data storage process includes the optical disk software and hardware used in that process and the records stored by that process after the entity involved has established a records management program with respect to optical data storage.

Except as otherwise provided by law, every other eligible governmental unit employee of a participating governmental unit is a participating member in the plan and must be enrolled in the plan within the first month of employment. An employee who was not enrolled in the retirement system when eligible to participate must be enrolled immediately upon notice of the employee’s eligibility, unless the employee waives in writing the employee’s right to participate for the previous time of eligibility, to avoid contributing to the fund for past service. An employee who is eligible for normal retirement who accepts a retirement benefit under this chapter and who subsequently becomes employed with a participating employer other than the employer with which the employee was employed at the time the employee retired under this chapter may, before being re-enrolled in the retirement plan within the first month of employment, elect to permanently waive future participation in the retirement plan and the retiree health program and maintain that employee’s retirement status.

      Participating members shall receive benefits according to this section and according to rules adopted by the board, not inconsistent with this chapter. No person is entitled to receive a prior service benefit if the person was not continuously employed by a governmental unit in North Dakota for a period of not less than two years immediately prior to eligibility for retirement.

       Participating members shall receive credit for full-time employment or its equivalent from the date they attain eligibility until their normal retirement date, postponed retirement date, or early retirement date, as defined in this section. Part-time employment will be recognized as full-time employment on a prorated basis as the board may prescribe.

       Retirement benefits are calculated from the participating member’s final average salary, which is the average of the highest salary received by the member for any thirty-six months employed during the last one hundred twenty months of employment. For members who terminate employment on or after August 1, 2010, final average salary is the average of the highest salary received by the member for any thirty-six months employed during the last one hundred eighty months of employment. For members who terminate employment between July 31, 2005, and August 1, 2010, final average salary is the average of the highest salary received by the member for any thirty-six months employed during the period for which the board has appropriate and accurate salary records on the board’s electronic database, but that period may not be more than the last one hundred eighty months of employment. For members who terminate employment after December 31, 2019, final average salary is the higher of the final average salary calculated on December 31, 2019, or the average salary earned in the three highest periods of twelve consecutive months employed during the last one hundred eighty months of employment. Months without earnings are excluded for the purpose of computing an average. If the participating member has worked for less than thirty-six months at the normal retirement date, the final average salary is the average salary for the total months of employment.

       Military service under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act — Member retirement credit.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A member re-employed under the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994, as amended [Pub. L. 103-353; 108 Stat. 3150; 38 U.S.C. 4301-4333], is entitled to receive retirement credit for the period of qualified military service. The required contribution for the credit, including payment for retiree health benefits, must be made in the same manner and by the same party as would have been made had the employee been continuously employed. If the salary the member would have received during the period of service is not reasonably certain, the member’s average rate of compensation during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the member’s period of service or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding that period, times the number of months of credit being purchased must be used. Employees must be allowed up to three times the period of military service or five years, whichever is less, to make any required payments. This provision applies to all qualifying periods of military service since October 1, 1994. Effective for years after December 31, 2008, compensation for purposes of Internal Revenue Code section 415 [26 U.S.C. 415], as amended, includes military differential wage payments, as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 3401(h) [26 U.S.C. 3401(h)], as amended. Any payments made by the member to receive qualifying credit inconsistent with this provision must be refunded. Employees shall make application to the employer for credit and provide a DD Form 214 to verify service. If a participating member dies after December 31, 2006, while performing qualified military service, as defined in section 414(u)(5) [26 U.S.C. 414(u)(5)] of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the deceased member’s beneficiaries are entitled to any death benefits, other than credit for years of service for purposes of benefits, that would have been provided under the plan if the participating member had resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of death. The period of such member’s qualified military service is treated as vesting service under the plan.

       Uniform group insurance program created — Formation into subgroups.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to promote the economy and efficiency of employment in the state’s service, reduce personnel turnover, and offer an incentive to high-grade individuals to enter and remain in the service of state employment, there is created a uniform group insurance program. The uniform group must be composed of eligible and retired employees and be formed to provide hospital benefits coverage, medical benefits coverage, and life insurance benefits coverage in the manner set forth in this chapter. The uniform group may be divided into the following subgroups at the discretion of the board:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54c54-52.1s54-52.1-02ol11">
       Medical and hospital benefits coverage group consisting of active eligible employees and retired employees not eligible for Medicare, except for employees who first retire after July 1, 2015, and are not eligible for Medicare on their retirement. In determining premiums for coverage under this subsection for retired employees not eligible for Medicare, the rate for a non-Medicare retiree single plan is one hundred fifty percent of the active member single plan rate, the rate for a non-Medicare retiree family plan of two people is twice the non-Medicare retiree single plan rate, and the rate for a non-Medicare retiree family plan of three or more persons is two and one-half times the non-Medicare retiree single plan rate.
      </li>
      <li id="t54c54-52.1s54-52.1-02ol12">
       In addition to the coverage provided in subsection 1, another coverage option may be provided for retired employees not eligible for Medicare, except for employees who first retire after July 1, 2015, and are not eligible for Medicare on their retirement, provided the option does not increase the implicit subsidy as determined by the governmental accounting standards board’s other postemployment benefit reporting procedure. In offering this additional option, the board may have an open enrollment but thereafter enrollment for this option must be as specified in section 54-52.1-03.

       Any eligible employee may be enrolled in the uniform group insurance program created by this chapter by requesting enrollment with the employing department. If an eligible employee does not enroll in the uniform group insurance program at the time of beginning employment, in order to enroll at a later time the eligible employee must meet minimum requirements established by the board. An employing department may not require an active eligible employee to request coverage under the uniform group insurance program as a prerequisite to receive the minimum employer-paid life insurance benefits coverage or employee assistance program benefits coverage.

If a retiree or surviving spouse does not elect to participate at the times specified in this subsection, the retiree or surviving spouse must meet the minimum requirements established by the board. Subject to sections 54-52.1-03.2 and 54-52.1-03.3, each retiree or surviving spouse shall pay directly to the board the premiums in effect for the coverage then being provided. A retiree or surviving spouse who has met the initial eligibility requirements of this subsection to begin participation in the uniform group insurance program remains eligible as long as the retiree maintains the retiree’s participation in the program by paying the required premium pursuant to rules adopted by the board.

      If eligible under federal law, a political subdivision may extend the benefits of the uniform group insurance program under this chapter to its permanent employees, subject to minimum requirements established by the board and a minimum period of participation of sixty months. If the political subdivision withdraws from participation in the uniform group insurance program, before completing sixty months of participation, unless federal or state laws or rules are modified or interpreted in a way that makes participation by the political subdivision in the uniform group insurance program no longer allowable or appropriate, the political subdivision shall make payment to the board in an amount equal to any expenses incurred in the uniform group insurance program that exceed income received on behalf of the political subdivision’s employees as determined under rules adopted by the board. The Garrison Diversion Conservancy District, and district health units required to participate in the public employees retirement system under section 54-52-02, shall participate in the uniform group insurance program under the same terms and conditions as state agencies. A retiree who has accepted a retirement allowance from a participating political subdivision’s retirement plan may elect to participate in the uniform group under this chapter without meeting minimum requirements at age sixty-five, when the employee’s spouse reaches age sixty-five, upon the receipt of a benefit, when the political subdivision joins the uniform group insurance plan if the retiree was a member of the former plan, or when the spouse terminates employment. If a retiree or surviving spouse does not elect to participate at the times specified in this section, the retiree or surviving spouse must meet the minimum requirements established by the board. Each retiree or surviving spouse shall pay directly to the board the premiums in effect for the coverage then being provided. The board may require documentation that the retiree has accepted a retirement allowance from an eligible retirement plan other than the public employees retirement system.

      The office of management and budget shall transfer funds from the savings accruing to the agencies’ salaries and wages line item, as a result of the diminution of the state’s employer contribution for the Federal Insurance Contribution Act tax, to a payroll clearing account. The office of management and budget shall transfer funds from the payroll clearing account to the board as necessary to defray the reasonable expenses of administering the pretax benefits program established under this chapter, including expenses associated with the program’s medical spending account. Any revenue collected by the board from participating district health units must be used, and is hereby appropriated, to defray the expenses of administering the program. The amount necessary to pay consultants retained by the board, vendors retained by the board to provide claims administration services, any insurance costs associated with the medical spending account, and medical reimbursements for the medical spending account if funds are insufficient to pay claims are hereby appropriated from the savings and revenue generated by the program. All other expenses of administering the program must be paid in accordance with the agency’s appropriation authority as established by the legislative assembly. The director of the office of management and budget may decrease or suspend the transfer of the savings accruing to the agencies’ salaries and wages line item to the payroll clearing account upon determination that the funds deposited under this section are sufficient to offset anticipated obligations. Notwithstanding other provisions in this section, the public employees retirement system board, or any successor state agency, may not establish, enroll, or administer any pretax benefits program for a political subdivision or any other public or private business or entity, except for any program established specifically for employees of the state and employees of district health units.

Except as provided in section 54-52.6-03, an election made by an eligible employee under this section is irrevocable. The board shall accept written elections under this section from eligible employees during the period beginning on July 1, 1999, and ending 12:01 a.m. December 14, 2001. An eligible employee who does not make a written election or who does not file the election during the period specified in this section continues to be a member of the public employees retirement system. An eligible employee who makes and files a written election under this section ceases to be a member of the public employees retirement system effective twelve midnight December 31, 2001; becomes a participating member in the defined contribution retirement plan under this chapter effective 12:01 a.m. January 1, 2002; and waives all of that person’s rights to a pension, annuity, retirement allowance, insurance benefit, or any other benefit under the public employees retirement system effective December 31, 2001. This section does not affect a person’s right to health benefits or retiree health benefits under chapter 54-52.1. An eligible employee who is first employed and entered upon the payroll of that person’s employer after September 30, 2001, may make an election to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan established under this chapter at any time during the first six months after the date of employment. If the board, in its sole discretion, determines that the employee was not adequately notified of the employee’s option to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan, the board may provide the employee a reasonable time within which to make that election, which may extend beyond the original six-month decision window.

An election made by a deferred member under this section is irrevocable.

The contribution amount must be as provided in this chapter, regardless of the position in which the employee is employed. Notwithstanding the irrevocability provisions of this chapter, if a member who elects to participate in the retirement plan established under this chapter becomes a supreme or district court judge, becomes a member of the highway patrol, becomes employed in a position subject to teachers’ fund for retirement membership, or becomes an employee of the board of higher education or state institution under the jurisdiction of the board who is eligible to participate in an alternative retirement program established under subsection 6 of section 15-10-17, the member’s status as a member of the defined contribution retirement plan is suspended, and the member becomes a new member of the retirement plan for which that member’s new position is eligible. The member’s account balance remains in the defined contribution retirement plan, but no new contributions may be made to that account. The member’s service credit and salary history that were forfeited as a result of the member’s transfer to the defined contribution retirement plan remain forfeited, and service credit accumulation in the new retirement plan begins from the first day of employment in the new position. If the member later returns to employment that is eligible for the defined contribution plan, the member’s suspension must be terminated, the member again becomes a member of the defined contribution retirement plan, and the member’s account resumes accepting contributions. At the member’s option, and pursuant to rules adopted by the board, the member may transfer any available balance as determined by the provisions of the alternate retirement plan into the member’s account under this chapter.

       After consultation with its actuary, the board shall determine the method by which a participating member or deferred member may make a written election under this section. If the participating member or deferred member is married at the time of the election, the election is not effective unless the election is signed by the individual’s spouse. However, the board may waive this requirement if the spouse’s signature cannot be obtained because of extenuating circumstances.

       A participating member who becomes a temporary employee may still participate in the defined contribution retirement plan upon filing an election with the board within one hundred eighty days of transferring to temporary employee status. The participating member may not become a member of the defined benefit plan as a temporary employee. The temporary employee electing to participate in the defined contribution retirement plan shall pay monthly to the fund an amount equal to eight and twelve-hundredths percent times the temporary employee’s present monthly salary. The amount required to be paid by a temporary employee increases by two percent times the temporary employee’s present monthly salary beginning with the monthly reporting period of January 2012, and with an additional increase of two percent, beginning with the monthly reporting period of January 2013, and with an additional increase of two percent, beginning with the monthly reporting period of January 2014. The temporary employee shall also pay the required monthly contribution to the retiree health benefit fund established under section 54-52.1-03.2. This contribution must be recorded as a member contribution pursuant to section 54-52.1-03.2. An employer may not pay the temporary employee’s contributions. A temporary employee may continue to participate as a temporary employee until termination of employment or reclassification of the temporary employee as a permanent employee.

Neither the member nor the employer are required to make any future retirement contributions on behalf of that employee.

      A member re-employed under the Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act of 1994, as amended [Pub. L. 103-353; 108 Stat. 3150; 38 U.S.C. 4301-4333], is entitled to receive retirement credit for the period of qualified military service. The required contribution for the credit, including payment for retiree health benefits, must be made in the same manner and by the same party as would have been made had the employee been continuously employed. If the salary the member would have received during the period of service is not reasonably certain, the member’s average rate of compensation during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the member’s period of service or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding that period, times the number of months of credit being purchased must be used. Employees must be allowed up to three times the period of military service or five years, whichever is less, to make any required payments. This provision applies to all qualifying periods of military service since October 1, 1994. Effective for years after December 31, 2008, compensation for purposes of Internal Revenue Code section 415 [26 U.S.C. 415], as amended, includes military differential wage payments, as defined in Internal Revenue Code section 3401(h) [26 U.S.C. 3401(h)], as amended. Any payments made by the member to receive qualifying credit inconsistent with this provision must be refunded. Employees shall make application to the employer for credit and provide a DD Form 214 to verify service. After December 31, 2006, if a participating member dies while performing qualified military service, as defined in section 414(u)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. 414(u)(5)], as amended, the deceased member’s beneficiaries are entitled to any death benefits, other than credit for years of service for purposes of benefits, which would have been provided under the plan if the participating member had resumed employment and then terminated employment on account of death. The period of that member’s qualified military service is treated as vesting service under the plan.

       A “qualified domestic relations order” for purposes of this section means any judgment, decree, or order, including approval of a property settlement agreement, which relates to the provision of child support, spousal support, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participating member, is made pursuant to a North Dakota domestic relations law, which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee’s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a part of a participating member’s account in the defined contribution retirement plan under this chapter. A qualified domestic relations order may not require the board to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise allowed under this chapter. However, a qualified domestic relations order may require distribution from an account in the defined contribution retirement plan under this chapter notwithstanding that the participating member has not terminated eligible employment. A qualified domestic relations order must specify:

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is the finding of the legislative assembly that many of our citizens lack the opportunity to view, enjoy, or participate in living theatrical performances, musical concerts, operas, dance and ballet recitals, art exhibits, examples of fine architecture, and the performing and fine arts generally. It is further found that, with increasing leisure time, the practice and enjoyment of the arts are of increasing importance and that the general welfare of the people of the state will be promoted by giving further recognition to the arts as a vital aspect of our culture and heritage and as a valued means of expanding the scope of our educational programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is declared to be the policy of the state to join with private patrons and with institutions and professional organizations concerned with the arts to ensure that the role of the arts in the life of our communities will continue to grow and will play an evermore significant part in the welfare and educational experience of our citizens.

In making these appointments, due consideration must be given to the recommendations made by representative civic, educational, and professional associations and groups, concerned with or engaged in the production or presentation of the performing and fine arts generally.

Other than the chairman, no member of the council who serves a full five-year term is eligible for reappointment during a one-year period following the expiration of the term. The governor shall designate a chairman and a vice chairman from the members of the council who shall serve at the pleasure of the governor. The chairman is the chief executive officer of the council. The members of the council may not receive any compensation for their services, but must be reimbursed for their travel expenses in the same manner and at the same rates as provided by law for other state officials for necessary travel in the performance of their duties as members of the council.

      Each commissioner shall attend the annual meeting of the national conference of commissioners on uniform state laws and shall promote uniformity in state laws on those subjects where uniformity may be deemed desirable and practicable. The commission shall also promote as far as practicable the uniform judicial application and construction of all uniform state laws. During the interim between legislative sessions, the commission may submit its recommendations for enactment of uniform and model laws to the legislative management for its review and recommendation. Commissioners shall provide such assistance to the legislative management as the legislative management requests with respect to its review of uniform and model laws. During each biennial legislative session, and at any other time as the commission may deem proper, the commission shall report to the legislative assembly an account of its transactions and its advice and recommendations for legislation. The report must include the recommendations of the legislative management with respect to uniform and model laws recommended by the commission.

   An employee’s petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the Director of the Office of Administrative Hearings to appoint an attorney to preside over the employee’s hearing was properly denied; the employee could have raised the issue on appeal and therefore had a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.

   Where an agency requests that the Office of Administrative Hearings designate an ALJ to issue a final decision, judicial review of the ALJ’s factual findings should involve the same standard of review used for agency decisions, but the ALJ’s legal conclusions must be reviewed in the same manner as legal conclusions generally, without special deference to the ALJ.

      The information technology department is established with the responsibility for all wide area network services planning, selection, and implementation for all state agencies, including institutions under the control of the board of higher education, counties, cities, and school districts in this state. With respect to a county, city, or school district, wide area network services are those services necessary to transmit voice, data, or video outside the county, city, or school district. In exercising its powers and duties, the department is responsible for computer support services, host software development, statewide communications services, standards for providing information to other state agencies and the public through the internet, technology planning, process redesign, and quality assurance. The department may not exercise its powers and duties in a manner that competes or otherwise interferes with the provision of telecommunications service to a private, charitable, or nonprofit entity by a privately or cooperatively owned telecommunications company.

Const. art. X, § 18 against gifts of public funds. Moreover, the public purpose component of N.D. Const. art. X, § 18 and due process under the Fourteenth Amendment were satisfied because economic development programs promote the prosperity and general welfare of the people within a governmental entity.

       At a minimum, the financial obligation provision of a business incentive agreement must require a recipient that fails to meet business incentive agreement goals to pay back to the grantor the assistance, prorated to reflect any partial fulfillment of goals. A grantor may extend for up to one year the period for meeting the business incentive agreement goals if the grantor determines that circumstances have made it impossible for the recipient to achieve the required goals. A grantor may extend the period for meeting business incentive agreement goals by another additional year by documenting in writing the reason for the extension and attaching a copy of the documentation to the grantor’s next annual report. Notwithstanding the five-year commitment in the business incentive agreement, a grantor may authorize a recipient to move from the jurisdiction in which the business incentive is used within the five-year period after the benefit date if, after a public hearing, the grantor approves the recipient’s request to move. If after extending the period for achieving the goals of the business incentive agreement for two years a grantor determines that a business incentive agreement goal of creation or retention of jobs has changed and justifies a decrease, after a public hearing, the grantor may decrease the job goals in the agreement to a lesser number or to zero and may adjust the average compensation goals to reflect changed circumstances. Justification for decreasing job goals may include that other public benefits adequately offset the failure to meet the initial job goals.

       Prohibition on delivering campaign contributions — Penalty.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A lobbyist may not deliver knowingly a campaign contribution made by another person in violation of subsection 3 of section 2 of article XIV of the Constitution of North Dakota. For a first violation, the commission may assess a civil penalty of five hundred dollars upon any individual who knowingly violates this section. For a second and subsequent knowing violation of this section, the person is guilty of a class B misdemeanor, and, if the lobbyist is a registered lobbyist and the secretary of state is notified of the violation by the commission, a state’s attorney, or a court, the secretary of state shall revoke the lobbyist’s registration. For purposes of this section, “deliver” means to transport, transfer, or otherwise transmit, either physically or electronically. This prohibition does not apply to an individual who delivers a campaign contribution to the individual’s own campaign or to the campaign of the individual’s immediate family member. This prohibition may not be interpreted to prohibit any person from making a campaign contribution, encouraging others to make a campaign contribution, or otherwise supporting or opposing a candidate.
