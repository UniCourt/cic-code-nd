Notification of the director’s opinion of significance must be communicated to the appropriate governing official. The state historical board through the director, within sixty days of written notification to it by the appropriate governing official of the state or political subdivision’s desire, need, or intent to destroy, alter, remove, or otherwise dispose of a significant artifact or site, shall provide the governing official written direction for the care, protection, excavation, storage, destruction, or other disposition of the significant artifact or site. The state and its political subdivisions shall cooperate with the director in identifying and implementing any reasonable alternative to destruction or alteration of any historical or archaeological artifact or site significant in understanding and interpreting the history and prehistory of the state before the state historical board may approve the demolition or alteration.

       Protection of public health and safety on sites having a public function.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the state or a political subdivision has a property interest in real property and that property has an existing public function in addition to any historical site registration or historical significance determination, the governing body of the agency or political subdivision owning the property interest may, subject to the following provisions, improve, alter, modify, or destroy that property if the agency or governing body determines that action is necessary to protect public health or safety, to provide access for disabled persons, or to ensure structural integrity. If an action is to be taken by an agency or governing body under this section, notice of intent to take the action must be given to the director at the onset of the planning process. At the director’s request, the agency or governing body shall inform the director of each meeting at which planning or decisions on a project are on the agenda. At each meeting, the agency or governing body shall provide the director with an opportunity to comment or provide preservation funding for the proposed project and the agency or governing body shall consider the director’s comments or offers of funding in the development and implementation of the project. If the agency or governing body and the director do not agree on the action to be taken, the differences must be submitted to a mediator selected by the governor to facilitate a consensus between the parties. The cost of the mediator must be shared equally by the parties. The mediator shall issue a report within sixty days of appointment by the governor. The report of the mediator must be sent to the director and must be published once in the official newspaper of the political subdivision. Although the agency or governing body may take the action it deems necessary, the agency or governing body shall make all reasonable effort to preserve the historical characteristics of a site taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. The agency or governing body must notify the director of its decision and must publish it once in the official newspaper of the political subdivision. After mediation, if any, if the governing body of a political subdivision determines to proceed with actions that will result in completely demolishing, removing, or significantly degrading the historical characteristics of a building or real property, a resident of the political subdivision where the building or real property is located may submit a written notice to the county auditor of intention to petition for a public vote. The notice must be filed with the county auditor within fourteen days of the publication of the decision of the governing body. A petition for a public vote must contain the names of at least ten percent of the qualified electors from that governing body’s jurisdiction who voted in the last general election and must be filed with the county auditor within one hundred twenty days of the governing body’s publication of notice of its final action. If a petition is filed, the matter must be submitted for a vote of the qualified electors at the next special, primary, or general election held in that jurisdiction. All actions to remove, demolish, or significantly degrade the historical characteristics of a building or real property are stayed for fourteen days after the governing body’s publication of notice of its final action, and if notice of intention to seek a public vote is filed, actions are stayed until either the petition fails or the public vote is held. If the political subdivision is a home rule jurisdiction with its own referendum procedures, however, the home rule referendum procedures apply to the action of the governing body.

       Depositories of archival resources.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The state historical society is the depository of the archival resources of the state. However, the state historical society may enter into agreements with the state universities or any other public or quasi-public or private institutions, agencies, or corporations to serve as depositories of regional archival resources. The agreements must specify the area to be served by the depositories and the method of assessing, cataloging, housing, preserving, and servicing materials placed by the state archivist in the regional depositories. The state archivist may deposit in regional depositories, with title remaining with the state historical society, the records of state agencies or their district or regional offices which are primarily located in the geographic area serviced by the depository. All archival resources from central departments, offices, and agencies must be placed in the main archives in the heritage center in Bismarck under the state historical society’s immediate jurisdiction. However, the state archivist may place archival resources temporarily at a regional depository. The state archivist may take any steps deemed necessary to provide for the safety of archival resources and other articles and materials entrusted to the archivist’s custody in the archives, including temporary removal to safer locations, as may be dictated by any disaster emergency situation.

The bonds may be issued in one or more series, may bear such date or dates, may mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their date, may be in such denomination or denominations, may be in such form, either coupon or fully registered or registered as to ownership or principal, may carry such registration and conversion privileges, may be executed in such manner, may be payable in such medium of payment at such place or places, may be subject to such terms of redemption with or without premium, and may bear such rate or rates of interest, as may be provided by resolution or resolutions to be adopted by the board, subject to this section. The bonds may be sold in such manner and at such price or prices, not less than ninety-eight percent of par plus accrued interest to date of delivery, as may be considered by the board to be advisable. The bonds must have all of the qualities and incidents of negotiable paper, and the bonds and the income from the bonds are exempt from any taxes, except inheritance, estate, and transfer taxes. The board may in its discretion authorize one series of bonds hereunder for more than one project, at more than one state park, state campground, state recreation area, or reserve. It may also issue series of bonds hereunder for the refunding of outstanding bonds issued hereunder when such action is desirable in its judgment and is consistent with the terms of the resolution or resolutions authorizing the outstanding bonds.

      After the issuance of any bonds under section 55-08-08, the state treasurer shall transfer revenues at the times and in the amounts directed in section 55-08-07 to a special trust fund to be known as the state park revenue bond fund, which must be maintained in the state treasury until all bonds issued under section 55-08-08 and all interest on the bonds is fully paid and discharged. This fund must be disbursed by the state treasurer solely for the purpose of paying principal and interest when due on the bonds, and the treasurer shall also maintain in the fund, by the transfer of revenues from the state park fund whenever necessary and available, a reserve at all times equal to the total amount of principal and interest to become due on all the bonds within the then next period of twelve months. As principal and interest become due from time to time, the director of the office of management and budget, not less than fifteen days before the payment dates, shall issue warrants upon the state treasurer against the revenue bond fund for the amount of the payment coming due, and the state treasurer shall make payments from the fund of the amounts due.

       Uniform complaint and summons — Promise to appear — Penalty.

     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby established a uniform complaint and summons which may be used in cases involving violations of this chapter. Whenever the complaint and summons established by this section is used, the provisions of the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to arrests without warrants do not apply, and the magistrates or state’s attorneys are not required to make another complaint of the offense charged in the uniform complaint and summons. The uniform complaint and summons must be of a form prescribed by the director and approved by the attorney general. The time of court appearance to be specified in the summons must be at least five days after the issuance of such summons unless the defendant demands an earlier hearing. Upon receipt from the defendant of written promise to appear at the time and place specified in the summons, the defendant must be released from custody. After signing a promise to appear, the defendant must be given a copy of the uniform complaint and summons. Any person refusing to give such written promise to appear may be arrested if proper cause exists, or proceeded against by complaint and warrant of arrest issued as provided in the North Dakota Rules of Criminal Procedure. Defendant’s failure to appear at the time and place designated after signing a promise to appear is a class B misdemeanor. The uniform summons and complaint may not be used if the officer, acting within the officer’s discretion, has reason to believe the defendant will not be subject to arrest upon a warrant issued by a magistrate. The halting officer shall immediately take any person not released upon the person’s promise to appear before the nearest or most accessible magistrate.

   Subdivision 4 of this section must be construed to give the board the authority to place sites of historical value on the registry. County of Stutsman v. State Historical Soc'y, 371 N.W.2d 321, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 354</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>

   The authority to put historical sites on the registry involves a proper delegation of power by the legislature to the board. County of Stutsman v. State Historical Soc'y, 371 N.W.2d 321, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 354</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   Failure of the legislature to define “historical value” in subdivision 4 of this section, which prior to its amendment in 1985 provided that the state historic sites registry should be a listing of sites designated by the state historical board of the state historical society as possessing historical value, did not deprive the board of its authority to place sites on the registry, nor render subdivision 4 unconstitutionally vague. County of Stutsman v. State Historical Soc'y, 371 N.W.2d 321, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 354</cite> (N.D. 1985).

   Stutsman County, owner of courthouse placed by the state historical board on the state historic sites registry pursuant to subdivision 4 of this section, could not successfully assert a violation of its constitutional rights by virtue of the board’s action, because it is not a person or private party.

The party desiring arbitration shall make a written demand therefor of the other and in the demand shall name three arbitrators. The demand must also set forth the objections that the party desires to submit to arbitration, with reference to the particular state historic site. The demand must be made within ninety days of a decision by the board. The demand must be served upon the other party, which, within ten days, shall name in writing three arbitrators, and set forth in writing its response to the objections set forth in the demand served upon it and any additional objections that it desires to submit to arbitration on its part.

The submission must also provide that each party shall bear its own arbitration costs and expenses, however, the costs and expenses relating to the seventh arbitrator must be borne equally by both parties to the dispute. The seven arbitrators shall proceed to resolve the controversies brought before them, and the decision of the arbitrators, or a majority of them, must be given in writing to the parties concerned and is binding upon both parties. Thereafter, the arbitration must proceed in accordance with chapter 32-29.2.

     <p>
      As a result of the continuing growth of the population and development of the economy of the state of North Dakota, it is necessary and desirable that natural areas be set aside and preserved for the benefit of present and future generations before such areas are destroyed. Such areas are irreplaceable as laboratories for scientific research; as reservoirs of natural materials not all of the uses of which are now known; as habitats for plant and animal species and biotic communities, the diversity of which enriches the meaning and enjoyment of human life; as living museums where people may observe natural biotic and environmental systems of the earth and the interdependence of all forms of life; as examples of our natural heritage; and as reminders of the vital dependence of the health of the human community upon the health of the natural communities of which human health is an inseparable part. It is essential to the people of the state of North Dakota that they retain the opportunities to maintain close contact with such living communities and environmental systems of the earth and to benefit from the scientific, aesthetic, cultural, and spiritual values they possess. It is therefore the public policy of the state of North Dakota that such areas be acquired and preserved by the state and that other agencies, organizations, and individuals, both public and private, be encouraged to set aside such areas for the common benefit of the people of present and future generations.
