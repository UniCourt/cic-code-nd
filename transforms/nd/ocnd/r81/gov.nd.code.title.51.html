   Chapter 201, S.L. 1911, was not intended to prevent the producers of the state from marketing the products of their farms in villages and cities without the payment of the license fee imposed. State v. Fleming, 24 N.D. 593, 140 N.W. 674, 1913 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 1913).

   A merchant was one who bought to sell, or bought and sold, goods or merchandise in a store or shop. State v. Fleming, 24 N.D. 593, 140 N.W. 674, 1913 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 1913).

   Person who grew his own fruit, shipped it into state and sold it at retail from car placed on sidetrack within limits of a village was not a transient merchant; transient merchant was one who engaged in sale of merchandise at any place within state temporarily and who did not intend to become, and did not become, a permanent merchant at such place.

      Every clerk of an auction sale, at all times, shall maintain in the clerk’s name or firm name, a separate trust account designated as such in a federally insured bank or other federally insured depository in this state in which the clerk immediately shall deposit all funds not the clerk’s own, including funds in which the clerk may have some future interest or claim. A federally insured depository located outside the state but licensed as a clerk in this state is not required to deposit funds in a depository in this state if auction sale funds are deposited in a separate trust account designated as such in the licensee’s depository. A clerk may not commingle the clerk’s personal funds or other funds in a trust account except that a clerk may deposit and keep a sum of one thousand dollars in such account from the clerk’s personal funds, which sum must be specifically identified and deposited to cover service charges related to the trust account. In conjunction with such account, the clerk shall maintain at the clerk’s usual place of business books, records, and other documents so that the adequacy of such account may be determined at any time. Trust accounts and other records must be open to inspection by the public service commission and its duly authorized agents at all times during regular business hours at the clerk’s usual place of business.

All such trading stamps must, at the option of the holder, be redeemable in cash at any office or agency of the trading stamp company redeeming the trading stamps in merchandise or at any business establishment furnishing such trading stamps with the sale of merchandise. Provided, further, that the provisions of this chapter do not apply to any coupon, ticket, certificate, card, or other similar device issued or distributed by a manufacturer or packer, which is redeemable for any goods, wares, or merchandise, either by the manufacturer or packer, or their agents, or an independent contractor acting for redemption.

       <p>

   This statute is rationally related to the state’s significant and legitimate interest in providing protection to distributors of vehicles and farm implements and does not violate the state or federal constitutional standards of interstate commerce, of impairment of contractual obligations, of deprivation of property without due process of law, and of special privileges and immunities. Hall GMC v. Crane Carrier Co., 332 N.W.2d 54, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state’s strong interest in protecting distributors, coupled with the conclusion that courts will defer to legislative judgment to determine the appropriateness of the action taken to remedy the societal harm, lends itself to the conclusion that this section does not violate the contract clause of the United States Constitution. Farmers Union Oil Co. v. Allied Prods. Corp., 162 B.R. 834, 1993 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18818 (D.N.D. 1993).

        This section was intended to remedy the problem which arises when a dealer has been required by the terms of a franchise agreement to invest in purchases of equipment in order to maintain a specified level of inventory parts or machinery, thereby using cash assets that would ordinarily be available for operating expenses. In such instances, the manufacturer shares the fault, should the situation arise where the dealer is unable to continue in business. In re Hausauer Implement Co., 35 B.R. 661, 1983 Bankr.

   This section applied to written contracts only. Bostow v. Lundell Mfg. Co., 376 N.W.2d 20, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 418</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>

   The 1961 amendment to this section reflects the legislature’s intention to change the earlier law and to limit the statute’s coverage to written contracts. Bostow v. Lundell Mfg. Co., 376 N.W.2d 20, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 418</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   The second paragraph of this section, which was added by amendment in 1971, was designed to insure that a retailer’s election to pursue his contract remedy does not bar his right to the statutory remedy. Nowhere does the legislative history of this 1971 amendment indicate any legislative intent to contradict the specific reference in the first paragraph to a written contract so as to expand the statute’s coverage to include oral contract. Bostow v. Lundell Mfg. Co., 376 N.W.2d 20, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 418</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>

   The third paragraph of this section does not denote any legislative intent to place all contracts, written and oral, within the coverage of this section. Bostow v. Lundell Mfg. Co., 376 N.W.2d 20, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 418</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        This section is not applicable in instances where the written agreement does not specifically require the dealer to maintain a stock of parts or whole machines. In re Hausauer Implement Co., 35 B.R. 661, 1983 Bankr. LEXIS 4838 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1983).

      <li id="t51c51-07s51-07-01.1ol11">
       Any manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor of merchandise and tools covered under section 51-07-01, excluding automobile dealers, truck dealers, or parts dealers of the automobiles or trucks, that enters a contract with any person engaged in the business of retailing the covered merchandise by which the retailer agrees to maintain a stock of the covered merchandise may not terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the contract with the retailer without good cause.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-07s51-07-01.1ol12">
       For the purpose of this section, good cause for terminating, canceling, or failing to renew a contract is limited to failure by the retailer to substantially comply with those essential and reasonable requirements imposed by the contract between the parties if the requirements are not different from those requirements imposed on other similarly situated retailers. The determination by the manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor of good cause for the termination, cancellation, or failure to renew must be made in good faith.

       In any action against a manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor for violation of this section, the manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor shall establish that the termination, cancellation, or failure to renew was made in good faith for good cause. If a notice of termination is issued and the dealer challenges the notice by filing an action, there is an automatic stay during the pendency of the action. If the manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor fails to establish good cause for its action, the manufacturer, wholesaler, or distributor is liable for all special and general damages sustained by the plaintiff, including the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorney’s fees for prosecuting the action and the plaintiff, if appropriate, is entitled to injunctive relief. This section applies to all contracts now in effect which have no expiration date and are continuing contracts and all other contracts entered, amended, or renewed after July 31, 2003. Any contract in force and effect on August 1, 2003, which by its terms will terminate on a date subsequent thereto is governed by the law as it existed before August 1, 2003.

   Where dealer was in default on his payments to manufacturer for three equipment purchases, he breached the dealership contract, thereby giving manufacturer good cause, for purposes of this section, to terminate the dealership agreement.

   “Good cause” under this section must relate to a dealer’s compliance with the requirements imposed by a written dealership agreement and a manufacturer must make a good faith determination about good cause.

   Where it was undisputed that dealer was in default on payments to manufacturer, trial court’s finding that manufacturer’s termination of the dealership agreement was not in bad faith was one of law.

   Evidence about a manufacturer’s treatment of other similarly situated dealerships in an action for bad faith termination of a farm implement dealership under this section may have some probative value to establish “good cause” and “good faith” for the termination of the dealership agreement. Where plaintiff and another dealership were not in substantially similar financial condition, exclusion of the evidence about the non-party dealership was not abuse of discretion. Williston Farm Equip. v. Steiger Tractor, 504 N.W.2d 545, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1993).

   dealership agreement and that any such termination by plaintiff would be in bad faith would not be dismissed because it was not duplicative of plaintiff’s claim for a declaratory judgment that it had good cause to terminate the agreement. Because plaintiff had not yet sent defendant a notice of termination, defendant was not entitled to costs or attorney’s fees under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t51c51-07s51-07-01.1" target="_self">51-07-01.1</a></cite>(3), so defendant’s request for the same was premature.

This subdivision does not prevent a farm equipment dealer and manufacturer from agreeing to those terms if the agreement was supported by separate and valuable consideration. The issuance, reissuance, or extension of a dealership contract alone is not separate and valuable consideration.
        </li>
        <li id="t51c51-07s51-07-01.2ol11e">
         Require a farm equipment dealer to either establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space or to abandon an existing relationship with another manufacturer in order to continue, renew, reinstate, or enter a dealer agreement or to participate in any program discount, credit, rebate, or sales incentive. This subdivision does not prevent a farm equipment dealer and manufacturer from agreeing to establish or maintain exclusive facilities for separate and valuable consideration.

A substantial change in the competitive circumstances includes the removal of authorization to operate at a location from where the dealer is currently operating or the unreasonable removal of a product line or segment.

         Require a farm equipment dealer to unreasonably remodel, renovate, or recondition the dealer’s facilities, change the location of the facilities, or make unreasonable alterations to the dealership premises. A request for a dealer to remodel, renovate, or recondition the dealer’s facilities, change the location of the facilities, or make alterations to the dealership premises must be considered in light of current and reasonably foreseeable projections of economic conditions, financial expectations, and the dealer’s market for the sale of farm equipment. A facility modification request is unreasonable if the request is within seven years of a farm equipment dealer’s most recent facility remodel, renovation, or reconditioning.

The audit and chargeback provisions in this subdivision apply to all incentive and reimbursement programs that are subject to audit by a manufacturer. Before imposing a chargeback, a manufacturer shall identify each claim at issue and provide the dealer with written explanation for the proposed chargeback for each claim. The cumulative value of any chargeback, fees, penalties, or adverse action for an individual claim may not exceed the total direct compensation received by the dealer for the claim at issue. Thereafter, the manufacturer shall provide the dealer a reasonable time, no less than forty-five days, to present additional information regarding a claim at issue.

       In Fifth Amendment takings action by car dealers whose franchise agreements were rejected when automobile manufacturer went into bankruptcy, court entered findings in favor of United States because car dealers failed to establish government coerced manufacturer into filing for bankruptcy under government’s negotiated bankruptcy terms or into rejecting any franchise agreements. Because evidence established that manufacturer would have faced immediate liquidation in Chapter 7 bankruptcy without government assistance, dealers failed to prove franchise agreements would have had value in “but-for world” without government assistance. Thus, dealers failed to prove property was “taken” from them. Colonial Chevrolet Co. v. United States, 145 Fed. Cl. 243, 2019 U.S. Claims LEXIS 1311 (Fed. Cl. Oct. 2, 2019), aff'd, 841 Fed.

In addition, a motor vehicle manufacturer shall provide adequate time allowances for diagnosis and performance of warranty work and service for the work performed. The hourly labor rate paid by a motor vehicle manufacturer to the dealer for warranty services may not be less than the average rate charged by the dealer for like service to nonwarranty customers for nonwarranty service as provided under subsection 5.

       A commercial manufacturer shall include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair service, parts, and labor, in warranty work compensation. In addition, a commercial manufacturer shall provide adequate time allowances for diagnosis and performance of warranty work and service for the work performed. The hourly labor rate paid by a commercial manufacturer to the commercial equipment dealer for warranty services may not be less than the average rate charged by the commercial equipment dealer for like service to nonwarranty customers for nonwarranty service. A commercial manufacturer may not reimburse a commercial equipment dealer for parts used in the performance of warranty repair at a lower rate than the average retail rate customarily charged by the commercial equipment dealer for these parts as provided under subsection 5.

       A commercial manufacturer shall pay a commercial equipment dealer on a claim made by a commercial equipment dealer under this section within thirty days of the approval of the claim. The commercial manufacturer either shall approve or disapprove a claim within thirty days after the claim is submitted to the commercial manufacturer. The commercial manufacturer may prescribe the manner in which and the forms on which the commercial equipment dealer must present the claim. A claim not specifically disapproved in writing within thirty days after the commercial manufacturer receives the claim must be construed to be approved and the manufacturer shall pay the claim within thirty days.

       A commercial manufacturer, commercial distributor, or commercial distributor branch shall compensate fully its commercial equipment dealers licensed in this state for warranty parts, work, and service specified in this section.

      <li id="t51c51-07s51-07-31ol15">
       The retail rate customarily charged by the commercial equipment dealer for parts is established by the commercial equipment dealer submitting to the commercial manufacturer or commercial distributor one hundred sequential nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts or ninety consecutive days of nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders that contain warranty-like parts, whichever is less, covering repairs made no more than one hundred eighty days before the submission and declaring the average percentage markup.

       The retail rate customarily charged by the commercial equipment dealer for labor must be established using the same process as provided under subsection 5 and declaring the average labor rate. The average labor rate must be determined by dividing the amount of the dealer’s total labor sales by the number of total hours that generated those sales. If a labor rate and parts markup rate are simultaneously declared by the commercial equipment dealer, the commercial equipment dealer may use the same repair orders to complete each calculation as provided under subsection 5.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-07s51-07-31ol17">
       In calculating the retail rate customarily charged by the commercial equipment dealer for parts and labor, the following work may not be included in the calculation:

      <li id="t51c51-07s51-07-31ol18">
       The average of the parts markup rates and labor rate is presumed to be fair and reasonable and must become effective thirty days following the commercial manufacturer’s approval. Not later than thirty days after submission, a commercial manufacturer or commercial distributor may rebut the presumption by reasonably substantiating that a rate is unreasonable in light of the practices of all other commercial equipment dealers in an economically similar area of the state offering the commercial equipment dealer’s declaration of the same part, or vehicular implement, equipment, accessory, or attachment unit. If the average parts markup rate or average labor rate, or both are rebutted, the commercial manufacturer or commercial distributor shall propose an adjustment of the average percentage markup based on that rebuttal not later than thirty days after submission.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-07s51-07-31ol19">
       Each commercial manufacturer, in establishing a schedule of compensation for warranty work, shall rely on the commercial equipment dealer’s written schedule of hourly labor rates and parts and may not obligate any commercial equipment dealer to engage in unduly burdensome or time-consuming documentation of rates or parts, including obligating commercial equipment dealers to engage in transaction-by-transaction or part-by-part calculations.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-07s51-07-31ol110">
       A commercial dealer or commercial manufacturer may demand the average parts markup or average labor rate be calculated using the process provided under subsections 5 and 6; however, the demand for the average parts markup may not be made within twelve months of the last parts markup declaration and the demand for the average labor rate may not be made within twelve months of the last labor rate declaration. If a parts markup or labor rate is demanded by the commercial equipment dealer or commercial manufacturer, the commercial equipment dealer shall determine the repair orders to be included in the calculation under subsections 5 and 6.

   Where defendant engaged in false advertising, resulting in a decline in plaintiff’s business and causing plaintiff to counteract with its own advertisements to mitigate damages, plaintiff was not limited to injunctive relief under the false advertising statutes, and was allowed to collect actual and punitive damages and court costs. Fargo Women's Health Org. v. FM Women's Help &amp; Caring Connection, 444 N.W.2d 683, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1989), overruled in part, Trade 'N Post, L.L.C. v.

        Court granted a herbicide manufacturer summary judgment as to a farm corporation’s claim of false advertising under N.D.C.C. §§ 51-12-01, 51-12-08 because the only relief available under N.D.C.C. ch. 51-12 was injunctive relief, and while the corporation had standing to maintain an action for injunctive relief under N.D.C.C. § 51-12-14, the complaint made no request for injunctive relief; the corporation sought only economic and non-economic damages, costs, disbursements, attorney’s fees, and such other and further relief that the court deemed just and appropriate, but the language “such other and further relief” did not amount to a request for injunctive relief in the case.

   Individual claiming that a brochure distributed by the medical clinic violated false advertising laws did not have standing to bring the suit; she lacked injury, and she admitted that she had not even read the brochures before bringing suit. Kjolsrud v. MKB Mgmt. Corp., 2003 ND 144, 669 N.W.2d 82, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       <p>
        Court granted a herbicide manufacturer summary judgment as to a farm corporation’s claim of false advertising under N.D.C.C. §§ 51-12-01, 51-12-08 because the only relief available under N.D.C.C. ch. 51-12 was injunctive relief, and while the corporation had standing to maintain an action for injunctive relief under N.D.C.C. § 51-12-14, the complaint made no request for injunctive relief; the corporation sought only economic and non-economic damages, costs, disbursements, attorney’s fees, and such other and further relief that the court deemed just and appropriate, but the language “such other and further relief” did not amount to a request for injunctive relief in the case.

        Revolving Charge Agreement Not Established.

   In a case involving the default of promissory notes, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of an assignee because the notes, which were executed to finance crops, unambiguously constituted traditional loans of money since they used the terms “principal” and “interest,” rather than “credit extended” and “credit service charge”; therefore, they did not fall under the definition of revolving charge account agreements.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Every revolving charge agreement must be in writing and must be accepted by the retail buyer. As used in this section, “accepted” means the buyer has signed the revolving charge agreement, the buyer has used the account issued under a revolving charge agreement, or within thirty days from the date of issuance the buyer has not canceled by written notice a credit card or other access device issued under a revolving charge agreement. A copy of the revolving charge agreement must be delivered or mailed to the retail buyer by the retail seller before the date on which the first payment is due under the agreement. A revolving charge agreement must state the amount and rate of the credit service charge to be charged and paid under the agreement. The credit service charge, exclusive of late payment or other fees included therein, must be set forth in the revolving charge agreement in terms of a monthly or annual percentage rate to be applied to the balance outstanding from time to time under the agreement, as of the beginning or end of each billing period or on a daily basis. Upon written notice, a seller may change the terms of any revolving charge agreement, including the credit service charge, if this right of amendment has been reserved. A change under this authority is effective as to existing balances, if within twenty-five days of the effective date of the change, the buyer does not furnish written notice to the seller that the buyer does not agree to abide by the changes. Upon receipt of this written notice by the seller, the buyer has the remainder of the time under the existing terms in which to pay all sums owed to the seller. Any request for additional credit under a revolving charge agreement, including use of a credit card issued under the agreement, after the effective date of the change of terms, including a change in the credit service charge, is deemed to be an acceptance of the new terms, even though the twenty-five days has not expired. The retail seller under a revolving charge agreement shall promptly supply the retail buyer under the agreement with a statement as of the end of each monthly period or other regular period agreed upon by the retail seller and the retail buyer, in which there is any unpaid balance thereunder. Such statement must recite the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t51c51-14s51-14-02ol11">
       The unpaid balance under the revolving charge agreement at the beginning or end of the period.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-14s51-14-02ol12">
       An identification of the goods or services purchased, the cash purchase price and the date of each purchase, unless otherwise furnished by the retail seller to the retail buyer by sales slip, memorandum, or otherwise.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-14s51-14-02ol13">
       The payments made by the retail buyer to the retail seller and any other credits to the retail buyer during the period.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-14s51-14-02ol14">
       The amount of the credit service charge, if any, and also the percentage annual simple interest equivalent of this amount.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-14s51-14-02ol15">
       A legend to the effect that the retail buyer may at any time pay the total indebtedness.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The items need not be stated in the sequence or order set forth in this section. Additional items may be included to explain the computations made in determining the amount to be paid by the retail buyer. If a revolving charge or credit account is also subject to the Truth in Lending Act [15 U.S.C. 1601-1667e], the seller may, instead of complying with this section, comply with all requirements of the Truth in Lending Act.

   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t51c51-14s51-14-02" target="_self">51-14-02</a></cite> did not address unconscionability, nor did it give credit card companies carte blanche to impose upon cardholders whatever terms they desired, regardless of how unfair, one-sided, or oppressive they may be; the statute did not specifically authorize wholesale amendment of a credit card agreement by a sixteen-page bill stuffer, nor did it say all amendments to agreements complying with the statutory procedure were necessarily valid and enforceable.

     <p>
      In a revolving charge agreement, a seller may contract for and, if so contracted for, the seller or holder of the agreement may charge, receive, and collect the service charge authorized by this section. The service charge may not exceed the amount agreed to by the parties. In the event any payment by a buyer is insufficient to pay both the credit service charge and that portion of the outstanding indebtedness then due, the payments must first be applied to the credit service charge then due.

   The test for determining unauthorized use is agency, with state agency law used to resolve the issue. Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Standard Oil Co., 325 N.W.2d 210, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 346</cite> (N.D. 1982).

   Card issuer was unable to rely upon the doctrine of ostensible authority when claiming that corporate cardholder’s employee was authorized to request and use the credit card where the issuer was negligent in issuing the card without independently verifying the employee’s authority.

      A provision imposing liability on a cardholder for the unauthorized use of a credit card is effective only if the card is an accepted credit card, the liability imposed is not in excess of one hundred dollars, the card issuer gives adequate notice to the cardholder of the potential liability, and the unauthorized use occurs before the cardholder has notified the card issuer of the loss or theft of the card or of any unauthorized use.

     <p>
      Except as hereinbefore provided, a cardholder incurs no liability from the unauthorized use of either an accepted or an unaccepted credit card.

   In response to a certified question of law from a U.S. district court, the North Dakota Supreme Court concluded that North Dakota’s Consumer Fraud Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 51-15, may apply to a transaction in which a farmer, who purchased confection sunflower seed for use in cultivating a sunflower crop for subsequent sale, alleges the seed to be defective and claims it was marketed and sold in violation of the Act. Jorgenson v. Agway, Inc., 2001 ND 104, 627 N.W.2d 391, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>

   Provisions of the North Dakota Unlawful Sales or Advertising Practices Act creating a private cause of action were inapplicable in an action by a debtor’s customers against a creditor because statements made by the creditor to the debtor were not made to the customers, nor were they made in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise by the debtor or creditor.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because a USDA deregulation petition, earnings conference call, and a request form for a certificate issued by the Chinese government were not directed to defendant's purchasers, then plaintiffs did not state plausible North Dakota consumer protection claims that alleged misrepresentations contained therein were made in connection with the sale or advertisement of defendant's products.

        7 U.S.C.S. § 136v(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) preempted a farm corporation’s Consumer Fraud Act claims against a herbicide manufacturer pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, because N.D.C.C. § 51-15-02 clearly imposed a broader obligation than FIFRA’s requirement that labels not contain “false or misleading” statements, and N.D.C.C.§ 51-15-02 was not genuinely equivalent to FIFRA’s obligation under 7 U.S.C.S. § 136(q)(1)(A).

      In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol11">
       “Consumer goods or services” means goods or services purchased, leased, or rented primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, including courses of instruction or training regardless of the purpose for which they are taken.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol12">
       “Person” includes a corporation, limited liability company, company, partnership, firm, association, or society, as well as a natural person. When the word “person” is used to designate the party whose property may be the subject of a criminal or public offense, the term includes the United States, this state, or any territory, state, or country, or any political subdivision of this state which may lawfully own any property, or a public or private corporation, limited liability company, or partnership or association. When the word “person” is used to designate the violator or offender of any law, it includes corporation, limited liability company, partnership, or any association of persons.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol13">
       “Personal solicitation sale” means a sale, lease, or rental of consumer goods or services in which the seller or the seller’s representative solicits the sale, lease, or rental, by telephone or in person, and the buyer’s agreement or offer to purchase is made at a place other than the place of business of the person soliciting the same and that agreement or offer to purchase is there given to the seller or the seller’s representative. A transaction is not a personal solicitation sale if it is made pursuant to prior negotiations between the parties at a business establishment at a fixed location where goods or services are offered or exhibited for sale, lease, or rental.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol14">
       “Seller” means a person who makes a personal solicitation sale.

      <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol15">
       “Seller’s representative” means a person who makes a personal solicitation sale on behalf of a seller.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol16">
       “Telepromoter” means any person who, individually, through salespersons or agents, or through the use of an automatic dialing-announcing device initiates telephone contact with a consumer or who by written notice requests that the consumer contact the person by telephone and who represents one or more of the following:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol16a">
         That if the consumer buys one or more items from the telepromoter, the consumer will also receive additional or other items, whether or not of the same type as purchased, without further cost or at a cost which the seller states or implies is less than the regular price of those items.
        </li>
        <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol16b">
         That a consumer will receive a prize, premium, or gift if the telepromoter also encourages the consumer to do either of the following:
         <ol>
          <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol16b1">
           Purchase or rent any goods or services.
          </li>
          <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol16b2">
           Pay any money, including a delivery or handling charge.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t51c51-18s51-18-01ol16c">
         That the consumer has in any manner been specially selected to receive the written notice or the offer contained in the written notice.

      The commissioner may by order deny or revoke any exemption specified in section 51-19-04 with respect to the offer or sale of a specific franchise. No such order may be entered without appropriate prior notice to all interested parties, opportunity for hearing, and written findings of fact and conclusions of law, except that the commissioner may by order summarily deny or revoke any of the specified exemptions pending final determination of any proceeding under this section. Upon the entry of a summary order, the commissioner shall promptly notify all interested parties that it has been entered and the reasons therefor and that within fifteen days of the receipt of a written request the matter will be set down for hearing. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the commissioner, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the commissioner. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the commissioner, after notice of an opportunity for hearing to all interested persons, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination. No order under this section may operate retroactively. No person may be considered to have violated section 51-19-03 by reason of any offer or sale effected after the entry of an order under this section if the person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care would not have known, of the order.

No testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, compelled from an individual after a valid claim of the privilege against self-incrimination has been made may be used against the individual in any criminal proceeding, or in any proceeding to subject the individual to a penalty or forfeiture, except that the individual testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury or contempt committed in testifying.

In addition to any other remedy authorized by this chapter, the commissioner may impose by order and collect a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each violation against any person found in an administrative action to have violated this chapter.

       Any distributor of heavy construction equipment, repair parts, or both, who enters into a written contract with any retail dealer in heavy construction equipment, repair parts, or both, in which the retail dealer agrees to maintain a stock of heavy construction equipment, repair parts, or both, may not terminate, cancel, or fail to renew the contract without good cause.

       As used in this section, “good cause” means that the retail dealer has failed to comply with the requirements imposed upon the retail dealer by the terms of the written contract between the retail dealer and the distributor.

If the distributor fails to establish good cause for its termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal action, the distributor is liable for all special and general damages sustained by the retail dealer, including, but not limited to, the costs of the litigation and reasonable attorney’s fees for prosecuting the civil action. In addition, the retail dealer, where appropriate, is entitled to injunctive relief. The provisions of this section apply to contracts in effect on July 1, 1981, which have no expiration date and are continuing contracts, and to all other contracts entered into, amended, or renewed after June 30, 1981. This section does not apply to contracts in force and effect on June 30, 1981, which by their terms will terminate on a date subsequent to June 30, 1981. Those contracts are governed by the law as it existed prior to July 1, 1981.

      If any heavy construction equipment distributor fails or refuses, upon cancellation, termination, or nonrenewal of a contract by either a retail dealer or the distributor, to make payment to the retail dealer as required by section 51-20.1-02, the distributor is liable in a civil action brought by the retail dealer for one hundred percent of the net cost of the unused, complete heavy construction equipment, plus transportation charges paid by the retail dealer, and eighty-five percent of the current net price of repair parts, plus five percent of that current net price for handling and loading plus freight charges on the repair parts which have been paid by the retail dealer. A distributor is liable for equivalent amounts in a civil action if the distributor refuses to supply heavy construction equipment, repair parts, or both, to a retail dealer who has a contract dated after June 30, 1981, or a contract with no expiration date which is continuing in force on July 1, 1981.

        The issue of the legality of the arrest of plaintiff in a section 1983 action (42 USCS § 1983) who alleged that a retail security guard maliciously detained him on suspicion of shoplifting had been previously litigated where there was no suppression hearing at the state criminal trial, and a motion for dismissal for lack of probable cause clearly referred to whether there was sufficient evidence to go to the jury, not whether there was sufficient probable cause for arrest; therefore, the district court erred in finding defendant collaterally estopped from raising the issue of probable cause and in granting summary judgment for dismissal of the section 1983 claim and other pendent state claims.

An admission in violation of this subsection is not valid and is inadmissible in a civil or criminal action.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-21s51-21-05ol13">
       A conviction or plea of guilty for the theft is not a prerequisite to the bringing of a civil action under this section. However, if a criminal theft charge is filed against the individual, the merchant may not pursue civil damages until completion of the criminal action.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-21s51-21-05ol14">
       A parent or legal guardian of an unemancipated minor is not civilly liable under this section if it is determined by the court that one of the principal rationales for the shoplifting was a desire on the part of the minor to cause the minor’s parent or legal guardian to be liable under this section.

       The manufacturer shall provide information for consumer complaint remedies with each new farm machinery. Before taking action under this chapter, a consumer shall give written notification to the manufacturer of the need for the repair of the nonconformity to allow the manufacturer an opportunity to cure the alleged defect. The manufacturer immediately shall notify the consumer of a reasonably accessible repair facility of a franchised new farm machinery dealer to conform the new farm machinery to the express warranty. After delivery of the new farm machinery to an authorized repair facility by the consumer, the manufacturer shall conform the new farm machinery to the express warranty within thirty calendar days in appropriate seasonable use times and within sixty days in other times. The agriculture commissioner shall designate appropriate seasonal use times for all machinery covered by this chapter. Upon notification from the consumer that the new farm machinery has not been conformed to the express warranty, the manufacturer shall inform the consumer if an informal dispute settlement procedure has been established by the manufacturer. If prior notice by the manufacturer of an informal dispute settlement procedure has been given, no further notice is required. If any repair that may be required under any warranty takes more than fourteen working days to complete, the manufacturer shall supply at no cost a like piece of farm machinery for use by the consumer if requested by the consumer during the time of repair.

       “Initiate the transmission” refers to the action by the original sender of an electronic mail message, not to the action by any intervening interactive computer service that may handle or retransmit the message, unless the intervening interactive computer service assists in the transmission of an electronic mail message when the interactive computer service knows, or consciously avoids knowing, that the person initiating the transmission is engaged, or intends to engage, in any act or practice that violates chapter 51-15.

        Where the exemption under N.D.C.C. § 51-28-01(7) (now N.D.C.C. § 51-28-01(8)) of charitable telephone solicitations from the prohibition against solicitations to residents on the state’s do-not-call registry only applied if the charitable solicitation was made by a volunteer or employee of the charitable organization, the exclusion of professional solicitors from the exemption was not unconstitutional; the content-neutral statute significantly furthered the state’s interest in residential privacy, did not substantially limit charitable solicitations, did not preclude alternative means of solicitation, and was not overbroad.

      At any time that a consumer is required to receive a summary of rights required under 15 U.S.C. 1681g or under North Dakota law, the following notice shall be included:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       North Dakota Consumers Have the Right to Obtain a Security Freeze
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      You may obtain a security freeze on your consumer credit file at no charge to protect your privacy and ensure that credit is not granted in your name without your knowledge. You have a right to place a “security freeze” on your consumer credit file pursuant to North Dakota law.
     </p>
     <p>
      The security freeze will prohibit a consumer reporting agency from releasing any information in your consumer credit file without your express authorization or approval.
     </p>
     <p>
      The security freeze is designed to prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. When you place a security freeze on your credit file, within five business days you will be provided a personal identification number or password to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit file or to temporarily authorize the release of your credit report or credit score for a specific party, parties, or period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the consumer reporting agency and provide all of the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t51c51-33s51-33-12ol11">
       The unique personal identification number or password provided by the consumer reporting agency.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-33s51-33-12ol12">
       Proper identification to verify your identity.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-33s51-33-12ol13">
       The proper information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the credit report or the period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A consumer reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to lift temporarily a freeze shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request.
     </p>
     <p>
      A consumer reporting agency may charge you up to five dollars each time you freeze or temporarily lift the freeze, except a consumer reporting agency may not charge any amount to a victim of identity theft who has submitted a copy of a valid investigative report or complaint to a law enforcement agency about the unlawful use of the victim’s information by another person.
     </p>
     <p>
      A security freeze does not apply to circumstances where you have an existing account relationship and a copy of your report is requested by your existing creditor or its agents or affiliates for certain types of account review, collection, fraud control, or similar activities.
     </p>

      If you are actively seeking a new credit, loan, utility, or telephone account, you should understand that the procedures involved in lifting a security freeze may slow your own applications for credit. You should plan ahead and lift a freeze — either completely if you are shopping around, or specifically for a certain creditor — with enough advance notice before you apply for new credit for the lifting to take effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      You have a right to bring a civil action against someone who violates your rights under the credit reporting laws. The action can be brought against a consumer reporting agency or a user of your credit report.

       “Automatic renewal” means a plan or arrangement in which a paid subscription or purchasing agreement is automatically renewed for a period of more than one month at the end of a definite period for a subsequent period.
      </li>
      <li id="t51c51-37s51-37-01ol12">
       “Clear and conspicuous” means in a larger type than the surrounding text, in contrasting type, font, or color to the surrounding text of the same size, or set off from the surrounding text of the same size or symbols or other marks, in a manner that clearly calls attention to the language and makes the language readily apparent, readable, and understandable to the person to which the language is disclosed. In the case of an audio disclosure, “clear and conspicuous” means in a volume and cadence sufficient to be readily audible and understandable. A statement that contradicts or is inconsistent with any other information with which the statement is presented is not clear and conspicuous.
