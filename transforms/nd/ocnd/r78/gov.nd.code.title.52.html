The filing of a notice of unemployment must be deemed a request for determination of insured status if a current benefit year has not previously been established. In a combined-wage claim, the benefit year must be that of the paying state. However, if the establishment of a benefit year for a fifty-two-week period under this subsection would result in overlapping any quarter of that base period with the base period of a subsequent valid claim, the benefit year must be fifty-three weeks. A subsequent benefit year cannot be established until the expiration of the current benefit year.

        Job Service did not err in determining that a county was liable for unemployment benefits for its former employees even though they had left subsequent jobs where the county had elected the reimbursable method and the benefits were, thus, calculated from the date of the employees’ first claims for benefits which were against the county because the employees filed subsequent claims for benefits prior to expiration of the previously established benefit year.

        Effective July 17, 1991, subsection (17)(e) of this section was changed to incorporate the so-called “common law” test for when a contract for hire is to be deemed employment subject to the North Dakota Unemployment Compensation Law.

        Finding that vacuum cleaner “dealers” were employees of distributor subject to job insurance taxes and were not independent contractors was supported by the following factors: distributor directed that vacuum cleaners were to be sold through in-home demonstrations, the dealers’ services were integrated into the business, distributor’s continued success was dependent upon the efforts of its sales force, dealers were to perform services under the contract personally, many dealers had long-term continuing relationships with distributor, distributor furnished business cards and sales brochures to dealers, dealers did not have a significant investment, dealers did not in general have a significant risk of loss, dealers generally did not work as salespeople for other firms at the same time, dealers did not make their services available to the general public, and the contract between distributor and each of its dealers allowed either party to terminate it without liability.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Involuntary unemployment creates a hardship on the unemployed worker and the unemployed worker’s family and leads to a state of economic insecurity. Relief from problems of involuntary unemployment imposes a statewide burden of serious consequence to the people of the state of North Dakota which can best be met by unemployment insurance for the working person who becomes unemployed through no personal fault. The legislative assembly, therefore, declares that the public good and general welfare of the citizens of the state requires that for laboring people genuinely attached to the labor market there be a systematic and compulsory setting aside of financial reserves to be used as compensation for loss of wages during periods when they become unemployed through no fault of their own.

        This section and section 52-06-02 indicate that the legislature, in enunciating a public policy to provide unemployment compensation, intended to strike a balance between the rights of the unemployed worker who genuinely wants to work, contained in this section, and protection of the former employer from quits that have nothing to do with the employer or the employment, furthered by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t52c52-06s52-06-02" target="_self">52-06-02</a></cite>. Because unemployment compensation laws are remedial legislation, the balance should be struck in favor of the employee. Newland v. Job Serv. N.D., 460 N.W.2d 118, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

      The state of North Dakota recognizes its obligation to replace, and hereby pledges the faith of this state that funds will be provided in the future and be applied to the replacement of, any moneys received after July 1, 1941, from the social security board under title III of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 501 et seq.], any unencumbered balances relating to the administration of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law in the job service administration fund as of that date, any moneys thereafter granted to the state pursuant to the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act [48 Stat. 113; 29 U.S.C. 49-49k], and any moneys made available by the state or its political subdivisions and matched by such moneys granted to the state pursuant to the provisions of the Wagner-Peyser Act, which the social security board finds have been lost or have been expended because of any action or contingency for purposes other than or in amounts in excess of those found necessary for the proper administration of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law by the social security board. Such moneys must be replaced promptly by moneys appropriated for such purpose from the general funds of this state to the job service administration fund for expenditure as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t52c52-02s52-02-09" target="_self">52-02-09</a></cite>. The amount of money required for such replacement must be reported promptly by the bureau to the governor and the governor shall report the same to the legislative assembly. This section may not be construed to relieve the state of North Dakota of its obligation with respect to funds received prior to July 1, 1941, pursuant to the provisions of title III of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 501 et seq.].

      Moneys shall be requisitioned from this state’s account in the unemployment trust fund solely for the payment of benefits and for refunds pursuant to subdivision f of subsection 18 of section 52-01-01 and section 52-04-14, except that money credited to this state’s account pursuant to section 903 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1103], as amended, must be used exclusively as provided in subsection 3 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t52c52-03s52-03-07" target="_self">52-03-07</a></cite>. From time to time, the bureau shall requisition from the unemployment trust fund such amounts, not exceeding the amounts standing to this state’s account therein, as it deems necessary for the payment of benefits for a reasonable future period. Upon receipt thereof, the bureau shall deposit such moneys in the benefit account and shall pay benefits solely from such benefit account. Expenditures of such moneys in the benefit account and refunds from the clearing account are not subject to any provision of law requiring specific appropriations or other formal release by state officers of money in their custody. Any balance of moneys requisitioned from the unemployment trust fund which remains unclaimed or unpaid in the benefit account after the expiration of the period for which such sums were requisitioned, either must be deducted from estimates for, and may be utilized for the payment of benefits during succeeding periods, or, in the discretion of the bureau, must be redeposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States, to the credit of this state’s account in the unemployment trust fund as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t52c52-03s52-03-03" target="_self">52-03-03</a></cite>.

      The provisions of this chapter, to the extent that they relate to the unemployment trust fund, are operative only as long as such unemployment trust fund continues to exist and as the secretary of the treasury of the United States continues to maintain for this state a separate book account of all funds deposited therein by this state for benefit purposes, together with this state’s proportionate share of the earnings of such unemployment trust fund, from which no other state is permitted to make withdrawals. If and when such unemployment trust fund ceases to exist, or such separate book account is no longer maintained, all moneys, properties, or securities therein belonging to the unemployment compensation fund of this state must be transferred to the treasurer of the unemployment compensation fund, who shall hold, invest, transfer, sell, deposit, and release such moneys, properties, or securities in a manner approved by the bureau in accordance with the provisions of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law. Such moneys must be invested in bonds or other interest-bearing obligations of the United States or of the state of North Dakota. Such investments must be made so that all the assets of the fund shall always be readily convertible into cash when needed for the payment of benefits. The treasurer shall dispose of the securities or other properties belonging to the unemployment compensation fund only under the direction of the bureau.

       For each calendar year, the bureau separately shall estimate the amount of income needed to pay benefits and shall estimate the amount of income needed to reach a solvency balance in the unemployment insurance trust fund, that moves toward the solvency target amount as determined under this subsection. The solvency target is an average high-cost multiple of one. The average high-cost multiple is the number of years the bureau could pay unemployment compensation, based on the reserve ratio, if the bureau paid the compensation at a rate equivalent to the average benefit cost rate in the one calendar year during the preceding twenty calendar years and the two calendar years during the preceding ten calendar years in which the benefit cost rates were the highest. “Reserve ratio” means the ratio determined by dividing the balance in the trust fund reserve at the end of the calendar year by the total covered wages in the state for that year. “Benefit cost rate” means the rate determined by dividing the unemployment compensation benefits paid during a calendar year by the total covered wages in the state for that year. The computation of the reserve ratio and benefit cost rate must exclude the wages and unemployment compensation paid by employers covered under section 3309 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended [26 U.S.C. 3309].

       The initial trust fund solvency target must be achieved over a seven-year period from January 1, 2000. After the solvency target required by this section is reached, the calculation of the solvency target must be continued and, if the trust fund reserve as of December thirty-first of any year is less or greater than the solvency target, the rates must be adjusted so that one-fifth of the difference between the solvency target and the current trust fund reserve is estimated to be collected in the following rate year.
      </li>
      <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-05ol14">
       Progress toward achieving the solvency target is measured by reducing any difference between one and the average high-cost multiple of the state by an amount that is at least equal to the ratio of the number of years left to reach the solvency target to the difference between the trust fund reserve and the targeted amount. In setting tax rates, the amount of the trust fund reserve may not be allowed to fall below three hundred percent from a standard margin of error for the targeted amount of the trust fund reserve. The executive director may make reasonable adjustments to the tax rates set for a calendar year to prevent significant rate variations between calendar years.

       An employer’s reserve ratio is the difference between the six-year contributions paid by that employer on or before October thirty-first of any year, with respect to wages paid by that employer before October first of that same year, and the six-year benefits charged to that employer’s account before October first of that year, divided by the average annual payroll. Employers whose cumulative contributions exceed cumulative benefits must be assigned within the positive employer rate groups. Employers whose cumulative contributions are equal to or less than cumulative benefits must be assigned within the negative employer rate groups.
      </li>
      <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-06ol12">
       For each calendar year the bureau shall establish a schedule of positive employer rate groups within the positive employer minimum rate and the positive employer maximum rate determined under section 52-04-05. Each successive rate group for positive employer rate groups must be assigned a rate equal to one hundred twenty percent of the previous group’s rate with a minimum increase of one-tenth of one percent and a maximum increase of four-tenths of one percent. The number of rate groups in the positive employer schedule must be ten. For each calendar year the bureau shall establish a schedule of negative employer rate groups with the negative employer minimum rate and the negative employer maximum rate determined under section 52-04-05. Each successive rate group for negative employer rate groups must be assigned a rate equal to the previous group’s rate plus four-tenths of one percent. The number of rate groups in the negative employer schedule must be the number required to provide for a rate group at each four-tenths of one percent interval between the negative employer minimum rate and the negative employer maximum rate determined under section 52-04-05. All results calculated under this subsection must be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent.
      </li>
      <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-06ol13">
       Positive employers must be assigned to the rate in the positive employer rate schedule in the rank order of their reserve ratios, as determined in subsection 1, with the highest reserve ratio positive employers assigned to the first positive employer rate. Each successively ranked positive employer must be assigned to a rate within the positive employer rate schedule so that the first rate within the rate schedule is assigned sixty percent of the positive employer’s prior year’s taxable wages and each of the remaining nine rates within the rate schedule are assigned the same proportion of the remaining forty percent of the positive employer’s prior year’s taxable wages. Negative employers must be assigned to the rate in the negative employer rate schedule in the rank order of their reserve ratios, as determined in subsection 1, with the highest reserve ratio negative employers assigned to the first negative employer rate. Each successively ranked negative employer must be assigned to a rate within the negative employer rate schedule so that each rate within the rate schedule is assigned the same proportion of the negative employer’s prior year’s taxable wages.

That amount must be credited to the employer’s separate account. The employer’s rate must be recomputed with the amount paid pursuant to this subsection included only, except as allowed by subdivision b, if that amount was paid by April thirtieth of that year. Payments may not be refunded or used as credit in the payment of contributions.

         An employer that enters a contract with a staffing service, other than a temporary staffing service, may make the payments authorized by this subsection at any time during the rate year and the agency will determine if that payment is adequate to allow the staffing service to comply with subsection 3 of section 52-04-24; however, the employer’s tax rate will remain in effect for the remainder of the tax year. The agency will deposit any payment received pursuant to this subsection immediately and will credit it to the employer’s separate account, but the agency will apply the payment to the calculation of the employer’s tax rate for the following rate year. In order to take advantage of this subdivision and subsection 3 of section 52-04-24, an employer may not be delinquent in its unemployment insurance tax payments on the date on which the payment authorized by this subdivision is made.

       If an employer has a quarterly taxable payroll in excess of fifty thousand dollars and at least three times its established average annual payroll or the average annual payroll is zero, and the employer’s cumulative lifetime reserve balance is positive, then the tax rate for that employer is ninety percent of the positive employer maximum rate in effect that year or a rate of one percent, whichever is greater, beginning the first day of the calendar quarter in which it occurred and for the remainder of the calendar year. If the employer’s cumulative lifetime reserve balance is negative, then the tax rate for that employer is the negative employer maximum rate of contribution in effect that year, beginning the first day of the calendar quarter in which it occurred and for the remainder of the calendar year.

       Any project in this state with an estimated construction cost of at least fifty million dollars which is planned to be completed or discontinued within a period of seven years is subject to this section. The general or prime contractor, or the owner in those situations in which there is no general or prime contractor, of a project that meets the criteria specified under this section shall post the bond or irrevocable letter of credit required in subsection 2 before commencement of construction work on the project and shall report annually, within thirty days of the anniversary date the project becomes subject to this section, to the bureau any change in the construction costs of projects subject to this section.

      <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-06.1ol12">
       If the bureau determines that the project is or will be within the criteria stated by this section, the bureau shall require the general or prime contractor, or the owner in those situations in which there is no general or prime contractor, for whom the project is being constructed, on behalf of each employing unit, excluding design and engineering firms, to post a bond executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the state or an irrevocable letter of credit from a federal deposit insurance corporation insured state or nationally chartered bank authorized to do business in the state which will insure payment for all benefits claimed by employees of all employing units working on the project. The bureau may adjust the amount of bond or irrevocable letter of credit required under this subsection to cover any significant increases or decreases in project construction costs reported by the general or prime contractor or owner. If any general or prime contractor or owner fails to comply with this subsection, the bureau may apply to any court of this state within the jurisdiction in which the contractor or owner is found, located, or transacts business to obtain an order to compel the general or prime contractor or owner to post the required bond or irrevocable letter of credit required under this subsection. Any failure to obey an order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of court.

       The amount of bond or irrevocable letter of credit must be the difference between the estimated benefits paid and estimated contributions, multiplied by fifty percent. The estimation of contributions expected must be made as follows: multiply the current year’s positive employer minimum rate times the current year’s taxable wage base times the estimated number of employees on the project using figures from project plans, times the number of years between the start date and the estimated completion date of the project. The estimation of benefits paid must be made as follows: multiply the estimated number of employees, from the project plans, times the current year’s maximum weekly benefit amount times the duration, twelve weeks for the first year and twelve weeks for subsequent years, times the number of years between the start date and the completion date rounded up to the next whole number.

If the total amount paid to the employees of the unit or units exceeds the total amount of contributions collected from the units under the North Dakota unemployment compensation law, the general or prime contractor, or the owner in those situations in which there is no general or prime contractor, shall pay the total amount of benefits paid to the employees of the units which exceeded the total amount of contributions collected from the unit or units. If the general or prime contractor, or the owner in those situations in which there is no general or prime contractor, does not pay the payment requirement, job service North Dakota shall collect the payment from the surety company that executed the surety bond or bank that issued the irrevocable letter of credit. The general or prime contractor, or the owner in those situations in which there is no general or prime contractor, shall remain liable for any amount of benefits paid to the employees working on the project which exceeds the amount of contributions collected from the employers who worked on the project which is not covered by the amount of the bond or irrevocable letter of credit.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the following applies regarding assignment of penalty tax rates and transfers and acquisitions of businesses:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-08.2ol11">
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-08.2ol11a">
         If an employer transfers all or a part of its trade or business to another employer and at the time of the transfer there is substantially common ownership, management, or control of the two employers, the unemployment experience attributable to the transferred trade or business is transferred to the employer to which the business is transferred. The rates of both employers must be recalculated and made effective on the first day of the quarter in which the transfer took effect. The transfer of any of the employer’s workforce to another employer is considered a transfer of trade or business under this subsection if, as a result of the transfer, the transferring employer no longer performs the trade or business in which the transferred workforce was engaged, and the trade or business is performed by the employer to which the workforce was transferred.
        </li>
        <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-08.2ol11b">
         If, following a transfer of experience under subdivision a, the agency determines that a substantial purpose of the transfer of trade or business was to obtain a reduced unemployment insurance tax rate, the experience ratings of the employers involved must be combined into a single account and a single unemployment insurance tax rate must be assigned to that account.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-08.2ol12">
       If a person, who at the time of acquisition is not an employer under this title, acquires the trade or business of an employer, the unemployment experience of the acquired business may not be transferred to that person if the agency finds that the person acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower unemployment insurance tax rate. Instead, the person must be assigned the applicable new employer rate calculated under section 52-04-05. In determining whether the business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower unemployment insurance tax rate, the agency shall use objective factors that may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long the business enterprise was continued, and whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted before acquisition.
      </li>
      <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-08.2ol13">
       If a person knowingly acts or attempts to transfer or acquire a trade or business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower unemployment insurance tax rate or knowingly violates any other provision of this chapter related to determining the assignment of an unemployment insurance tax rate, or if a person knowingly advises another person in a way that results in a violation of those provisions, the person is subject to the civil penalties provided in this subsection.
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-08.2ol13a">
         If the person is an employer, the employer must be assigned, in lieu of that employer’s experience rate, the highest rate assignable under this chapter for the rate year during which the violation or attempted violation occurred and the three rate years immediately following that rate year. However, if the employer’s experience rate is already at the highest rate for any year of that four-year period or if the amount of increase in the person’s experience rate imposed under this subdivision would be less than two percent for any year of the four-year period, the penalty unemployment insurance tax rate for the year must be determined by adding a rate increment of two percent of taxable wages to the calculated experience rate.

        <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-08.2ol13b">
         If the person is not an employer, the person is subject to a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five thousand dollars. Any civil penalty collected must be deposited in the penalty and interest account established under section 52-04-22.

      The bureau shall promptly make a determination and notify each employer of the employer’s rate of contributions as determined for each ensuing year by the end of the first full week of December, but not later than December tenth, of the preceding year. The rate of contributions must be computed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

For purposes of this section, an employer was not a party to any such proceeding if notice of the determination, redetermination, or decision and the employer’s right to appeal the determination, redetermination, or decision was not mailed or personally delivered to the employer.

        Penalty Tax Rate Properly Assigned.

      <p>
       District court properly affirmed Job Service North Dakota's decision that an employer did not file a valid appeal and the agency's determination assigning the employer a penalty tax rate for unemployment insurance was final because the employer was a corporation that could only act through an agent, the attorney who filed an electronic appeal was not employed by the employer, was not an officer or on the employer's board of directors, he had not applied for pro hac vice admission, applied legal skill and knowledge to the facts of the case, and his actions were not preparatory work, and the employer did not establish all of the elements of estoppel.

The clerk shall enter and docket the certificate in the same manner as a judgment that directs the payment of money. The certificate has the force and effect of a judgment of the district court. The certificate is a lien on all the real property, except the homestead, of every person named, which the person may have in any county in which the certificate is docketed at the time of docketing or which the person thereafter acquires in the county, for ten years from the time of docketing. The certificate may be renewed in the same manner and with the same effect as a judgment that directs the payment of money. Execution of the certificate is issuable in the same manner as provided for execution of judgments.

     <p>
      Two or more employers that have become liable for payments in lieu of contributions may file a joint application to the bureau for the establishment of a group account for the purpose of sharing the cost of benefits paid that are attributable to service in the employ of such employers. Each such application must identify and authorize a group representative to act as the group’s agent for the purposes of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law. Upon the approval of the application, the bureau shall establish a group account for such employers effective as of the beginning of the calendar quarter in which it receives the application and shall notify the group’s representative of the effective date of the account. Such account must remain in effect for not less than two years and thereafter until terminated at the discretion of the bureau or upon application by the group. Upon establishment of the account, each member of the group is liable for payments in lieu of contributions with respect to each calendar quarter in the amount that bears the same ratio to the total benefits paid in such quarter that are attributable to service performed in the employ of all members of the group as the total wages paid for service in employment by such member in such quarter bear to the total wages paid during such quarter for service performed in the employ of all members of the group. The bureau shall prescribe such regulations as it deems necessary with respect to applications for establishment, maintenance, and termination of group accounts that are authorized by this section, for addition of new members to, and withdrawal of active members from, such accounts, and for the determination of the amounts that are payable under this section by members of the group and the time and manner of such payments.

       If a staffing service exclusively provides temporary staffing services, the staffing service is considered to be the employee’s employer and the staffing service shall pay unemployment insurance taxes at the staffing service’s unemployment insurance tax rate. If a staffing service provides temporary and long-term employee staffing services, the staffing service is subject to the reporting and tax requirements associated with the type of employee provided to the client company.

         Notify the agency of each client company’s name and unemployment insurance account number and the date the staffing service began providing services to the client company. The staffing service shall provide the agency with the information required under this subdivision upon entering an agreement with a client company, but no later than fifteen days from the effective date of the written agreement.

       For the purposes of long-term employee staffing services provided by a staffing service, upon authorization of the agency, the staffing service may be considered to be the employee’s employer and the staffing service shall pay unemployment insurance taxes at the staffing service’s unemployment insurance tax rate. The agency may not make an authorization under this subsection unless one of the following requirements is met:

             Notifies the agency that such application would, if the staffing service’s tax rate were applied to those same wages, cause a reduction in the tax due on those wages which does not exceed five hundred dollars.

           If the reduction under paragraph 1 exceeds five hundred dollars, at the written request of the staffing service, the agency may make a written determination that it is appropriate to allow the staffing service to use the staffing service’s unemployment insurance tax rate. The agency shall respond to a request under this paragraph within fifteen days of receiving all required information.

         The staffing service includes in its contract with the client company a requirement that if the client company’s unemployment insurance tax rate is higher than the staffing service’s tax rate, the client will arrange to make payment to the agency, pursuant to subsection 4 of section 52-04-06, in the amount necessary to cause the client company’s unemployment insurance tax rate should it be recomputed to be determined by the agency to be equivalent to the staffing service’s unemployment insurance tax rate. Before the agency makes an authorization under this subdivision, the agency actually must receive payment of the amount required to cause the determination that the client company has complied with this subdivision.
        </li>
        <li id="t52c52-04s52-04-24ol13c">
         The staffing service demonstrates to the agency that the staffing service has entered an agreement with a client company that has an unemployment insurance tax rate that is, at the time of execution of the contract, equal to or lower than the staffing service’s tax rate.

       If a staffing service enters a contract with a client company that has an unemployment insurance tax rate that is lower than the staffing service’s tax rate, the agency shall determine the following year’s tax rate for the staffing service by calculating a blended reserve ratio using the proportion of that client company’s total wages paid for up to the previous six years to the total wages paid for up to the previous six years for all of that staffing service’s client companies whose furnished workers are considered the staffing service’s employees for unemployment insurance tax purposes pursuant to subsection 3.

       Both a staffing service and client company are considered employers for the purposes of this title. Both parties to a contract between a staffing service and a client company are jointly liable for delinquent unemployment insurance taxes, and the agency may seek to collect such delinquent taxes, and any penalties and interest due, from either party. The agency shall send notices of rate determinations annually to the staffing service. This chapter does not modify or impair any other provisions of the contract between the staffing service and the client company not relating to the requirements of this subsection concerning liability for payment of taxes on the wages paid to workers furnished by the staffing service to the client company, and the means of determining the tax rate to be applied to those wages. Any report that relates to the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [68A Stat. 439; 26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.] which is required to be submitted to the federal internal revenue service regarding a staffing service must be submitted with the employer identification number of the staffing service.

       The agency shall determine whether a person is a staffing service. If the agency determines a person is a staffing service, the agency may further determine if the person is a temporary staffing service. The agency’s determination must be issued in writing, and within fifteen days of the date of issuance of that determination, a person aggrieved by that determination may appeal that determination. The appeal must be heard in the same manner and with the same possible results as all other administrative appeals under this title. In making a determination under this subsection, the agency may consider:

       The individual has registered for work and thereafter continued to complete all assigned services and report to a local office as required in accordance with such regulations as the bureau may prescribe, except that the bureau may, by regulation, waive or alter either or both of the requirements of this subsection as to individuals attached to regular jobs and as to such other types of cases or situations with respect to which it finds that compliance with such requirements would be oppressive, or would be inconsistent with the purposes of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law; provided, that no such regulation shall conflict with section 52-06-03;

         That notwithstanding any other provisions in this section, no otherwise eligible individual may be denied benefits for any week because the individual is in training with the approval of the bureau by reason of the application of provisions of this subsection relating to availability for work and to active search for work, or the provisions of subsection 3 of section 52-06-02 relating to disqualification for benefits for failure to apply for, or a refusal to accept, suitable work; and

       <p>
        A claimant who has established a bona fide connection with the labor market by continued employment, has performed services for an employer, and has, upon becoming unemployed due to wintry weather, fully complied with the conditions set forth in this section, is entitled to unemployment compensation benefits even though he is also engaged in a farming enterprise for himself during his free time. Beck v. Workmen's Compensation Bureau, 141 N.W.2d 784, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1966); Wirth v.

        Where the issue of whether the worker had good cause in not filing claim cards for unemployment benefits remained unresolved on the record, remand to Job Service was required. Powers v.

           Can demonstrate that the individual has earned remuneration for personal services in employment from and after the date of the unemployment compensation claim filing, equivalent to at least eight times the individual’s weekly benefit amount as determined under section 52-06-04; and

         A temporary employee of a temporary help firm is deemed to have left employment voluntarily if the employee does not contact the temporary help firm for reassignment before filing for benefits. Failure to contact the temporary help firm is not deemed a voluntary leaving of employment unless the claimant was advised of the obligation to contact the temporary help firm upon completion of an assignment and advised that unemployment benefits may be denied for failure to contact the temporary help firm. As used in this subsection, “temporary employee” means an employee assigned to work for a client of a temporary help firm; and “temporary help firm” means a firm that hires that firm’s own employees and assigns these employees to a client to support or supplement the client’s workforce in a work situation such as employee absence, temporary skill shortage, seasonal workload, a special assignment, and a special project.

        <li id="t52c52-06s52-06-02ol11c">
         This subsection does not apply if job service North Dakota determines that the individual in an active claim filing status accepted work which the individual could have refused with good cause under section 52-06-36 and terminated such employment with the same good cause and within the first ten weeks after starting work.

         This subsection does not apply if the individual left employment or remains away from employment following illness or injury upon a physician’s written notice or order; no benefits may be paid under this exception unless the employee has notified the employer of the physician’s requirement and has offered service for suitable work to the employer upon the individual’s capability of returning to employment. This exception does not apply unless the individual’s capability of returning to employment and offer of service for suitable work to the employer occurs within sixty days of the last day of work. However, the cost of any benefits paid under this exception may not be charged against the account of the employer, other than a reimbursing employer, from whom the individual became separated as a result of the illness or injury. Job service North Dakota may request and designate a licensed physician to provide a second opinion regarding the claimant’s qualification; however, no individual may be charged fees of any kind for the cost of such second opinion.

         For the purpose of this subsection, “most recent employment” means employment with any employer for whom the claimant last worked and voluntarily quit without good cause attributable to the employer or with any employer, in insured work, for whom the claimant last worked and earned wages equal to or exceeding eight times the individual’s weekly benefit amount.
        </li>
        <li id="t52c52-06s52-06-02ol11h">
         This subsection does not apply if the individual leaves work which is two hundred road miles [321.87 kilometers] or more, as measured on a one-way basis, from the individual’s home to accept work which is less than two hundred road miles [321.87 kilometers] from the individual’s home provided the work is a bona fide job offer with a reasonable expectation of continued employment.

        <li id="t52c52-06s52-06-02ol11i">
         This subsection does not apply if the individual voluntarily leaves most recent employment to accept a bona fide job offer with a base-period employer who laid off the individual and with whom the individual has a demonstrated job attachment. For the purposes of this exception, “demonstrated job attachment” requires earnings in each of six months during the five calendar quarters before the calendar quarter in which the individual files the claim for benefits.

After receiving a claim for unemployment insurance benefits for which the individual identifies domestic violence, stalking, or sexual assault as the reason for separation, job service North Dakota shall notify the most recent employer of the reason for separation provided by the individual.

        Section 52-01-05 declares a public policy of this state supporting a system of unemployment compensation. Tempering that public policy is this section which limits the availability of benefits. Lipp v. Job Serv. N.D., 468 N.W.2d 133, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        In applying this provision, Job Service must first decide the factual issue of whether an employee quit or was fired, and a finding that the employee voluntarily quit will render that employee ineligible for benefits unless he shows good cause attributable to the employer, another factual issue.

        District court did not err in affirming the denial of unemployment benefits because a reasoning mind could rationally find that an employee voluntarily quit without showing good cause attributable to the employe; the employee relinquished her title and duties as interim program director but intended to keep her position as coach, but the gym board of directors informed the employee no coaching positions were available aside from that associated with the program director position.

        Job Service North Dakota properly determined that an unemployment benefits applicant did not make a reasonable effort to preserve her employment relationship; the applicant claimed that she informed her employer that she would have to quit her job if she were required to perform any duties outside the scope of her license, but the appeals referee found that she did not do so.

        Employee engaged in misconduct disqualifying her from unemployment benefits where a reasoning mind could reasonably conclude that the employee told the staffing agency representative that she was a shift supervisor and that she directed the representative to begin the process of hiring her brother; the employee knowingly violated the employer’s no-hiring policy and her conduct was more than an error in judgment as the employee knew her conduct was inappropriate and her actions displayed an intentional disregard of the standard of behavior her employer had the right to expect from her.

        Evidence produced in a hearing before the unemployment bureau that there were at least 16 instances when the applicant, a store cashier, was warned that the applicant’s job performance fell below the level expected of employees showed that a preponderance of the evidence under N.D.C.C. § 28-32-46 and N.D.C.C. § 28-32-49 supported the unemployment bureau’s decision that the applicant’s employment was terminated for misconduct. As a result, the applicant was ineligible pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 52-06-02(2) to receive unemployment benefits.

        In reviewing the factual basis of an administrative agency decision, the court does not make independent findings of fact or substitute its judgment for that of the agency. The court determines only whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have determined that the factual conclusions reached were proved by the weight of the evidence from the entire record, and an agency’s findings will be held to be adequate when the court is able to understand the basis of the agency’s decision.

        Although advance warning to employee that he may be discharged for his behavior is a factor to be considered in determining if the discharge is for misconduct, such warning is not a prerequisite to a discharge for misconduct.

        It is employer’s burden to establish by a preponderance of evidence that employee’s acts constitute misconduct which results in a disqualification of unemployment benefits. Schadler v. Job Serv. N.D., 361 N.W.2d 254, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        “Misconduct” is conduct evincing such wilful or wanton disregard of an employer’s interests as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee. Blueshield v. Job Serv. N.D., 392 N.W.2d 70, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 384</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        Mere inefficiency, unsatisfactory conduct, failure in good performance as the result of inability or incapacity, inadvertencies or ordinary negligence in isolated instances, or good faith errors in judgment or discretion are not to be deemed “misconduct” within the meaning of the section. Marion v. Job Serv. N.D., 470 N.W.2d 609, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 113</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>
        It is only where the deliberate disregard of those standards of behavior evinces or amounts to a willful or wanton disregard of an employer’s interests, that the conduct in question can be deemed “misconduct.” Where the conduct in question is an isolated incident, the connection between the conduct and the impact or potential impact on the employer’s interests must be especially close. Hins v. Western, 484 N.W.2d 491, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 88</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Under section 52-06-02(2), a person is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits if he or she was “discharged for misconduct in connection with his or her most recent employment.” The term “misconduct” has not been defined by North Dakota Unemployment Compensation law leaving it to the judiciary to give meaning to the term.

       <p>
        An employer’s policy need not be explicit and in writing for an employee’s actions to constitute misconduct if the employee knew or should have known that the conduct involved was inappropriate and the employee’s actions evinced an intentional and substantial disregard of the standard of behavior which his employer had the right to expect from him.

        Misconduct is a mixed question of fact and law, thus, for the agency’s decision to be upheld, the evidence must support its findings of fact which, in turn, must sustain its conclusion regarding misconduct.

        Where employer admitted respondent had been a good employee, her decision not to work was at most an isolated instance of bad judgment; for a single ill-advised decision to be disqualifying conduct, the decision must violate either an important employer interest or explicit policy and under this standard, employee’s single unexcused absence was not misconduct.

        Whether an employee’s behavior is misconduct depends in part on the nature of the work and presents a mixed question of fact and law and Supreme Court review of a mixed question of fact and law involves a determination of whether the evidence supports the agency’s findings of fact and, in turn, whether those findings of fact sustain the agency’s conclusion; on disputed facts, Supreme Court will defer to the agency’s findings and consider only whether a reasoning mind could have reasonably determined that the factual conclusions were proved by a preponderance of the evidence. When the agency’s conclusion of law regarding misconduct is based on undisputed facts and contradictory inferences cannot reasonably be drawn from the undisputed facts, the Supreme Court will review that conclusion anew.

        Where a claimant has adequately informed the agency of all her asserted reasons for quitting, she is entitled to have job service consider each of those reasons.

      However, if that amount is less than the “minimum weekly benefit amount” the individual is monetarily ineligible for benefits. The “minimum weekly benefit amount” is forty-three dollars. The “maximum weekly benefit amount” is sixty-two percent of the “average weekly wage”, rounded to the next lower multiple of one dollar if not a multiple of one dollar. However, if on October first of any calendar year this state’s average contribution rate is below the nationwide average for the preceding calendar year, the maximum weekly benefit amount is sixty-five percent of the “average weekly wage”, rounded to the next lower multiple of one dollar if not a multiple of one dollar.

       District court properly affirmed a decision by Job Service determining that an employee was overpaid unemployment benefits and requiring him to refund those previously paid benefits because Job Service’s determination became final when he failed to appeal from that determination, Job Service’s statutory application was not subject to collateral attack, and as the employee failed to submit a request to the Collections Unit, which might grant the request in its discretion, the issue was not ripe for review.

      Each eligible individual who is unemployed with respect to any week must be paid with respect to such week a benefit in an amount equal to the individual’s weekly benefit amount less that part of the wages, if any, payable to the individual with respect to such week which is in excess of sixty percent of the individual’s weekly benefit amount. Such benefit, if not a multiple of one dollar, must be computed to the next higher multiple of one dollar. For the purposes of this section, wages are payable with respect to the weeks for which they were reasonably intended to be payable, irrespective of whether services were performed in those weeks.

      Whenever any claim for benefits under the North Dakota unemployment compensation law involves the application of the provisions of subsection 4 of section 52-06-02, the examiner handling the claim, if so directed by the bureau, shall transmit such claim promptly to the appeals referee for the purpose of making a determination upon the issues involved under that section or upon such claim. The appeals referee shall make the determination on the claim after such investigation as the appeals referee deems necessary and after affording the parties entitled to notice an opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with the provisions of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law with respect to hearings and determinations of the appeal tribunals. The parties must be notified promptly of the determination, together with the reasons therefor, in the event of the denial of the claim. Such determination must be deemed to be the final decision on the claim, unless within seven days of the mailing of the notice to a party’s last-known address, or in the absence of such mailing, within ten days after the delivery of such notice, an appeal is filed with the bureau.

      Notwithstanding any other provisions of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law, the bureau, by regulation, may prescribe that the existence of unemployment, the eligibility for benefits, and the amount of benefits shall be determined for that portion of the week occurring before or after a separation from, or securing of, work in the case of any otherwise eligible claimant who, within a week of unemployment, is separated from or secures work on a regular attachment basis. Such rules must be reasonably calculated to secure general results substantially similar to those provided by the North Dakota unemployment compensation law with respect to weeks of unemployment.

The bureau shall notify promptly the parties to any proceeding before it of its decision, including its findings and conclusions in support thereof. Such decision is final unless within thirty days after the mailing of a notice thereof to the party’s last-known address, or in the absence of such mailing, within thirty days after service of such notice, a proceeding for a judicial review is initiated pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t52c52-06s52-06-27" target="_self">52-06-27</a></cite>. Upon a denial by the bureau of an application for appeal from the decision of the appeal tribunal, the decision of the appeal tribunal must be deemed to be a decision of the bureau within the meaning of this section for the purposes of judicial review and is subject to judicial review within the time and in the manner provided with respect to decisions of the bureau, except that the time for initiating such review must run from the date of notice of the order by the bureau denying the application for appeal.

The bureau shall adopt reasonable regulations governing the manner of filing appeals and the conduct of hearings and appeals, consistent with the provisions of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law. When the same or substantially similar evidence is relevant and material to the matters in issue in claims by more than one individual or in claims by a single individual with respect to two or more weeks of unemployment, the same time and place for considering each such claim may be fixed, hearings thereon jointly conducted, a single record of the proceedings made, and evidence adduced with respect to one proceeding considered as introduced in the others when, in the judgment of the appeal tribunal having jurisdiction of the proceeding, such consolidation would not be prejudicial to any party. No person may participate on behalf of the bureau in any case in which the person has a direct or indirect interest.

      Any right, fact, or matter in issue directly passed upon or necessarily involved in a determination or redetermination which has become final, or which has become final following a decision or appeal under the North Dakota unemployment compensation law, is conclusive for all the purposes of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law as between the bureau, the claimant, and all employing units who had notice of such determination, redetermination, or decisions. Any determination, redetermination, or decision as to rights to benefits which has become final and conclusive in accordance with this section is not subject to collateral attack by any employing unit, irrespective of notice. As used in this section, “collateral attack by any employing unit” includes a collateral attack by a reimbursing or contributory base-period employer on a final and conclusive determination of benefits involving a different employer provided that an employer challenging the propriety of charging any benefits paid as a result of a final determination, redetermination, or decision is entitled to receive data and information from job service North Dakota concerning the monetary basis for the claimant’s right to the benefits at issue. Provided further, that at any hearing on the challenge, job service North Dakota is not required to call or subpoena the claimant or the claimant’s last or most recent employer as a witness.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The final decisions of the bureau or of an appeal tribunal and the principles of law declared by it in arriving at such decisions, unless expressly or impliedly overruled by a later decision of the bureau or by a court of competent jurisdiction, are binding upon the bureau and any appeal tribunal in subsequent proceedings which involve similar questions of law. In any subsequent proceeding, if the job insurance division or any appeal tribunal has serious doubt as to the correctness of any principle so declared, the division or appeal tribunal may certify its findings of fact in the case, together with the question of law involved, to the bureau, which after giving notice and reasonable opportunity for hearing upon the law to all parties to such proceeding thereupon shall certify to the division, or to the appeal tribunal, and the parties, its answer to the questions submitted. If the question thus certified to the bureau arises in connection with a claim for benefits, the bureau in its discretion may remove to itself the entire proceedings on such claim, and after proceeding in accordance with the requirements of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law with respect to proceedings before an appeal tribunal, shall render its decision upon the entire claim. Any decision made under the North Dakota unemployment compensation law after the removal of the proceedings upon a claim to the bureau has the effect of a decision under section 52-06-19 and is subject to judicial review within the same time and to the same extent.

      A party to proceedings before the bureau may obtain a judicial review of the decision of the bureau by filing a petition for review within thirty days after the date of mailing the bureau’s decision to the party at the party’s last-known address, or in the absence of mailing, within thirty days after delivery of the decision to the party. The petition for review must be filed in the district court of the county in which the petitioner resides, must be verified, and must state the grounds upon which review is sought. All other parties to the proceeding before the bureau must be parties respondent. The bureau is deemed to be a party to any such proceeding. If the bureau is a party respondent, the petition must be served upon it by leaving with it or its chairman, or any other representative as it may designate for that purpose, as many copies of the petition as there are respondents. With its answer or petition, the bureau shall certify and file with the court a verified copy of the record of the case, including all documents and papers and a transcript of all testimony taken in the matter, together with the bureau’s findings, conclusions, and decision therein. Upon the filing of a petition for review by the bureau or upon the service of the petition upon it, the bureau forthwith shall send by registered mail to each other party to the proceeding a copy of such petition and such mailing is deemed to be completed service upon all such parties. In any proceeding under this section the finding of the bureau as to the facts, if supported by evidence and in the absence of fraud, is conclusive and the review by the court must be confined to questions of law. Such proceedings must be heard by the court and must be given precedence over all other civil cases except cases arising under the workforce safety and insurance statute of this state. An appeal may be taken from the decision of the district court to the supreme court of this state in the same manner as is provided in civil cases. Upon the final termination of such judicial proceeding, the bureau shall enter an order in accordance with the mandate of the court.

      Benefits must be promptly paid in accordance with a determination or redetermination regardless of any appeal or pending appeal. If a determination allowing benefits is affirmed in any amount by an appeals referee or is so affirmed by the bureau or if a decision of an appeals referee allowing benefits is affirmed in any amount by the bureau, such benefits must be promptly paid regardless of any further appeal and no injunction, supersedeas, stay, or other writ or process suspending the payment of such benefits may be issued by any court but if such decision is finally reversed, no employer’s account may be charged with benefits so paid pursuant to the erroneous determination, except on those employer accounts which make payments in lieu of contributions, and benefits may not be paid for any subsequent weeks of unemployment involved in such reversal. Benefits due and payable to a deceased or judicially declared incompetent person may be paid in accordance with such regulations as the bureau shall prescribe, to the person or persons, payment to whom the bureau finds would effectuate the purposes of the North Dakota unemployment compensation law. Such regulations need not conform to the statutes applicable to the descent and distribution of decedents’ estates. A receipt from the person or persons to whom the bureau makes payment shall fully discharge the fund and the bureau from liability for such benefits.

      A claimant may not be charged fees by the bureau or by any court or officer thereof in any proceeding under this chapter. Any party in any proceeding before the bureau may be represented by counsel or other duly authorized agent. A claimant’s attorney’s fees for representation in district court must be paid by the bureau, in an amount determined to be reasonable by the bureau, if the claimant finally prevails; however, the bureau may not pay attorney’s fees if the claimant’s attorney is employed by or contracting with a legal services organization funded totally or in part by public funds. A claimant’s attorney’s fees are those fees charged to the claimant by the attorney and which would otherwise be payable by the claimant to the attorney. The bureau may not pay attorney’s fees for representation in any proceeding before the bureau or its representatives.

    Recovery and recoupment — Penalty.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who has received any amount of benefits under the North Dakota unemployment compensation law to which the person is not entitled shall be liable to refund to the bureau for the fund the amount so paid or to have such amount deducted from any future benefits payable to the person under the North Dakota unemployment compensation law or the unemployment compensation law of another state or the federal government following a finding that such payment occurred. Such findings shall have become final and shall specify the reason for such finding, the week or weeks for which such benefits were paid, and the amount of benefits so paid. The bureau, in its discretion, may release such person from liability to refund when it finds that recovery would be contrary to equity and good conscience. Amounts determined collectible may be so collected by civil action in the name of the bureau. If the bureau has found that the individual has made a false statement for the purpose of obtaining unemployment compensation benefits to which the individual was not lawfully entitled, the bureau shall assess a monetary penalty of fifteen percent of the amount of unemployment compensation benefits overpaid. The penalty must be applied to all forms of state and federal unemployment compensation and the federally mandated penalty amounts collected must be deposited in the state unemployment compensation fund. Amounts unpaid on the date on which they are due and payable, as determined by the bureau, may bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from and after that date until payment plus accrued interest is received by the bureau. However, no interest may be assessed for the first one hundred eighty days on any overpayment when the bureau has found that the individual did not make a false statement to obtain benefits to which the individual was not lawfully entitled.

     <p>
      In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual and in determining the existence of good cause for voluntarily leaving the individual’s work under subsections 1 and 3 of section 52-06-02, there must be considered among other factors, and in addition to those enumerated in this section, the degree of risk involved to the individual’s health, safety, and morals, the individual’s physical fitness and prior training, the individual’s experience and prior earnings, the length of the individual’s unemployment, the individual’s prospects for obtaining work in the individual’s customary occupation, the distance of available work from the individual’s residence, and the prospects for obtaining local work. However, any work paying wages equal to the maximum weekly benefit amount must be determined suitable for an individual who has filed for and received benefit payments for eighteen consecutive weeks; provided, that consideration must be given to the degree of risk involved to the individual’s health, safety, morals, the individual’s physical fitness, and the distance of the work from the individual’s residence. No work may be deemed suitable and benefits may not be denied under the North Dakota unemployment compensation law to any otherwise eligible individual for refusing to accept new work under any of the following conditions:

     <p>
      In order to extend to employees of the state and political subdivisions within the state, and to the dependents and survivors of such employees, the basic protection accorded to others by the old-age and survivor insurance system embodied in the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], it is hereby declared the policy of the legislative assembly, subject to the limitations of this chapter, that such steps be taken as to provide such protection to employees of the state and political subdivisions within the state on as broad a basis as is permitted under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.]. It is the policy also of the legislative assembly that the protection afforded employees in positions covered by a retirement system on the date an agreement under this chapter is made applicable to service performed in such positions, or receiving periodic benefits under such retirement system at such time, will not be impaired as a result of making the agreement so applicable or as a result of legislative enactment in anticipation thereof.

       Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-10-05 and 52-10-07, with respect to the employees of any political subdivision who are under a locally administered retirement system in existence prior to April 23, 1957, including the North Dakota teachers’ insurance and retirement fund for the purposes of this section, the governor is empowered to authorize a referendum for a divided retirement system as provided by section 218 of title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 418]. The system must be divided as follows:

An employee who chooses to become a member of group A shall thereby elect to become subject to the laws relating to group A. Each such employee shall enter the employee’s mailing address on such form. At the time the state agency certifies to the governor that the plan of coverage required by section 52-10-05 meets the requirements of the law, the state agency shall certify to the governor the names and addresses of the employees of the political subdivision who have indicated their desire to become members of group A.

If a majority of the members of group A vote in favor of such coverage, the amendments made and provisions created by this section shall be fully operative. If less than a majority vote in favor of such coverage, such amendments and provisions do not continue in effect and a retirement system must be deemed not to be divided into group A and group B.

       The North Dakota national guard is authorized to establish an employee retirement program by contract with an insurance company, state or national bank and trust company, or an investment company, authorized under the law to do business in this state, the state investment board, or the North Dakota public employees retirement system. Except for a retirement program established under chapter 54-52, the North Dakota national guard shall prepare specifications of the terms of the retirement program which must be submitted to not less than three companies or agencies with a request for bids upon the retirement program contracts. After the submission of at least three bids, the adjutant general shall compare the bids, and with the approval of the governor, shall execute a contract for the retirement program with the company or agency submitting the lowest and best bid. The public employees retirement system board is authorized to administer the retirement plan established in 1961 and frozen to new entrants in 1980 for employees of job service North Dakota. The public employees retirement system board shall fund the administrative expenses of administering that retirement plan from the funds in that plan.

       The employing agency shall be authorized to withhold the employee’s share of the contributions required under such retirement program from the salary paid each employee of such agency. The amount of such withholding must be an adjustable percentage rate of the employee’s salary sufficient to provide financing of the required employee’s contributions to such retirement plan as such plan was originally contracted and as it has been or will be amended, provided that such percentage rate may not exceed the percentage rate which may be fixed for withholding from federal employees for employee contributions to the federal retirement program under civil service. The employing agency shall be authorized to pay a sum as prescribed in the program contract toward the cost of such retirement program, which sum may not be in excess of the amount approved by the appropriate federal agency supervising the payment or reimbursement of salary and retirement program costs. The amount withheld from the wages due an employee and the amount to be paid by the employing agency must be paid to the company holding such retirement program contract in accordance with the terms of such contract.
      </li>
      <li id="t52c52-11s52-11-01ol13">
       The employing agency’s share of the costs of such retirement program must be paid from any funds made available to it for this purpose by the United States government, and in the case of employees of such agencies for whom the state does not receive federal payments for salary costs, such employer’s share may be made from any appropriations made available for the purpose of paying such salaries. Payments may be made for prior service of employees in accordance with the terms of the retirement program contract and in accordance with the availability of funds. The contract must specify the terms and conditions under which employee contributions may be withdrawn from the program and for the crediting of the employer’s contributions to future payments due from the employing agency. Provision may be made in the contract for optional payment of benefits to survivors of covered employees. Each agency participating in the retirement program shall be authorized to do all things necessary for the proper administration of the program, but no benefits payable under the terms of the retirement program contract shall ever become an obligation of the state.
