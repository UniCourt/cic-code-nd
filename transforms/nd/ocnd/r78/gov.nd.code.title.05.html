   <p>
    Section 33 of chapter 80 of the 1967 Session Laws repealed title 5 of the North Dakota Century Code. This section specifies that the provisions of chapter 80 shall replace the provisions of title 5 of the North Dakota Century Code. Therefore the provisions of chapter 80 of the 1967 Session Laws have been placed in title 5 of the North Dakota Century Code and supersede any of the provisions of title 5 which were in effect prior to July 1, 1967.

       In a prosecution for bootlegging, the jury was justified in finding that the liquid sold was “alcohol” even though the liquid was a compound mixture of alcohol containing substances other than alcohol, including acetone.

       In amending the section of the prohibition law defining intoxicating liquors, it was proper to make any definition that would have been appropriate under the original measure undergoing amendment, and it was not necessary to state in the title of the amendatory act the exact character of the amendment. State v. Fargo Bottling Works Co., 19 N.D. 396, 124 N.W. 387, 26 L.R.A. (n.s.) 872 (N.D. 1910), explained, State ex rel. Gammons v. Shafer, 63 N.D. 128, 246 N.W. 874 (1933)

       In a prosecution under the prohibition law, it was proper for the court to instruct the jury that beer was a malt liquor, and intoxicating, and that if the defendant claimed the beer sold or kept on sale by him was not intoxicating the burden was upon him to show that fact.

       In a prosecution for unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor it was not necessary for the state to prove that the liquid involved was in fact intoxicating if it belonged to the enumeration in the statute before the words “in addition thereto”. State v. Schuck, 51 N.D. 875, 201 N.W. 342, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1924); State v. Gates, 52 N.D. 659, 204 N.W. 350, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       Where the court, in explaining why exhibits could not be sent to the jury room, referred to their contents as “intoxicating liquor”, it was not prejudicial error since the state had introduced testimony to the effect that the exhibits contained alcohol fit for use as a beverage, which was not controverted by defendant, and the jury had been previously instructed as to the burden of proof resting on the state. State v. McCauley, 68 N.D. 198, 277 N.W. 605, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1938).

       A defendant was improperly convicted of the crime of purchasing intoxicating liquor for persons under the age of twenty-one years in violation of former section 5-01-26 where the evidence, although showing that defendant had bought beer for minors, did not show that the beer contained more than four percent alcohol by weight within the former statutory definition of “intoxicating liquor”.

      A person may manufacture alcoholic beverages for personal or family use, and not for sale, without securing a license if the amount manufactured is within quantities allowed by the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the United States treasury department. Any person manufacturing alcoholic beverages within this state in quantities greater than those permitted by the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the United States treasury department is guilty of a class A misdemeanor and property used for the same is subject to disposition by the court except any person may establish a brewery for the manufacture of malt beverages, a winery, or a distillery or other plant for the distilling, manufacturing, or processing of alcohol within this state if the person has secured a license from the tax commissioner. This license must be issued on a calendar-year basis with a fee of five hundred dollars. A first-time license fee may be reduced twenty-five percent for each full quarter of a year elapsed between the first day of the year for which the license is issued and the date on which the application for the license is filed with the tax commissioner. A license may not be issued for any period for a fee less than one-half of the annual license fee. This license shall allow sale to only licensed wholesalers.

        Although arrest for DUI is some evidence of intoxication, city may not assume everyone arrested for DUI is intoxicated; before jail detention under this section, the officer must independently observe whether the person appears intoxicated and dangerous.

        Defendant’s seizure for detoxification at the detention center was not unlawful and was not an unreasonable seizure where an officer testified about his actual observations of defendant’s behavior, including that he thought defendant was intoxicated and was a danger to himself based on his statements and actions. Thus, under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t05c5-01s5-01-05" target="_self">5-01-05</a></cite>.1, the officer had discretion to decide whether defendant should have been detained for detoxification in the county detention center.

        The dram shop amendments in 1987 plainly granted persons injured by an obviously intoxicated person a dram shop claim for relief under the comparative fault guidelines against persons who knowingly sell alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person while that person is obviously intoxicated; the amendments specifically incorporated the requirement of N.D.C.C. § 32-03.2-02, for allocation of fault among all persons “who contributed to the injury.” Stewart v.

        It would be an absurd result if alcoholic beverage dealers could avoid liability for illegal sales to intoxicated customers depending upon whether the customers paid for their own drinks or took turns paying for each other’s drinks.

       </p>
       <p>
        Comparative negligence does not apply to actions brought under the Dram Shop Act; trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant-bar to include contributory negligence and assumption of risk in its answer as defenses, since these defenses have been replaced by comparative negligence, which is not a defense to a dramshop action.

        Where a markedly intoxicated person was sold or delivered an alcoholic beverage while in a tavern owned by defendant, and such intoxicated person thereafter negligently caused a collision which injured the plaintiff, and said collision occurred while the negligent party was still intoxicated, the injured party was entitled to recover money damages for personal injuries and property damage from the defendant tavern owner.

       <p>
        In an action brought by plaintiff for loss of services, support, and society of her husband who died as the result of injuries received in a bar operated by defendants, trial court did not err in denying defendants’ motion for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to arrive at a verdict where there was ample evidence on which the jury could have found for the plaintiff under allegations of her complaint charging that defendants sold alcoholic beverages to decedent after he became intoxicated and that such illegal sale contributed to the intoxication.

        Term “intoxicated” as used in former § 5-01-06 differed from that of “under the influence of intoxicating liquor”; to interpret the terms as synonymous would distort the function of the Dram Shop Act by rendering the seller of liquor liable even if he was unable to discern that the buyer was, in any way, intoxicated; it was not error in dram shop action to give instruction calling attention to the distinction between the two terms and defining “intoxicated” as referring to one whose ordinary judgment and common senses have been disturbed and whose symptoms were reasonably discernible to a person of ordinary experience.

        The county court misinterpreted the statutes when it held that it was not a delinquent act for a minor to enter a liquor establishment, or purchase, attempt to purchase, consume, or possess alcoholic beverages; the fact that the legislature has chosen to define as unruly a child who has committed these delinquent acts is not determinative of whether the acts themselves are classified as delinquent and contributing to such behavior can constitute contributing to delinquency.

        Although N.D.C.C. § 5-01-08 prohibits persons under 21 years of age from purchasing alcohol, attempting to purchase alcohol, and entering premises where alcoholic beverages are sold, law enforcement officials do not violate the law when conducting compliance checks because N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-02(4) gives law enforcement officials the authority to use persons under 21 years of age for this purpose.

        Where a juvenile went to a house, knowing that alcohol was present, and remained there for some 30 minutes, those circumstances of knowledge and proximity alone were not enough to establish actual possession. Her mere presence in a house where alcohol was accessible, without any actual control of the alcohol, was insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a determination that the minor was in possession of alcohol. In Interest of K.S., 500 N.W.2d 603, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        Under this section, “possession” requires that a minor exercise some degree of actual dominion or control over an alcoholic beverage. In Interest of K.S., 500 N.W.2d 603, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        Defendant’s passenger’s breath sample indicated a blood alcohol content of .083 percent, which provided probable cause that she committed the crime of minor in possession of alcohol, and defendant’s admission that there was alcohol in the car, coupled with the evidence that the passenger had consumed alcohol, would be enough to provide a reasonable belief that the passenger had actual control over those beverages in the vehicle, thus violating the law prohibiting minors from being in possession of alcohol; thus, the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle for alcohol, as it constituted an identifiable object connected with the passenger’s criminal activity.

        District court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant’s motion to refund fines and administrative fees incurred in relation to his criminal conviction for delivery of alcoholic beverages to a person under 21 years of age because, although defendant appealed his drug related convictions, he failed to appeal from the alcohol conviction because the case number for that conviction had not been included in his notice of appeal and defendant allowed the case to proceed through appeal, oral argument, and a written opinion by the Supreme Court of North Dakota without ever attempting to correct the notice of appeal.

        Evidence was sufficient to establish that beverage contained in a keg and delivered to a person under twenty-one years of age contained at least one-half of one percent of alcohol by volume, and was thus an alcoholic beverage, where the keg registration card signed by defendant indicated that the keg contained “Pabst” beer and where sheriff, who confiscated the keg, and other minors at the party gave opinion testimony that the keg contained beer.

       A microbrew pub shall obtain a brewer license and a retailer license as required under this title. A microbrew pub may manufacture on the licensed premises, store, transport, sell to wholesale malt beverage licensees, and export no more than ten thousand barrels of malt beverages annually; sell malt beverages manufactured on the licensed premises; sell alcoholic beverages regardless of source to consumers for consumption on the microbrew pub’s licensed premises; and sell or direct ship malt beverages manufactured on the licensed premises to an individual in this state for consumption in accordance with section 5-01-16. A microbrew pub may not engage in any wholesaling activities. Except as provided in subsection 3, all sales and delivery of malt beverages to any other retail licensed premises may be made only through a wholesale malt beverage licensee. Beer manufactured on the licensed premises and sold by a microbrew pub directly to the consumer for consumption on or off the premises is subject to the taxes imposed pursuant to section 5-03-07, in addition to any other taxes imposed on brewers and retailers. A microbrew pub is required to file a monthly sales report with the tax commissioner by the fifteenth day of the month following the month in which the sales are made. The report must be prepared and submitted in a form and manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner. A microbrew pub is not precluded from retailing beer it purchases from a wholesaler. Complimentary samples of beer may not be in an amount exceeding sixteen ounces [.47 liter] per patron. A licensee may sell beer to any person for off-premises consumption if sold in a brewery-sealed container and the total amount sold to each person does not exceed five and sixteen-hundredths gallons [19.53 liters] per day. This section may not be superseded under chapters 11-09.1 and 40-05.1.

      Before a state retail off sale alcoholic beverage license may be issued to a person whose business to be licensed is located in a building that is primarily a gas station, grocery store, or convenience store, the area to be licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages must be clearly set out in a blueprint or diagram. The area licensed for the sale of alcoholic beverages must be separated from the nonlicensed portion of the business by a wall designed to allow sales personnel to serve customers and make sales in both the licensed and unlicensed portions of the premises, and that may allow customers in either portion of the premises access to the other portion.

N.D.C.C. § 40-05-01(29) granted municipalities the power to regulate the use and licensure of alcoholic beverages while N.D.C.C. § 40-05-06 limited their ability to impose a penalty greater than a class B misdemeanor; the penalty of a municipal ordinance could differ from the penalty imposed by the state law in those situations in which the municipality authorized imposition of up to the maximum allowable municipal penalty that was lesser than the state law penalty for an equivalent statute.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person having information that a licensed retailer of alcoholic beverages has violated any provisions of this title may file with the attorney general, city attorney, or state’s attorney an affidavit specifically setting forth such violation. Upon receipt of such affidavit, the city attorney or state’s attorney shall set the matter for hearing not later than the next regular meeting of the local governing body or forward such affidavit to the attorney general. Upon receipt of any such affidavit, the attorney general shall set the matter for hearing in the local county courthouse not less than ten days after copies of the affidavit and notice of hearing have been mailed to the licensee by registered mail. If the hearing is held by the local governing body, a copy of this affidavit and notice of hearing must be mailed to the licensee by registered mail not less than five days before such hearing. A record of such hearings will be made by stenographic notes or the use of an electronic recording device.

       Appeal from an order revoking retail liquor and beer licenses is governed by the procedures of the Administrative Agencies Practice Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 28-32. In re Retail Liquor License No. 15, 283 N.W.2d 170, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 286</cite> (N.D. 1979).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The right of appeal from an order of the attorney general suspending or revoking a license, the method of taking an appeal, the scope of the trial in the district court, the appeal to the supreme court and the scope of review in the supreme court all stemmed from the statute, which authorized the appeals to be taken and authorized the court to hear and determine them. In re Guon, 76 N.D. 589, 38 N.W.2d 280, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1949); State v. Jorda, 74 N.W.2d 95, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        An appeal to the district court from an order of the attorney general revoking a liquor license had to be heard in the district court according to the procedure provided in chapter 28-32, without a jury, and solely on the record made on the attorney general’s hearing.

      If a full bottle of wine has been opened and the contents partially consumed, a retail alcoholic beverage licensee whose gross sales of food are at least thirty percent of the gross sales of alcoholic beverages consumed on the premises may permit an individual purchasing the bottle to remove the bottle when leaving the licensed premises if the licensee reseals the bottle with a seal that must be made conspicuously inoperative to reopen the bottle, and places a receipt of sale with the bottle. The removal of the bottle under these conditions is not an off sale of wine and is permitted without an additional license.

      Before any person engages in the sale at wholesale of beer or liquor in this state, that person shall first procure a license from only the state tax commissioner. The license must only allow sale to licensed retailers, licensed wholesalers, regular retail outlets on federal military reservations, and sale for export from a federally bonded warehouse, or a foreign trade zone, to an export bonded warehouse.

     <p>
      The fee for an annual wholesale liquor license is one thousand dollars. The fee for an annual wholesale beer license is two hundred dollars. Fees must be reduced twenty-five percent for each full quarter of a year elapsed between the first day of the year for which the license is issued and the date on which the application for the license is filed with the state tax commissioner. When an application clearly indicates that the applicant does not desire to exercise the privileges granted by the license applied for until on or after the beginning of the quarterly period following the quarterly period in which the application is filed with the department, the fees must be reduced twenty-five percent for each full quarter of a year elapsing between the first day of the year for which the license is issued and the date indicated on the application. A license may not be issued for any period for a fee less than one-half of the annual license fee.

    Examination by tax commissioner — Penalty for improper returns.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The state tax commissioner may at any reasonable time make an examination of the books and premises of any retailer, wholesaler, manufacturer, domestic winery, domestic distillery, microbrew pub, direct shipper, licensed alcohol carrier, licensed logistics shipper, or other person to determine if the person has fully complied with all statutes and rules pertaining to the person’s business. If any manufacturer, wholesaler, domestic winery, domestic distillery, microbrew pub, or direct shipper liable for any taxes imposed by this chapter fails to pay such tax on the date payment is due, there must be added to the tax a penalty of five percent of the total amount of the tax or five dollars, whichever is greater, plus interest of one percent of the tax per month or fraction of a month of delay, except the first month after the return or tax became due. Any manufacturer, wholesaler, domestic winery, domestic distillery, microbrew pub, direct shipper, licensed alcohol carrier, or licensed logistics shipper failing to furnish reports when required must be assessed a penalty of one hundred dollars for each day such reports are delinquent. The state tax commissioner may forgive all or part of any penalty for good cause shown. The tax commissioner shall give notice of the determination to the person liable for tax. If the determination of tax due relates to an incorrect or insufficient return filed by a taxpayer, notice of the determination must be given not later than three years after the last day on which the return was due or three years after the return was filed, whichever is later. If it is determined upon audit by the tax commissioner that the tax due was twenty-five percent or more above the amount reported on the return, notice of determination of tax due must be given not later than six years after the last day on which the return was due or six years after the return was filed, whichever is later. Notice of determination of tax due for any reporting period for which a taxpayer failed to file a return must be given not later than six years after the due date of the return, but if fraudulent information is given in a return or the failure to file a return is due to the fraudulent intent or willful attempt of the taxpayer in any manner to evade the tax, the time limitation provided in this section for giving notice of the determination of tax due does not apply. If any manufacturer, wholesaler, domestic winery, domestic distillery, microbrew pub, or direct shipper files a fraudulent return, there must be added to the tax an amount equal to the tax evaded or attempted to be evaded and such manufacturer, wholesaler, domestic winery, domestic distillery, microbrew pub, or direct shipper is also guilty of a class C felony. All such taxes and civil penalties may be collected by assessment or distraint, and no court of this state may enjoin the collection of any such tax or civil penalty. No wholesaler may purchase alcoholic beverages from a manufacturer after notice from the tax commissioner that such manufacturer has failed to file required reports with the tax commissioner’s office. Any manufacturer, wholesaler, domestic winery, domestic distillery, microbrew pub, direct shipper, licensed alcohol carrier, or licensed logistics shipper may have its license suspended or revoked for violation of any of the provisions of this title after a hearing conducted similar to that prescribed by this law.

    Same brands — Assignment of brand extensions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Different categories of products manufactured and marketed under a common identifying trade name are the same brand. For example, “old faithful” includes “old faithful”, “old faithful light”, “old faithful draft”, “old faithful dry”, and other products identified principally by the old faithful name. Differences in packaging do not establish different brands. A brewer or importer may assign a brand extension only to the wholesaler with an exclusive sales territory to the brand that is the basis for the brand extension. This limitation does not apply to assignments of brand extensions to wholesalers which were made by a brewer or importer before August 1, 1995. If, before August 1, 1995, a brewer or importer assigned a brand extension to a wholesaler that is without exclusive sales territory to the brand that is the basis of the brand extension, any additional brand extension must be assigned to the wholesaler who first had the brand.
