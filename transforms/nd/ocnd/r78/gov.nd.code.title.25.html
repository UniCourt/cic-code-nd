    Investigation of institutions — Witnesses — Fees — Not excused from testifying.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The supervising department, in aid of the investigation of any institution under its control, may summon and compel the attendance of witnesses and examine the same under oath, which any member thereof shall have the power to administer. The supervising department shall have access to all books, accounts, papers, and property material to such investigation and may order the production of any other books or papers material thereto. Witnesses other than those in the employ of the state are entitled to the same fees as are allowed in civil cases in the district court. The claim that any testimony or evidence sought to be elicited or produced on such examination may tend to incriminate the person giving or producing it, or expose that person to public ignominy, does not excuse that person from testifying or producing evidence, documentary or otherwise, but no person may be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture for and on account of any matter or thing concerning which the person may testify or produce such evidence. The witness is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.

        Where the evidence showed that a nine-year old boy’s adjustment to social situations, self-care and self-control were substantially below that of his peers, and his I.Q. was so high as to override any conclusion that his inability to measure up to his peers was due to mental retardation, he was adjudged developmentally disabled as the phrase is used in this section.

        This section, which defines developmental disability is identical to the federal statute except that the format is improved and in place of the phrase “economic self-sufficiency” this section uses the phrase “economic sufficiency”; therefore, the two statutes have identical meanings.

        Chapters of DHR’s Manual, which prescribed the method to determine who may be appropriately served by the Developmental Disabilities Division and served to identify the members of the plaintiff class in ARC v. Olson and others who may be appropriately served, did not deal only with internal management of the department so as to be exempt from the rulemaking requirements of <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32" target="_blank">Chapter 28-32</a></cite> pursuant to the definition of “rule” in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-01" target="_blank">28-32-01</a></cite>. And because these chapters were not adopted in accordance with <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32" target="_blank">Chapter 28-32</a></cite>, they were invalid, and the department’s denials of applications for case management services were ineffective.

        Chapters of DHR’s Manual, which prescribed the method to determine who may be appropriately served by the Developmental Disabilities Division and served to identify the members of the plaintiff class in ARC v. Olson and others who may be appropriately served, did not deal only with internal management of the department so as to be exempt from the rulemaking requirements of N.D.C.C. ch. 28-32 pursuant to the definition of “rule” in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-32s28-32-01" target="_blank">28-32-01</a></cite>. And because these chapters were not adopted in accordance with N.D.C.C. ch. 28-32, they were invalid, and the department’s denials of applications for case management services as a result of the application of those regulations were ineffective.

       “Mentally ill person” or “person who is mentally ill” means an individual with an organic, mental, or emotional disorder that substantially impairs the capacity to use self-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of personal affairs and social relations. The term does not include an individual with an intellectual disability of significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning that originates during the developmental period and is associated with impairment in adaptive behavior, although an individual who is intellectually disabled may also be a person who is mentally ill. A substance use disorder does not per se constitute mental illness, although an individual with a substance use disorder may also be a person who is mentally ill.

        A finding that the person is mentally ill is not alone sufficient to justify court-ordered treatment; the law authorizes an involuntary commitment only if the petitioner proves by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a person requiring treatment as defined in this section.

        Where there is no evidence to prove underlying allegations, and those allegations are generalized descriptions of inappropriate behavior that connote little risk of physical harm to the patient, the record does not meet the statutory standard requiring clear and convincing evidence of a substantial likelihood of substantial deterioration in physical health, and the involuntary treatment order must be reversed.

        In a case in which a patient appealed the trial court’s orders for hospitalization and treatment, insufficient findings appeared in the record to support the trial court’s orders. The trial court erred in failing to make finding specially whether hospitalization was the least restrictive alternative form of treatment for the patient.

        Where, at best, the record led only to the conclusion that a patient was a person who would benefit from treatment with medication and that such treatment would only be possible if he were hospitalized, because otherwise he refused to take medication, the statutory standard which authorized courts to commit the mentally ill had not been met. The standard for involuntary commitment remains clear and convincing proof that the mentally ill individual is a person who requires treatment as defined by the statute. In Interest of M.B., 467 N.W.2d 902, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>

        Orders for involuntary hospitalization and treatment were reversed because the State had not shown by clear and convincing evidence substantial determinations based upon recent poor self-control or judgment in providing one’s shelter, nutrition, or personal care,
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12) [now (13)], nor did a generalized natural tendency for schizophrenics to worsen establish a substantial likelihood for a particular individual.

        Where evidence of a nine-year old boy’s mental illness included extreme hyperactivity and bizarre behavior associated with Tourette’s Syndrome, the court held him to be mentally ill as the phrase is used in this section. Association for Retarded Citizens v. Sinner, 115 F.R.D. 28, 1987 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1462 (D.N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        Where patient took such impulsive aggressive actions including ramming a car and exhibited behavior evidencing dangerousness to himself, others, and property, and treating physician testified that patient’s condition would deteriorate substantially if he did not take his medication, such findings supported the involuntary commitment hearing that patient with history of chronic paranoid schizophrenia was mentally ill and in need of treatment. In Interest of T.A., 472 N.W.2d 226, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>
        Respondent was held to be a “mentally ill person”, where expert testified that if he did not take his medication he had episodes of seizures and unwarranted behavior, which he might not be able to remember, and that he had not taken his medication prior to admission to hospital, which resulted in assaultive behavior and physical aggression. Avard v. K.J.L. (In Interest of K.J.L.), 541 N.W.2d 698, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in ordering a patient’s hospitalization and treatment at the State Hospital for 90 days because the patient had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the record supported the trial court’s findings and conclusion that the patient’s mental illness put him at risk of hurting himself or others and that alternative treatment would not be sufficient to meet the patient’s needs because of safety concerns. Beane v. S.R.B. (In re S.R.B.), 2013 ND 109, 832 N.W.2d 42, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Determination that a person is in need of treatment is a finding of fact rather than a conclusion of law; as such, it is subject to the clearly erroneous rule on appeal. Dayap v. Kupperion, 331 N.W.2d 22 (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s finding that individual was a “person requiring treatment” was not supported by clear and convincing evidence, and was therefore clearly erroneous, where no expert witnesses were called to give an opinion as to whether or not the individual was mentally ill and posed a serious risk of harm to himself, to others or to property as to constitute a “person requiring treatment”, and none of the medical reports admitted into evidence contained such a determination. In Interest of Rambousek, 331 N.W.2d 548, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1983).

       <p>
        Trial court’s finding that twenty-five year old woman diagnosed as having a schizo-affective disorder, with a long-standing delusional system, was severely mentally ill and therefore a “person requiring treatment” would be upheld. In Interest of Abbott, 369 N.W.2d 116, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 333</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>

        State law authorizes an involuntary commitment only if the petitioner proves by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a person requiring treatment as defined under subdivision 10 (now subdivision 13) of this section.
   Radmore v. R.N., 450 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at best the record led only to the conclusion that respondent was a person who would benefit from treatment with medication and that such treatment was only possible if she were hospitalized, because she otherwise refused to take medication, the evidence was insufficient to support her involuntary commitment; the standard for involuntary commitment remains clear and convincing proof that the mentally ill individual is a person who requires treatment as defined by the statute, not one who would benefit from treatment. Radmore v. R.N., 450 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination that an individual is a person requiring treatment under the statutory definition is a two-step process. Initially, the court must find that the individual is “mentally ill” and, secondly, the court must conclude that there is a reasonable expectation that if the person is not treated there exists a serious risk of harm to that person, others, or property. In Interest of L.B., 452 N.W.2d 75, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court could have found that there was clear and convincing evidence that appellant was a mentally ill person within the meaning of subdivision 9 (now 12) of this section, who requires treatment pursuant to subdivision 10 (now 11).
   In Interest of L.B., 452 N.W.2d 75, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory definition of a person requiring treatment is not the same as a medical opinion or diagnosis that such person is in need of treatment. It may well be “conclusive” from a medical standpoint that a given individual requires treatment for that person’s optimum health, but still not satisfy the statute. In this sense, a court should not accept as conclusive an opinion of a medical expert that a person requires treatment, unless that opinion is supported by facts. In Interest of M.H., 475 N.W.2d 552, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Where defendant had injured a staff person at the State Hospital and was delusional and verbally and physically aggressive and the court held that an alternative treatment program, less restrictive than hospitalization, would not meet her needs, finding that she would injure others and act on her delusions, defendant was properly found to be a person requiring treatment. In Interest of S.S., 491 N.W.2d 721, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Where the record contained no clear and convincing evidence that a person was a threat to himself, to others, or to property, the statutory standard for involuntary commitment had not been met.

        A person must continue to be mentally ill to require continued treatment. Kottke v. R.N., 513 N.W.2d 370, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        Evidence supported trial court’s conclusion respondent required treatment and that out patient treatment was appropriate; by ordering out patient treatment, trial court did not imply treatment was not required, since out patient treatment was ordered so respondent would receive medication necessary to prevent seizures and stabilize his mood, so that he would not pose a risk of harm. Avard v. K.J.L. (In Interest of K.J.L.), 541 N.W.2d 698, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Where patient demonstrated continued aggressiveness and poor judgment, made statements that he would not take his medication if he was not in the hospital, and where he hit a doctor and another patient when his medication was previously reduced, the doctor could conclude that patient would be dangerous to himself and others without his current treatment. Waters v. J.S. (In re J.S.), 545 N.W.2d 145, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Evidence that the patient had schizophrenia of the paranoid type, delusional in nature, had made suicide threats to his mother, and had told doctor he was the father of over 70 cows and was inventing a new religion he could use against his doctor, was sufficient to support a finding the patient was a person requiring treatment. M.K. v. J.K. (In the Interest of J.K.), 1999 ND 182, 599 N.W.2d 337, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Although patient with bipolar I disorder was mentally ill under the first prong of the test for determining whether someone is “a person requiring treatment” for purposes of
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12) [now (13)], the second prong of the test was not met because the patient’s lack of prudence and business acumen as revealed by her act of writing a large check in anticipation of a check coming in, was not the predictable dangerousness to property envisioned by
   § 25-03.1-02(12) sufficient to subject the patient to a mental health treatment order.

        Commitment order was not clearly erroneous under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12) [now (13)] where the patient was mentally ill and, given witness testimony and other evidence, there was a reasonable expectation that if the patient was not hospitalized there existed a serious risk of harm to himself, others, or property.

        Although the citizen argued that he was not mentally ill, that he was not a person requiring treatment, and that involuntary hospitalization and treatment with medication was not the least restrictive alternative treatment, the appellate court noted that if the citizen was not hospitalized and treated, his kidney condition would have eventually led to renal failure or other life-threatening conditions; thus, the evidence sufficiently showed that he was a mentally ill person requiring treatment under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12).
   Pryatel v. M.M. (In the Interest of M.M.), 2005 ND 219, 707 N.W.2d 78, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Involuntary commitment order was upheld because a patient was a person requiring treatment under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12) [now (13)] where the evidence showed that he entered a police station armed with a gun, he had routine fears that people were out to get him, he imagined that microphones were in his home, he thought that his name was being announced over police scanners, and he was fearful of answering the telephone and leaving his home.

        Order granting a state hospital psychiatrist’s request to involuntarily treat appellant with prescription medication was overturned where there was no finding under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12) [now (13)] that appellant was mentally ill or chemically dependent and that there was a reasonable expectation that if appellant was not treated there existed a serious risk of harm to appellant, others, or property.

       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not clearly err when it found that the patient was a mentally ill person requiring inpatient treatment because the State hospital established that the patient had a mental illness by clear and convincing evidence and that he posed a serious risk of harm to either himself, others, or property; doctors stated in their reports that the patient had a mental illness, and the patient displayed extremely risky behavior. State v. B.A.C. (In the Interest of

       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in finding that a patient was a person requiring treatment because there was not clear and convincing evidence of a reasonable expectation that if the patient was not treated for mental illness, there would be a serious risk of harm to her, others, or property; a doctor testified that the patient required no restraint, medication, or seclusion while hospitalized, and the record only supports the conclusion that she would benefit from medication. Ressler v. B.A.K. (In the Interest of B.A.K.), 2018 ND 139, 911 N.W.2d 882, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 142</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of an involuntary commitment, the district court did not err in ordering that the patient continue her treatment at the state hospital because she presented a serious risk of harm to herself as she suffered from a disorder which substantially impaired her self-control, judgment and discretion in the conduct of personal affairs and social relations; and the psychologist testified that without the supervised medication the patient was likely to regress to a similar state in which she was initially found, putting herself at risk of injury or death; and because alternative treatment would not presently be adequate to meet the patient’s needs for treatment or to prevent harm to herself or others. Pryatel v. Doe (In re Doe), 2019 ND 23, 921 N.W.2d 403, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that respondent was a person requiring treatment was not clearly erroneous where it had already found that the evidence supported the finding that he was mentally ill, and the evidence showed that he was at high risk of discontinuing medication, his condition was likely to deteriorate without treatment, and thus, he was likely to pose a risk to himself or others. DeDona v. E.S. (In the Interest of E.S.), 2019 ND 12, 921 N.W.2d 408, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Trial court’s finding that individual with schizo affective and schizophrenia was in need of treatment under the provisions of subsection (10)(d) (now subsection (13)) of this section was not clearly erroneous. Individual would be at serious risk of substantial deterioration in her mental health without forced hospitalization.

       <p>
        The county court did not err in its determination that a patient was a person requiring treatment under the statutory definition in subsection 11 [now subsection (13)] of this section where the patient refused medication, had made threats and had used physical force against his father, and had maimed and killed some kittens.

        Where doctor testified that patient suffered from a chronic mental illness called bi-polar disorder, which if untreated caused hyperactivity, and also testified that she tended to quit taking her medicine because she lacked insight into her illness, this testimony clearly and convincingly showed that patient suffered from a mental illness impairing her judgment and self control. Kottke v. R.N., 513 N.W.2d 370, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s conclusion that if petitioner was not treated for her mental illness there was a substantial likelihood she would pose a danger to herself or others was supported by clear and convincing evidence, where doctor and social worker testified that she had made several past suicide attempts and threats, and that she refused treatment for her mental illness. Waters v. C.W. (In re C.W.), 552 N.W.2d 382, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        There was sufficient evidence to support the district court’s findings that the inmate was mentally ill and required treatment because a correctional officer testified that the inmate had engaged in bizarre activities such as washing his undergarments and hands in an unflushed toilet. A doctor testified that he had diagnosed the inmate with schizophrenia and that the inmate had been engaging in sexually aggressive and predatory behavior while at the state hospital.

       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported order committing respondent to a state hospital for 90 days under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12) [now (13)]; a psychiatrist testified that respondent was delusional, was getting inadequate sleep, and posed a danger to respondent’s self or others.

       </p>
       <p>
        Court properly found that a patient posed a “serious risk of harm” because a letter from the patient’s sister indicated a substantial likelihood of the patient inflicting serious bodily harm on another person, and a witness testified the patient’s manic behaviors made it unlikely he would be able to stay in a homeless shelter or find work. Without treatment the patient would be unable to provide himself with food, clothing, and shelter.

     <p>
      Under rules adopted by the department, screening of an individual to a public treatment facility for observation, diagnosis, care, or treatment for mental illness or a substance use disorder must be performed, in person when reasonably practicable, by a regional human service center. This screening must be performed in the region where the individual is physically located. Upon the request of a court, a law enforcement official, a mental health professional, the individual’s legal guardian, a minor’s parent or legal custodian, or the individual requesting services, the regional human service center shall conduct a screening. If a request for screening is made by a mental health professional and the individual who is the subject of the screening does not authorize the disclosure of the individual’s protected health information, upon the request of the regional human service center, any mental health professional who treated the individual within the previous six months shall disclose, subject to the requirements of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, part 2, to the human service center any relevant protected health information regarding that treatment. Upon receipt of the request, the regional human service center shall arrange for a screening of the individual and, if appropriate, shall treat the applicant or refer the applicant to the appropriate treatment facility. Upon admittance to a public treatment facility, the superintendent or director shall immediately designate a tier 1 or tier 2 mental health professional to examine the individual.

        Order by trial court requiring continuing treatment for a patient was not clearly erroneous, as uncontradicted evidence revealed that the patient became violent when not taking his medication and the patient denied his illness and refused to voluntarily take his medication. Pryatel v. J.S. (In the Interest of J.S.), 1998 ND 92, 578 N.W.2d 91, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the citizen argued that he was not mentally ill, that he was not a person requiring treatment, and that involuntary hospitalization and treatment with medication was not the least restrictive alternative treatment, the appellate court noted that if the citizen was not hospitalized and treated, his kidney condition would have eventually led to renal failure or other life-threatening conditions; thus, the evidence sufficiently showed that he was a mentally ill person requiring treatment under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12).
   Pryatel v. M.M. (In the Interest of M.M.), 2005 ND 219, 707 N.W.2d 78, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order committing respondent to a state hospital for 90 days was upheld where there was clear and convincing evidence to support an order for involuntary inpatient treatment; a psychiatrist testified that respondent was delusional, was getting inadequate sleep, and posed a danger to respondent’s self or others.
   Miller v. B.D.K (In re B.D.K.), 2007 ND 186, 742 N.W.2d 41, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2007).

        Where, at best, the record led only to the conclusion that the patient was a person who would benefit from treatment with medication and that such treatment would only be possible if he were hospitalized, because otherwise he refuses to take medication, the statutory standard which authorized courts to commit the mentally ill had not been met. The standard for involuntary commitment remains clear and convincing proof that the mentally ill individual is a person who requires treatment as defined by the statute. In Interest of M.B., 467 N.W.2d 902, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Orders for involuntary hospitalization and treatment were reversed because the State had not shown by clear and convincing evidence substantial determinations based upon recent poor self-control or judgment in providing one’s shelter, nutrition, or personal care,
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12) [now (13)], nor did a generalized natural tendency for schizophrenics to worsen establish a substantial likelihood for a particular individual.
   M.M.K. v. W.K. (In re W.K.), 2009 ND 218, 776 N.W.2d 572, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in finding that a patient was a person requiring treatment because there was not clear and convincing evidence of a reasonable expectation that if the patient was not treated for mental illness, there would be a serious risk of harm to her, others, or property; a doctor testified that the patient required no restraint, medication, or seclusion while hospitalized, and the record only supports the conclusion that she would benefit from medication.

     <p>
      If the petition is not accompanied by a written supportive statement of a tier 1 mental health professional or a licensed addiction counselor who has examined the respondent within the last forty-five days, the court shall order the respondent be examined by an expert examiner of the respondent’s own choice or one appointed by the court. The order must state the date and time within which the respondent must appear; the address to which the respondent is to report; a statement that if the respondent fails to appear at the appointed place at or before the ordered date and time, the respondent may be involuntarily taken into custody and transported to the appointed place; and a statement the expert examiner may consult with or request participation in the examination by a mental health professional and may include with the written examination report any findings or observations by that mental health professional. Accompanying the order must be an explanation of the intended uses and possible effects of this examination. The examination may be conducted at a treatment facility, at the respondent’s home, or at any other suitable place in the community. A request for examination at the state hospital must be screened and approved by a regional human service center. The respondent may be accompanied by one or more relatives or friends at the place of the examination. The costs of the court-ordered examination must be borne by the county that is the respondent’s place of residence.

       Respondent’s due process right to notice of the particular issues to be determined at the hearing was not affected by failure of examiner’s report to contain, as required by this section, a clear explanation of how the examiner arrived at the conclusion that the respondent was a person requiring treatment where the facts on which examiner based her conclusions were clearly stated in the record and were known by the respondent, and the determination that the respondent presented a serious risk of harm did not rest upon psychiatric interpretations of the subtle manifestations of mental disorder but rested on the respondent’s willful, overt acts which clearly demonstrated a serious risk of harm to the respondent and to the community.

       <p>
        Because the record did not show that appellant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, an order committing him to treatment in the state hospital for one year and allowing the State to involuntarily medicate him was reversed. The record did not demonstrate that appellant was made aware of the disadvantages of pro se representation at a March 16, 2006 hearing. Appellant’s comments that he thought he understood his right to an attorney, coupled with his subsequent comments, should have put the district court on notice that he was possibly not making his choice with eyes open; even if appellant validly waived his right to counsel at the March 16 hearing, the proceedings at the March 23 hearing should also have included another colloquy to determine appellant’s competence to waive counsel.

        Order involuntarily committing a patient and requiring forced medications was reversed on appeal because there was no colloquy conducted on the record as to whether or not the patient knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived the right to counsel under N.D.C.C. § 25.03.1-13(1); moreover, it was unclear whether the patient or his standby counsel was conducting the proceeding.

     <p>
      A patient who has requested release or an individual who is the subject of a petition for treatment has the right to refuse medication and other forms of treatment before the preliminary or treatment hearing. However, a physician, a physician assistant, or an advanced practice registered nurse may prescribe medication or a less restrictive alternative if it is necessary to prevent bodily harm to the respondent or others or to prevent imminent deterioration of the respondent’s physical or mental condition. The patient has the right to be free of the effects of medication at the preliminary or treatment hearing by discontinuance of medication no later than twenty-four hours before the hearing unless, in the opinion of the prescriber, the need for the medication still exists or discontinuation would hamper the respondent’s preparation for and participation in the proceedings.

        There was clear and convincing evidence to show that forced medication of the inmate with medication named in the request was necessary and appropriate because a second physician certified that the use of the medication was clinically appropriate and necessary; she further certified that there was a reasonable expectation that, if not treated with the medications, the inmate’s condition created a serious risk of harm to his person and that he was offered the appropriate medication but refused it.

        District court’s finding that the patient refused medication was not clearly erroneous, because the evidence established that the patient would refuse to take medication once the court-ordered medication period expired.

        Evidence presented at the patient’s involuntary commitment proceeding showed that the patient was also in need of the involuntary treatment and medication that the trial court ordered.

        Reviewing court rejected the patient’s argument that the district court’s forced medication order should be reversed since a State Hospital patient could not be subjected to more than one 90-day medication order, because the district court’s issuance of an additional 90-day forced medication order following a hearing on the matter did not violate N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t25c25-03.1s25-03.1-18" target="_self">25-03.1-18</a></cite>.1(3); legislative history clearly reflected the intention of the 1993 amendments to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t25c25-03.1s25-03.1-18" target="_self">25-03.1-18</a></cite>.1(3), was not to place a limitation on the number of 90-day forced medication orders that could be issued, but was to require a court hearing before an extension could be granted rather than allowing an extension based only on the report of a psychiatrist.

       <p>
        When the choice is between involuntarily treating a patient with drugs which could stabilize the patient and allow an early release from hospitalization, and not medicating the patient at all which could cause a deterioration in condition and lead to indefinite hospitalization, forced medication is the least restrictive form of treatment. Waters v. C.W. (In re C.W.), 552 N.W.2d 382, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the testimony of the patient’s treating physicians, it was clinically appropriate and necessary to treat the patient with the prescribed medication, i.e., injectable anti-psychotic medications, the prescribed medication was the least restrictive form of treatment necessary to meet his needs, and the benefits of the treatment outweighed known risks.
   Furthermore, the requested injectable medications would only be used if patient failed to take one of his anti-psychotic medications in pill form and, although patient was taking his pills at the time of the hearing, a recent history of failure to take the pills supported entry of the forced medication order. Therefore, the trial court considered all relevant evidence presented in authorizing involuntary treatment with prescribed medication under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t25c25-03.1s25-03.1-18" target="_self">25-03.1-18</a></cite>.1.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The scope of the Supreme Court’s review of an involuntary commitment order is limited to a review of procedures, findings, and conclusions of the lower court. In Interest of L.B., 452 N.W.2d 75, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) the trial court’s determination of whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a person in need of treatment is a finding of fact which will not be set aside on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. In Interest of L.B., 452 N.W.2d 75, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        A trial court’s determination of clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a person requiring treatment is a finding of fact subject to a “clearly erroneous” standard of review.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court’s finding that individual was a “person requiring treatment” was not supported by clear and convincing evidence, and was therefore clearly erroneous, where no expert witnesses were called to give an opinion as to whether or not the individual was mentally ill and posed a serious risk of harm to himself, to others, or to property as to constitute a “person requiring treatment”, and none of the medical reports admitted into evidence contained such a determination. In Interest of Rambousek, 331 N.W.2d 548, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a court can issue an order for an involuntary treatment, the petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a person requiring treatment. Kottke v. R.N., 513 N.W.2d 370, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        Where the record showed that (1) when the son was admitted to the treatment center he had a blood alcohol level of .430 and he tested positive for cannabis, and (2) the son admitted to a counselor that he had a binge drinking problem and that when he was drinking he did not take his medication for diabetes and Wernicke’s Syndrome, the order for involuntary treatment was affirmed because (1) the district court properly relied on the counselor’s assessment, in that the counselor’s testimony was based on the son’s medical records and his own statements, and the counselor did not rely solely on the allegations in the petition; thus, (2) the counselor’s testimony provided clear and convincing evidence to support the allegations in the petition. Martell v. L.D. (In re L.D.), 2003 ND 182, 671 N.W.2d 791, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 197</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court is required to make and prepare findings of fact which will justify legal conclusion of either commitment, alternative treatment, or no treatment; use of preprinted forms is not prohibited if forms are appropriately supplemented with specific facts on face of form or otherwise. In Interest of Riedel, 353 N.W.2d 773, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 377</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which a patient appealed the trial court’s orders for hospitalization and treatment, insufficient findings appeared in the record to support the trial court’s orders. The trial court erred in failing to make finding specially whether hospitalization was the least restrictive alternative form of treatment for the patient.
   Beane v. S.R.B.(In re S.R.B.), 2013 ND 75, 830 N.W.2d 565, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        State law authorizes an involuntary commitment only if the petitioner proves by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a person requiring treatment as defined under subdivision 12 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t25c25-03.1s25-03.1-02" target="_self">25-03.1-02</a></cite>. Radmore v. R.N., 450 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at best the record led only to the conclusion that respondent was a person who would benefit from treatment with medication and that such treatment was only possible if she were hospitalized, because she otherwise refused to take medication, the evidence was insufficient to support her involuntary commitment; the standard for involuntary commitment remains clear and convincing proof that the mentally ill individual is a person who requires treatment as defined by the statute, not one who would benefit from treatment. Radmore v. R.N., 450 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported trial court’s conclusion respondent required treatment and that out patient treatment was appropriate; by ordering out patient treatment, trial court did not imply treatment was not required, since out patient treatment was ordered so respondent would receive medication necessary to prevent seizures and stabilize his mood, so that he would not pose a risk of harm. Avard v. K.J.L. (In Interest of K.J.L.), 541 N.W.2d 698, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order by trial court requiring continuing treatment for a patient was not clearly erroneous, as uncontradicted evidence revealed that the patient became violent when not taking his medication and the patient denied his illness and refused to voluntarily take his medication. Pryatel v. J.S. (In the Interest of J.S.), 1998 ND 92, 578 N.W.2d 91, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1998).

       <p>
        While there exists a presumption in favor of the respondent that he or she does not require treatment, a court can order the involuntary treatment of a respondent if the petitioner proves by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a person requiring treatment.

       <p>
        The apparent purpose of the statutory requirement of the agreement of the attending physician to private hospitalization is to assume that the physician is willing and available to treat the individual. Insofar as there was no agreement by the attending physician to hospitalization in the private hospital, the court did not err in ordering hospitalization at the state hospital.

        Supreme court disapproved of trial court practice of entering findings and conclusions by placing a check mark beside applicable statements on a preprinted form and urged trial courts to enter full and specific findings showing the underlying basis upon which the court reached its determination that a person is or is not in need of treatment. In Interest of Rambousek, 331 N.W.2d 548, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s determination of whether or not there is clear and convincing evidence that a person is in need of treatment is a finding of fact which will not be set aside on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous. Dayap v. Kupperion, 331 N.W.2d 22 (N.D. 1983); In Interest of Rambousek, 331 N.W.2d 548, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1983).

       <p>
        A court’s findings and conclusions in an involuntary treatment case must be entered into the record, and can be stated orally if recorded in open court; a court’s findings are sufficient if they enable the supreme court to understand the reasoning behind the court’s decision. Kottke v. R.N., 513 N.W.2d 370, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>

        Trial court properly found that a patient, who had been involuntarily committed to a state hospital, was a mentally ill person in need of treatment and that alternative treatment to involuntary commitment at the state hospital was not appropriate.

       <p>
        Although the court found that the patient required treatment, it did not expressly find she was mentally ill or posed a serious risk to herself or others where the court was ruling on a petition to continue her treatment; it had already ordered both her outpatient treatment and hospitalization for failure to take her medicine, each time finding that the patient was mentally ill and if untreated would probably present a serious risk of danger to herself or others. This was the third time in three months the trial court found that she required treatment, and in light of these other recent orders by the same court, the factual reasons for continuing patient’s treatment were sufficiently expressed.

        Although the citizen argued that he was not mentally ill, that he was not a person requiring treatment, and that involuntary hospitalization and treatment with medication was not the least restrictive alternative treatment, the appellate court noted that if the citizen was not hospitalized and treated, his kidney condition would have eventually led to renal failure or other life-threatening conditions; thus, the evidence sufficiently showed that he was a mentally ill person requiring treatment under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12).

       Before the court makes a decision in an involuntary treatment hearing, the court shall review a report assessing the availability and appropriateness for the respondent of treatment programs other than hospitalization which has been prepared and submitted by the state hospital or treatment facility. If the court finds a treatment program other than hospitalization is adequate to meet the respondent’s treatment needs and is sufficient to prevent serious risk of harm, the court shall order the respondent to receive whatever treatment, other than hospitalization, is appropriate for a period of ninety days.

       If a peace officer, physician either in person or directing an emergency medical services professional, or any mental health professional reasonably believes the respondent is not complying with an order for alternative treatment, that the alternative treatment is not sufficient to prevent serious risk of harm , and that considerations of time and safety do not allow intervention by a court, the designated professional may cause the respondent to be taken into custody and detained at a treatment facility as provided in subsection 3 of section 25-03.1-25 and, within twenty-four hours, shall file a notice with the court stating the circumstances and factors of the case. The state hospital or public treatment facility immediately shall accept, if appropriately screened and medically stable, and a private treatment facility may accept, the respondent on a provisional basis. The superintendent or director shall require an immediate examination of the respondent and, within twenty-four hours after admission, shall release the respondent subject to the conditions of the original order or file a notice with the court stating in detail the circumstances and factors of the case.

         Alternative Treatment Not Appropriate.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Assuming that this section is applicable to a hearing for continuing treatment held pursuant to section 25-03.1-22(2), trial court did not err in refusing to order treatment outside a hospital where the evidence was clear and convincing that such limited treatment was not appropriate at that time and the evidence was also clear and convincing that a treatment program other than hospitalization would not, at that time, be adequate to meet the individual’s treatment needs nor sufficient to prevent harm or injury to him. Alagada v. Marty, 345 N.W.2d 46, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 263</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence as to the nature of appellant’s mental illness and its volatile and explosive characteristics, evoking behavior that was aggressive, uncontrollable and unpredictable, held to constitute clear and convincing evidence that any treatment outside of the hospital setting was not appropriate for appellant at the present time and would not be adequate to meet his treatment needs or to prevent harm to others. In Interest of Palmer, 363 N.W.2d 401, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        A reporting doctor may reasonably conclude that less restrictive alternatives to hospitalization simply do not exist. Waters v. J.S. (In re J.S.), 545 N.W.2d 145, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Less restrictive alternative treatment was inappropriate when the patient suffered from paranoid schizophrenia so severe that he was unable to accept or believe the information provided to him by the professional staff at the hospital, the patient did not appear to be any closer to recognizing that he had a serious mental illness, and he was not accepting of his diabetic condition. Pryatel v. J.S. (In the Interest of J.S.), 2003 ND 138, 667 N.W.2d 641, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a homeless patient’s early-stage dementia might have caused a harmful overdose of medication that he took for bipolar disorder, the district court did not err in finding, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-21(1), that a treatment program other than hospitalization was not suitable to the patient’s treatment needs.
   State Hosp. v. R.F. (In re R.F.), 2005 ND 54, 692 N.W.2d 905, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in ordering a patient’s hospitalization and treatment at the State Hospital for 90 days because the patient had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and the record supported the trial court’s findings and conclusion that the patient’s mental illness put him at risk of hurting himself or others and that alternative treatment would not be sufficient to meet the patient’s needs because of safety concerns. Beane v. S.R.B. (In re S.R.B.), 2013 ND 109, 832 N.W.2d 42, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        If another course than hospitalization is adequate for treatment and prevention of harm, the court is directed to use that alternative, rather than involuntary commitment. In Interest of T.A., 472 N.W.2d 226, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither the report assessing the appropriateness of alternate treatment for paranoid schizophrenic patient written on a pre-printed form with preprinted conclusions simply checked off nor the testimony of the psychiatric expert complied with the statutory requirement that availability and appropriateness of alternative treatment be considered before hospitalization is ordered. M.K. v. J.K. (In the Interest of J.K.), 1999 ND 182, 599 N.W.2d 337, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-21(1) requires the North Dakota State Hospital to prepare a report analyzing “treatment programs other than hospitalization.” However, the State Hospital does not have a statutory obligation to assess and review hospitals in other states before satisfying itself that hospitalization is the least restrictive treatment available; that was true where the patient desired an “alternative treatment program” in an out-of-state private facility, but where a State Hospital psychologist reported that the patient was not amenable to an alternative treatment program and that she needed a highly structured setting in a hospitalized environment.
   N.D. State Hosp. v. R.F. (In re R.F.), 2005 ND 102, 697 N.W.2d 311, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2005).

        In applying this section, the trial court must make a two-fold inquiry: (1) whether or not a treatment program other than hospitalization is adequate to meet the individual’s treatment needs, and (2) whether or not an alternative treatment program is sufficient to prevent harm or injuries which an individual may inflict upon himself or others. In Interest of J.A.D., 492 N.W.2d 82, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 208</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence did not establish that the patient was a person requiring treatment within the meaning of N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-02(12), so that the initial order for involuntary hospitalization and treatment was not valid, the predicate to an alternative treatment order was not present and that alternative treatment order had to be vacated. Haider v. H.G. (In the Interest of H.G.), 2001 ND 142, 632 N.W.2d 458, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 2001).

        In making its decision under this section, the trial court must determine by clear and convincing evidence that alternative treatment is not adequate and sufficient to prevent harm or injuries which an individual may inflict upon himself or others. In Interest of Palmer, 363 N.W.2d 401, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        The trial court must determine by clear and convincing evidence that alternative treatment is not adequate and that hospitalization is the least restrictive alternative; this determination will not be set aside on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous under N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a). In Interest of J.S., 499 N.W.2d 604, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 1993).

       <p>
        Court erred by finding that there was no less restrictive means to treat mentally ill patient when commitment to state hospital where the court’s findings were not supported by clear and convincing evidence. D.P. v. D.P., 2001 ND 203, 636 N.W.2d 921, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 2001).

        Violent, aggressive, and unpredictable behavior constitutes clear and convincing evidence that treatment outside a hospital would not be appropriate. In Interest of J.S., 499 N.W.2d 604, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (2) of this section did not require a finding of actual harm before a patient’s alternative treatment order could be terminated; hence, where the patient lit a match in her coat pocket while being transported in a police car, burning a hole in the carseat, her behavior constituted clear and convincing evidence that she was a danger to herself or others and her alternative treatment order was properly terminated. Trinidad v. K.P. (In re K.P.), 2003 ND 114, 665 N.W.2d 65, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court properly found that an alternative treatment order had failed to prevent the patient from harming herself or others when evidence showed that the patient had missed doses of her medication and brandished a scalpel at a police officer.

        Trial court’s determination of whether or not there is clear and convincing evidence that a treatment program other than hospitalization is not adequate and that this alternative treatment is not sufficient to prevent harm or injuries which an individual may inflict upon himself or others is a finding of fact which will not be set aside on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.

       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court urges trial courts to enter full, specific, and individualized written findings showing the underlying basis for its ultimate finding that inpatient treatment, rather than outpatient treatment, or vice versa, is required. In Interest of Daugherty, 332 N.W.2d 217, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 276</cite> (N.D. 1983).

        It is imperative for trial courts to set forth findings of fact that clearly support and explain both the determinations that (1) there is or is not in fact alternative treatment sufficient to meet a respondent’s needs, and (2) there is or is not in fact alternative treatment sufficient to prevent harm.

        Individual found by a trial court to be a “person requiring treatment” has a right to be submitted to the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of treatment. In Interest of Daugherty, 332 N.W.2d 217, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 276</cite> (N.D. 1983).

        Where neither a licensed psychiatrist nor a clinical psychologist testified in continued commitment proceedings, but only a physician, and only a physician’s report was filed with the petition, neither specifically identifying or incorporating the details of a report by a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist evaluating appellants mental illness, and while the evidence was far from clear and convincing that commitment to the state hospital was necessary, in view of the physician’s testimony that a nursing home would be suitable, if financial assistance were available, the order of indefinite commitment would be reversed, and the case would be remanded for a new hearing consistent with statutory requirements, at which the availability and appropriateness of alternative treatment in a less restrictive institution, such as a nursing home, would be fairly considered.

       <p>
        Although the patient argued that as part of the least restrictive conditions for his involuntary treatment under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-40(2), he should have been allowed to work outside of a state hospital, the supreme court found that he remained a risk if left unsupervised and allowing him to work ran counter to the continuing treatment order.

        In a case in which a patient appealed the trial court’s orders for hospitalization and treatment, insufficient findings appeared in the record to support the trial court’s orders. The trial court erred in failing to make finding specially whether hospitalization was the least restrictive alternative form of treatment for the patient.

        Trial court did not err when it found that hospitalization was the least restrictive alternative for respondent pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-21(1) where respondent, who suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, tardive dyskinesia, Type II diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis, testified that he did not believe that he had any illnesses and would not take any medications if he was released.

       </p>
       <p>
        Order committing respondent to a state hospital for 90 days was upheld where hospitalization was the least restrictive treatment option available under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-21(1); pyschiatrist-prepared report assessing alternatives concluded that none of alternatives would meet respondent’s needs; further, respondent’s bare assertion that he would get his own psychiatrist did not constitute a viable alternative to hospitalization requiring the trial court to order less restrictive treatment.

        Subsection (2) of this section did not require a finding that a patient’s noncompliance with her alternative treatment order was willful before the order could be terminated; hence, where the patient failed to take medications as required under the order, refused to leave her apartment, refused to allow her outpatient caregiver to enter the apartment, and threatened the caregiver and police, her behavior constituted noncompliance meriting termination of the alternative treatment order.

       Scheduling difficulties may well justify briefly postponing a liberty hearing, though a trial judge’s personal schedule cannot be the sole factor in postponing the hearing and the judge should state on the record what efforts were made to seek another judge for a timely hearing.

       The respondent has the right to an expedited appeal from an order of involuntary commitment or alternative treatment, an order modifying a treatment order, an alternative treatment order or less restrictive treatment order, a continuing treatment order, an order denying a petition for discharge, or an order of transfer. Upon entry of an appealable order, the court shall notify the respondent of the right of appeal and the right to counsel. The notice of appeal must be filed within thirty days after the order has been entered. Such appeal must be to the supreme court and the hearing must be commenced within fourteen days of filing of the notice of appeal.

       <p>
        In involuntary commitment cases, when the supreme court reviews a trial court’s determination that there is clear and convincing evidence that a person requires treatment, the court treats the determination as a finding of fact and will not set it aside unless it is clearly erroneous under N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a). In Interest of M.H., 475 N.W.2d 552, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        A trial court’s determination of clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a person requiring treatment is a finding of fact subject to a “clearly erroneous” standard of review.

        Rules authorizing additional time for action after service of a paper by mail do not extend the time for filing a mental health appeal; however, the time for appeal does not begin until the trial court formally advises respondent of his or her right to appeal. Kadrmas v. A.O., 443 N.W.2d 624, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        Trial court’s issuance of 30-day extension to appeal order for continuing treatment had effect of granting extension of 90 days from actual notice of entry of an appealable order rather than 30-day extension from date of order granting extension, so appeal filed within 90-day extension was timely filed.

The court shall appoint counsel for the respondent upon receipt of the petition, unless retained counsel has appeared on behalf of the respondent.

If there is a disagreement between the experts, lack of a satisfactory report from one expert, or another reason to think that an involuntary patient may no longer need treatment, then a trial court should hold an evidentiary hearing upon periodic review.

        When an independent examiner reports that the involuntary patient continues to need treatment, thus concurring with the corresponding report of the facility’s examiner, usually there is no factual dispute to decide under this section. Hence, there is no need for a trial court to find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions in order to summarily deny a discharge. In Interest of T.

       <p>
        When the reason for denial of a petition for discharge is undisputed, that is, when there is no evidence to indicate that the involuntary patient may no longer be a “person requiring treatment,” there is no reason for the trial court to repeat the experts’ reasons in order to act.

       Because the record did not show that appellant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to counsel, an order committing him to treatment in the state hospital for one year and allowing the State to involuntarily medicate him was reversed. The record did not demonstrate that appellant was made aware of the disadvantages of pro se representation at a March 16, 2006 hearing. Appellant’s comments that he thought he understood his right to an attorney, coupled with his subsequent comments, should have put the district court on notice that he was possibly not making his choice with eyes open; even if appellant validly waived his right to counsel at the March 16 hearing, the proceedings at the March 23 hearing should also have included another colloquy to determine appellant’s competence to waive counsel.

       The superintendent or director of a treatment facility may transfer, or authorize the transfer of, an involuntary patient from a hospital to another facility if the superintendent or director determines it would be consistent with the medical needs of the patient to do so. Due consideration must be given to the relationship of the patient to family, legal guardian, or friends, so as to maintain relationships and encourage visits beneficial to the patient. If a treatment facility licensed by any state for the care and treatment of persons who are mentally ill or individuals with a substance use disorder agrees with the patient or patient’s guardian to accept the patient for treatment, the superintendent or director of the treatment facility shall release the patient to the other facility.

      <li id="t25c25-03.1s25-03.1-34ol12">
       Upon receipt of notice from an agency of the United States that facilities are available for the care or treatment of any individual ordered hospitalized who is eligible for care or treatment in a treatment facility of that agency, the superintendent or director of the treatment facility may cause the individual’s transfer to that agency of the United States for treatment. An individual may not be transferred to any agency of the United States if the individual is confined pursuant to conviction of any felony or misdemeanor or the individual has been acquitted of the charge solely on the ground of mental illness unless the court originally ordering confinement of the individual enters an order for transfer after appropriate motion and hearing. An individual transferred under this section to an agency of the United States is deemed committed to that agency under the original order of treatment.

       A facility may not transfer a patient to another hospital or agency without first notifying the patient and the patient’s legal guardian, spouse, or next of kin, if known, or a chosen friend of the patient and the court that ordered treatment. The patient must be given an opportunity to protest the transfer and to receive a hearing on the protest. The patient’s objection to the transfer must be presented to the court where the facility is located or to a representative of the facility within seven days after the notice of transfer was received. If the objection is presented to a representative of the facility, the representative shall transmit the objection to the court. The court shall set a hearing date, which must be within fourteen days of the date of receipt of the objection. If an objection has not been filed or the patient consents to a transfer, the court may enter an ex parte order authorizing transfer.

       <p>
        In reviewing propriety of patient’s transfer from one inpatient facility to another inpatient facility, the trial court’s role was to determine if there was a preponderance of evidence showing the transfer would be consistent with patient’s medical needs and that due consideration was given to patient’s relationship with family and friends. This evaluation had to take into account the opinions of the mental health professionals charged with patient’s care. In Interest of R.N., 492 N.W.2d 582, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Evidence as to the nature of appellant’s mental illness and its volatile and explosive characteristics, evoking behavior that was aggressive, uncontrollable and unpredictable, held to constitute clear and convincing evidence that any treatment outside of the hospital setting was not appropriate for appellant at the present time and would not be adequate to meet his treatment needs or to prevent harm to others. In Interest of Palmer, 363 N.W.2d 401, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported trial court’s conclusion respondent required treatment and that out patient treatment was appropriate; by ordering out patient treatment, trial court did not imply treatment was not required, since out patient treatment was ordered so respondent would receive medication necessary to prevent seizures and stabilize his mood, so that he would not pose a risk of harm. Avard v. K.J.L. (In Interest of K.J.L.), 541 N.W.2d 698, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        The availability and appropriateness of alternative treatment other than hospitalization was not fairly considered. Waters v. R.M. (In the Interest of R.M.), 555 N.W.2d 798, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of an involuntary commitment, the district court did not err in ordering that the patient continue her treatment at the state hospital because she presented a serious risk of harm to herself as she suffered from a disorder which substantially impaired her self-control, judgment and discretion in the conduct of personal affairs and social relations; and the psychologist testified that without the supervised medication the patient was likely to regress to a similar state in which she was initially found, putting herself at risk of injury or death; and because alternative treatment would not presently be adequate to meet the patient’s needs for treatment or to prevent harm to herself or others. Pryatel v. Doe (In re Doe), 2019 ND 23, 921 N.W.2d 403, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        This section does not authorize an appeal to the supreme court of a district court’s order denying a writ of habeas corpus; involuntary committed mental patient’s proper procedure for securing a writ of habeas corpus from the supreme court is to file an original application with such court.

       </h5>
       <p>
        An individual who is found by a trial court to be a “person requiring treatment” has a right to be submitted to the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the purposes of treatment. In Interest of Rosenthal, 392 N.W.2d 796, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 394</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where neither a licensed psychiatrist nor a clinical psychologist testified in continued commitment proceedings, but only a physician, and only a physician’s report was filed with the petition, neither specifically identifying or incorporating the details of a report by a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist evaluating appellants mental illness, and while the evidence was far from clear and convincing that commitment to the state hospital was necessary, in view of the physician’s testimony that a nursing home would be suitable, if financial assistance were available, the order of indefinite commitment would be reversed, and the case would be remanded for a new hearing consistent with statutory requirements, at which the availability and appropriateness of alternative treatment in a less restrictive institution, such as a nursing home, would be fairly considered. In Interest of Goodwin, 366 N.W.2d 809, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 315</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where both sides were advocating alternative treatment, and the district court ordered such treatment, the respondent’s right to the least restrictive conditions necessary for the purposes of treatment had not been violated. Arevalo v. M.S. (In the Interest of M.S.), 1999 ND 117, 594 N.W.2d 924, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        A patient has the right to the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve the treatment purposes; however, in some cases, a reporting doctor may reasonably conclude that less restrictive alternatives to hospitalization simply to dot exist. Pryatel v. J.S. (In the Interest of J.S.), 2002 ND 7, 638 N.W.2d 45, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Injectable form of Haloperidol was necessary only if the patient refused to take his oral medication; thus, the inclusion of that anti-psychotic drug in the order for treatment with medication under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-40 was supported by the evidence and was not clearly erroneous.
   N.D. State Hosp. v. D.A. (In the Interest of D.A.), 2005 ND 116, 698 N.W.2d 474, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the patient argued that as part of the least restrictive conditions for his involuntary treatment under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.1-40(2), he should have been allowed to work outside of a state hospital, the supreme court found that he remained a risk if left unsupervised and allowing him to work ran counter to the continuing treatment order.

      The rights enumerated in subsections 5, 6, 7, and 8 of section 25-03.1-40 may be limited or restricted by the treating physician, physician assistant, psychiatrist, advanced practice registered nurse, or psychologist trained in a clinical program, if in that individual’s professional judgment to do so would be in the best interests of the patient and the rights are restricted or limited in the manner authorized by the rules adopted pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t25c25-03.1s25-03.1-46" target="_self">25-03.1-46</a></cite>. When a physician, physician assistant, psychiatrist, advanced practice registered nurse, or psychologist trained in a clinical program responsible for treatment of a particular patient imposes a special restriction on the rights of the patient as authorized by the rules, a written order specifying the restriction and the reasons for the restriction must be signed by the physician, physician assistant, psychiatrist, advanced practice registered nurse, or psychologist trained in a clinical program and attached to the patient’s chart. These restrictions must be reviewed at intervals of not more than fourteen days and may be renewed by following the procedure set out in this section.

        The statutory scheme for commitment of sexually dangerous individuals is not a criminal punishment and thus commitment under N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 does not violate a defendant’s double jeopardy rights. Grosinger v. M.D. (In the Interest of M.D.), 1999 ND 160, 598 N.W.2d 799, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>
        The creation of a civil procedure for involuntary commitment of sexually dangerous individuals under N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 did not violate double jeopardy; therefore, an offender convicted of several sexual offenses was properly committed after several evaluations.

        North Dakota’s civil commitment framework for sexually dangerous individuals under N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 was not impermissibly punitive in nature because it conformed to all of the requirements of Hendricks, as it contained procedural and evidentiary safeguards for affected individuals. N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) required that the individual’s dangerous condition be manifested by a sexual disorder, personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction, and by requiring the connection between the dangerous condition and a mental disorder, ch. 25-03.3 narrowed the class of affected individuals to those with impairments rendering them dangerous beyond their conduct.

        Appellate court retained jurisdiction, and remanded a district court’s order denying an individual’s petition for discharge from civil commitment as a sexually dangerous individual, because the district court’s findings were inadequate to permit appellate review. The district court was instructed to make specific findings of fact on whether the individual was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct and whether the individual had serious difficulty in controlling behavior.

        Evidence that the defendant had had repeated contact with underage boys, including the victim involved in his conviction for gross sexual imposition, his failure to complete sex offender treatment while in prison and after his release, together with expert testimony that he suffered from paraphilia, with a fixation on adolescent boys and was likely to commit sexually predatory conduct in the future, established he was a sexually dangerous person. Grosinger v. M.D. (In the Interest of M.D.), 1999 ND 160, 598 N.W.2d 799, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>
        Court properly committed a patient as a sexually dangerous individual where two experts diagnosed him with pedophilia, sexual sadism, and antisocial personality disorder, and he was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct. Bertsch v. D.V.A. (In the Interest of D.V.A.), 2004 ND 57, 676 N.W.2d 776, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where State presented two experts who testified respondent, who was found to be a sexually dangerous individual, suffered from disorders, which made him likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct, the district court’s order of commitment was supported by clear and convincing evidence.
   Feland v. B.V. (In re B.V.), 2006 ND 22, 708 N.W.2d 877, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Dakota construes the definition of a sexually dangerous individual in N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) to mean that proof of a nexus between the requisite disorder and dangerousness encompasses proof that the disorder involves serious difficulty in controlling behavior and suffices to distinguish a dangerous sexual offender whose disorder subjects him to civil commitment from the dangerous but typical recidivist in the ordinary criminal case. That nexus between the requisite disorder and future dangerousness satisfies the due process requirements.
   Van Grinsven v. G.R.H. (In re G.R.H.), 2006 ND 56, 711 N.W.2d 587, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent was properly committed as a sexually dangerous individual because he had a history of sexually predatory conduct and numerous mental diseases that made him likely to re-offend, and the State carried its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent was a sexually dangerous individual. Evaluating psychologists could properly consider circumstances surrounding respondent’s convictions for criminal trespass involving his lurking in and around women’s bedrooms and a conviction for gross sexual imposition that had been reversed on procedural grounds. All sexually predatory conduct, including conduct that did not result in a charge or conviction, may be considered under a N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) analysis. Feland v. P.F. (In the Interest of P.F.), 2006 ND 82, 712 N.W.2d 610, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commitment as a sexually dangerous person was affirmed because the evidence in the record clearly and convincingly established that the claimant had a congenital or acquired condition that was manifested by a sexual disorder, a personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction and that the disorder made the claimant likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct, and the claimant could not show he was prejudiced by the delay in holding the commitment hearing, when the State petitioned to commit him while he was still incarcerated for gross sexual imposition.
   Feland v. J.M. (In the Interest of J.M.), 2006 ND 96, 713 N.W.2d 518, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        State proved that a patient was a sexually dangerous individual because experts concluded that he engaged in sexually predatory conduct, he had a “severe” or “significant” antisocial personality disorder, and all three experts found the required nexus or “causative connection” between the patient’s personality disorder and his dangerousness by noting his impulse-control problems as evidenced by the 1998 and 2000 incidents as well as the many fights and “write-ups” he had while incarcerated. Experts stressed the significance of the patient’s failure to complete sex offender treatment and concluded that the patient was a sexually dangerous individual.
   State v. Anderson (In re Anderson), 2007 ND 50, 730 N.W.2d 570, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 47</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order committing respondent as a sexually dangerous individual pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) was upheld where the constitutional right to confrontation did not apply to civil commitments of sexually dangerous individuals; respondent was afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the psychologists and to point out strengths and weaknesses of the psychological evaluations.
   State v. Midgett (In re Midgett), 2007 ND 198, 742 N.W.2d 803, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order committing respondent as a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01 was affirmed because respondent’s antisocial personality disorder made him likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct, and his failure to complete sex offender treatment and an alcohol treatment program increased his risk levels overall.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where the victim in respondent’s gross sexual imposition conviction was a seven-year-old female, the first element of the sexually dangerous individual test was met.
   Gaddie v. Barrera (In re Barrera), 2008 ND 25, 744 N.W.2d 744, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where all three experts diagnosed respondent as having an antisocial personality disorder, based on numerous factors outlined in each expert’s individual report, the second element of the sexually dangerous individual test was met.
   Gaddie v. Barrera (In re Barrera), 2008 ND 25, 744 N.W.2d 744, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court had the ultimate decision to determine whether the State had met its burden of producing clear and convincing evidence sufficient for commitment, and a psychological test could not act as a substitute for independent judicial review; thus, the fact that the actuarial tests did not indicate respondent was statistically likely to re-offend was of little consequence in determining whether there was clear and convincing evidence to support his conviction.
   Stokes v. Hehn (In re Hehn), 2008 ND 36, 745 N.W.2d 631, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was clear and convincing evidence to support the district court’s conclusion that respondent was a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8), where, based on a diagnosis of hebephilia and psychopathy, two experts concluded that respondent was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct that constituted a danger to the safety of others, and testimony by the others at the hearing, including respondent’s probation officer and community members who had filed complaints, supported the expert determinations.
   Stokes v. Hehn (In re Hehn), 2008 ND 36, 745 N.W.2d 631, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent was entitled to a remand of the order finding him a sexually dangerous individual and committing him under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) because the district court did not address the due process consideration and made conclusory and general findings of fact on the statutory elements, which did not comply with N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a).

       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of appellant’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual was appropriate pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) because he failed to progress in treatment, he had a sexual relationship with a young-looking resident in violation of the treatment program rules, and he showed a lack of empathy for his victims.

       </p>
       <p>
        Patient’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual was properly denied because the State of North Dakota proved by clear an convincing evidence that the patient remained a sexually dangerous individual under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-18(4). One expert concluded that the patient remained a sexually dangerous individual and a second acknowledged that if the age of certain victims was proper a diagnosis of sexual perversion of sexual attraction to adolescents would be justified.

       </p>
       <p>
        Order civilly committing appellant as a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 was affirmed because the trial court properly found a nexus between appellant’s disorders and sexual dangerousness, the trial court properly interpreted the evidence presented at the commitment hearing, and the trial court did not commit reversible procedural error by failing to set aside sufficient time during appellant’s first commitment hearing.

        District court’s finding that defendant was a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) was supported by clear and convincing evidence because the complainant and two licensed psychologists testified and there was evidence from which the district court could have found that defendant had uncontrolled anger, rage and reduced impulse control and that a nexus existed between defendant’s diagnosed disorders and dangerousness which established serious difficulty in controlling defendant’s behavior sufficient to distinguish defendant from other ordinary criminal recidivists. Furthermore, the court’s decision satisfied the substantive due process requirements.

       <p>
        Patient was committed as a sexually dangerous individual based on his molestation of two boys, alleged raped of a woman, sexual assault of two girls, and rape of a developmentally disabled adult female; when he petitioned for discharge under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-18(1), the only evidence presented was a doctor’s expert testimony that the patient had a high risk for reoffending. His diagnosis was based on the patient’s failure to follow rules, deceitfulness about past sex offenses, impulsivity, aggression, lack of remorse, and irresponsibility regarding his treatment; the district court did not err by denying the patient’s petition for discharge, because the doctor’s expert testimony proved that the patient continued to be a sexually dangerous individual within the meaning of N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8).
   Cass County State's Atty. v. O.H.W. (In re O.H.W.), 2009 ND 194, 775 N.W.2d 73, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in denying defendant’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual as the State presented sufficient evidence to show defendant was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct which constituted a danger to physical or mental health or safety of others, N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8).
   State v. T.O. (In re T.O.), 2009 ND 209, 776 N.W.2d 47, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 213</cite> (N.D. 2009).

       <p>
        Civil commitment order ruling that appellant was a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) for siring three children with two daughters, molesting one grandson, showing pornography to another grandson/son, and impregnating a 16-year-old was overturned because the district court made a legal error by finding that incest between consenting adults fell within the statutory definition of sexually predatory conduct under N.D.C.C.§ 25-03.3-01(9) and by omitting findings related to the first and second prongs of the analysis used to determine if appellant was a sexually dangerous individual.
   State v. Voisine (In re Voisine), 2010 ND 17, 777 N.W.2d 908, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        State presented clear and convincing evidence to establish that a sex offender’s commitment as a sexually dangerous person was necessary because he had serious difficulty controlling his behavior. The State presented evidence that the sex offender engaged in grooming behavior and flattery when dealing with a female therapist, that he touched a female volunteer who came to the prison for a religious retreat in violation of the rules, and that he did not recognize that his behavior was inappropriate; this evidence, coupled with the expert opinion of an examining forensic psychologist that the sex offender was unable to control his behavior, constituted clear and convincing evidence to support his commitment. That a competing expert opined that the sex offender could control his behavior did not warrant a different result because the responsibility of resolving credibility issues and weighing the evidence was vested in the district court.
   Hanenberg v. Hanenberg, 2010 ND 8, 777 N.W.2d 62, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of petitioner’s request for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual was proper, as a psychologist testified that petitioner’s pedophilia and antisocial personality disorder were lifelong disorders that could be controlled with the right treatment, but that petitioner had not yet successfully completed treatment or even advanced beyond the Basic Skills, or pre-treatment, program.
   State v. Midgett (In re Midgett), 2010 ND 98, 783 N.W.2d 27, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order that respondent remain committed to a state hospital as a sexually dangerous individual was upheld because a finding under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) that respondent suffered from the sexual disorders of paraphilia and fetishism and therefore had a congenital or acquired condition manifested by a sexual disorder was not clearly erroneous.
   Feland v. A.M. (In re A.M.), 2010 ND 163, 787 N.W.2d 752, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 165</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sexually dangerous individual is defined under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) as an individual who is shown to have engaged in sexually predatory conduct and who has a congenital or acquired condition that is manifested by a sexual disorder, a personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction that makes that individual likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct which constitute a danger to the physical or mental health or safety of others. Additionally, the United States Supreme Court has held that commitment as a sexually dangerous individual is unconstitutional unless the person is found to have serious difficulty controlling his or her behavior; therefore, consistent with N.D.C.C. § 1-02-38(1), the definition of a sexually dangerous individual is construed to require a connection between the disorder and dangerousness, including evidence showing the person has serious difficulty controlling his behavior, which distinguishes a sexually dangerous individual from other dangerous persons.

       </p>
       <p>
        All sexually predatory conduct may be considered in an analysis under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8), including conduct not resulting in a charge or conviction.
   Maedche v. Maedche, 2010 ND 171, 788 N.W.2d 331, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not clearly err in concluding that there was clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) because: (1) the district court reasonably considered the results of a specific test that both experts used to classify appellant as a high risk individual; and (2) the district court’s consideration of the experts’
   testimony was also reasonable. It was proper for the experts to consider appellant’s admissions in treatment, and they had a wealth of other information on which to form their opinions, including their own interviews of appellant.
   G.R.H. v. G.R.H., 2011 ND 21, 793 N.W.2d 460, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner was not entitled to discharge from treatment as a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8), as a doctor’s report and testimony supported the district court’s finding that petitioner remained a sexually dangerous individual and had serious difficulty controlling petitioner’s behavior, including petitioner’s sexual behavior, which distinguished petitioner from a typical recidivist in an ordinary criminal case.
   G.L.D. v. G.L.D., 2011 ND 52, 795 N.W.2d 346, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 49</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying petitioner’s motion for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous person because the State did not fail to prove that he had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior or fail to establish a nexus between his antisocial personal disorder and his future dangerousness; while one expert opined that petitioner was not likely to reoffend, the trial court did not err in rejecting that opinion on the ground that the expert did not adequately consider petitioner’s actual behavior and lack of progress in sex offender treatment. Where another expert opined that petitioner was highly likely to reoffend if released and where the record established that petitioner acted inappropriately toward hospital staff, violated the rules of his treatment program, made minimal progress in his sex offender treatment, showed no empathy for his victims, and had psychopathic traits that made him impulsive, sensation-seeking, irresponsible, and violative of social and legal norms, the district court did not err in concluding that petitioner had serious difficulty controlling his behavior and would be likely to reoffend if discharged.
   Burdick v. Wolff (In re Wolff), 2011 ND 76, 796 N.W.2d 644, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a sexually dangerous individual proceeding, the district court’s denial of the patient’s discharge petition was not clearly erroneous; the court gave more weight to the testimony and report of the State’s expert than the testimony and reports of patient’s experts and made detailed findings, including credibility determinations and references to the evidence relied on.
   Enget v. J.T.N. (In re J.T.N.), 2011 ND 231, 807 N.W.2d 570, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied respondent’s petition for discharge from civil commitment because the State established by clear and convincing evidence that he remained a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8); he was diagnosed with pedophilia, was terminated from a treatment program, and lacked insight into his condition.
   Erickson v. Rubey (In re Rubey), 2012 ND 133, 818 N.W.2d 731, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) in denying appellant’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous person because there was evidence that he had difficulty controlling his behavior and was likely to reoffend; he made statements in treatment during the review period that he would take advantage of an underage black male if he knew he would not get caught.
   Assistant State's Atty. v. M.D. (In re Grosinger), 2012 ND 261, 825 N.W.2d 838, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 266</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in not striking the testimony and opinion of the State’s expert witness about whether the patient remained a sexually dangerous individual under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) because her admitted failure to review the patient’s entire file at the state hospital went to the weight of her opinion and not to its admissibility, and her testimony established an adequate factual basis for her opinion.
   Suhr v. J.M. (In re J.M.), 2013 ND 11, 826 N.W.2d 315, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Committed man’s claim had to be rejected in a case involving the denial of the committed man’s petition for discharge that the trial court had erred in determining that the committed man had not engaged in N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) sexually predatory conduct, as well as the finding that the committed man remained a sexually dangerous individual as defined under that statute. The claim about not having engaged in sexually predatory conduct was barred by res judicata since it had been previously decided, and the evidence, including the reports of two experts, supported a finding that the committed man was still a sexually dangerous individual.
   Grosinger v. J.G., 2013 ND 26, 827 N.W.2d 341, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court was unable to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in limiting evidence as to elements of the sexually dangerous individual analysis because an individual who was civilly committed as a sexually dangerous individual failed to make an offer of proof when his expert’s testimony was limited, and the expert’s report was silent as to one of the elements.
   Erickson v. Rubey, 2013 ND 190, 838 N.W.2d 446, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that an individual who was civilly committed as a sexually dangerous individual remained sexually dangerous was not clearly erroneous because its preference for a doctor’s opinions regarding the individual’s risk factors was not an erroneous view of the law. Erickson v. Rubey, 2013 ND 190, 838 N.W.2d 446, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported an inmate’s civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person because, inter alia, the inmate did not contest that the inmate had been convicted of sexually predatory offenses under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(9). Wamstad v. Mangelsen, 2014 ND 31, 843 N.W.2d 8, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 2014), op. withdrawn, 884 N.W.2d 748, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported an inmate’s civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person because, inter alia, a finding that the inmate had serious difficulty controlling the inmate’s sexual behavior, under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8), did not have to be based solely on conduct of a sexual nature, so other misconduct was properly considered. Wamstad v. Mangelsen, 2014 ND 31, 843 N.W.2d 8, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 2014), op. withdrawn, 884 N.W.2d 748, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported an inmate’s civil commitment as a sexually dangerous person because, inter alia, the fact that the inmate’s prior sexual convictions involved “low level” sexual offenses did not bar finding the inmate to be a sexually dangerous individual. Wamstad v. Mangelsen, 2014 ND 31, 843 N.W.2d 8, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 2014), op. withdrawn, 884 N.W.2d 748, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil commitment order was supported by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner had serious difficulty controlling his behavior because evidence existed of his long-term predatory conduct, his lack of treatment, the long-term possession of child pornography, persistent efforts to develop relationships with children and an inability to abide by his terms of probation. Wamstad v. Corman (In the Interest of Corman), 2014 ND 88, 845 N.W.2d 335, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil commitment order was supported by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner’s mental disorder made him likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct because a physician’s report stated that he was diagnosed with pedophilia, hebephilia, and narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial traits, risk assessment instruments indicated he posed a high risk of future sexually offensive behavior, he had not participated adequately in sex offender treatment, and he was unmanageable on probation. Wamstad v. Corman (In the Interest of Corman), 2014 ND 88, 845 N.W.2d 335, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence existed supporting the district court’s finding that the State showed a nexus between petitioner’s sexual and personality disorders and his lack of control, distinguishing him from the typical recidivist in an ordinary case, and therefore the district court did not err by finding clear and convincing evidence that petitioner had serious difficulty controlling his behavior. Grosinger v. Thill, 2014 ND 89, 845 N.W.2d 330, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that petitioner was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct was supported by clear and convincing evidence because a physician found that petitioner’s test results placed him in the high-risk range for re-offense, another test score indicated a high existence of psychopathy and placed him at a greater risk for recidivism, and it was the physician’s opinion that petitioner had not received sufficient treatment. Grosinger v. Thill, 2014 ND 89, 845 N.W.2d 330, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported the district court's finding that a committed individual was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct which constituted a danger to the physical or mental health or safety of others, as required by N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8), given the conflicting expert opinions. Grosinger v. J.G., 2015 ND 207, 869 N.W.2d 108, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court's finding that defendant was a sexually dangerous individual was supported by clear and convincing evidence because defendant was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct and had difficulty controlling his behavior; defendant failed to complete his program of treatment, he lacked support in the community if he was released and supervision, and his diagnosis of pedophilia and antisocial personality disorder made the likelihood of re-offending likely. Whitetail v. Whitetail, 2015 ND 206, 868 N.W.2d 833, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 230</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in denying defendant's petition for discharge from civil commitment as a sexually dangerous individual because, while the State met its burden of showing that defendant engaged in sexually predatory conduct and had sexual disorders characterized as pedophilic disorder and sexual sadism disorder, the district court relied on a mistaken belief that defendant had a conviction after completion of sex offender treatment defendant, and the court did not identify the facts on which it relied in determining defendant's likelihood to engage in further sexual predatory conduct or the facts on which it relied in determining defendant had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. Grosinger v. Thill (In re Thill), 2015 ND 295, 872 N.W.2d 617, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 307</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was no error to deny an inmate discharge from a civil commitment as a sexually dangerous individual because (1) the inmate had prior sexually predatory conduct and a sexual disorder, and (2) experts agreed the inmate was likely to engage in further such conduct and had serious difficulty controlling the inmate's behavior. De La Cour v. D.W., 2016 ND 156, 883 N.W.2d 444, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court, which denied appellant's petition for discharge from a state hospital, was not clearly erroneous in finding there was a sufficient nexus between appellant's sexual disorder of other specified paraphilic disorder and his dangerousness and that he had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior. Byers v. Voisine (In the Interest of Voisine), 2016 ND 254, 888 N.W.2d 781, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court's findings supporting petitioner's civil commitment as a sexually dangerous individual were inadequate to enable appellate review where the court had not made specific findings that he was likely to engage in further sexually predatory conduct or had serious difficulty controlling his behavior, and the evidence did not permit such findings. Olson v. Nelson (In the Interest of Nelson), 2017 ND 28, 889 N.W.2d 879, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alleged sexually dangerous person's civil commitment was reversed because findings did not show a likelihood to engage in further sexually predatory conduct or serious difficulty controlling behavior, despite evidence of past sexually predatory conduct and a congenital or acquired condition manifested by a sexual disorder, a personality disorder, or other mental disorder, as (1) conduct occurring 23 years ago was too remote to show likelihood to engage in sexually predatory conduct in the future, (2) the presence of a mental disorder alone was not clear and convincing evidence of such likelihood, and (3) describing the disorder's characteristics did not prove serious difficulty in controlling behavior. Olson v. Nelson (In the Interest of Nelson), 2017 ND 152, 896 N.W.2d 923, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence showed an alleged sexually dangerous individual was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct because (1) the individual's diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder was characterized by opportunistic and predatory offending, impulsivity, deceitfulness, and a lack of remorse or empathy for victims, predisposing the individual to act impulsively and disregard others' wishes to achieve the individual's own ends, (2) the individual acted out sexually during the relevant review period after being warned and reprimanded, and (3) the individual had serious difficulty controlling the individual's behavior, as the individual acted out sexually in a highly restrictive environment where the individual knew the individual was observed. Tanner v. Tanner, 2017 ND 153, 897 N.W.2d 901, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that respondent had a sexual disorder, personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction was affirmed where its findings and order made clear that it had considered both experts’ opinions and found the State’s expert more credible and persuasive given its consistency with other expert opinions. Byers v. Voisine (In the Interest of Voisine), 2018 ND 181, 915 N.W.2d 647, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that respondent was likely to reoffend was affirmed where the State’s expert testified that he had seen no or extremely minimal treatment progress, and the analysis of respondent’s expert was not as comprehensive and was based on her belief that respondent had been misdiagnosed by at least four other experts. Byers v. Voisine (In the Interest of Voisine), 2018 ND 181, 915 N.W.2d 647, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that respondent had trouble controlling his behavior was affirmed given the lack of meaningful progress in treatment and respondent’s failure to engage in behavior modification work. Byers v. Voisine (In the Interest of Voisine), 2018 ND 181, 915 N.W.2d 647, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inmate’s request for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual was properly denied because clear and convincing evidence demonstrated statutory factors and the Crane factor, as (1) expert testimony showed the inmate had a likelihood to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct, and (2) the inmate had difficulty controlling the inmate’s behavior, as the inmate acquired stimulating prohibited materials when on the verge of being released into the community, jeopardizing the inmate’s release. State v. Carter (In the Interest of Carter), 2019 ND 67, 924 N.W.2d 112, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying petitioner discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual, the district court’s findings of fact were not sufficient to permit appellate review on the elements of likely to reoffend and serious difficulty controlling behavior, and the district court was instructed to make specific findings of fact on these elements. Lawyer v. T.A.G. (In the Interest of T.A.G.), 2019 ND 115, 926 N.W.2d 702, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>

        Individual committed as sexually dangerous was entitled to discharge because (1) the State showed no nexus between the individual’s disorder and sexual dangerousness to others, and (2) a district court’s denial of the petition did not specifically find the individual was any more dangerous than other released convicts, as actuarial test scores were not enough to require continued commitment, limited rule infractions did not show a connection between a disorder and a likelihood of sexually reoffending, and the record established the individual had not acted out sexually, had not had any rule violations that were sexual in nature, and had either completed sex offender treatment or made substantial progress since a last evaluation, so the record did not establish a propensity towards sexual violence of such a degree as to pose a threat to others. Lawyer v. J.M. (In re J.M.), 2019 ND 125, 927 N.W.2d 422, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inmate’s petition for discharge from a civil commitment was properly denied because the State proved by clear and convincing evidence the inmate had serious difficulty controlling the inmate’s behavior based on the inmate’s history of irritability and aggressiveness, physical violence, sexual violence and verbal aggression towards others, pervasive disregard for others’ rights, and absence of remorse for the inmate’s actions all related to the inmate’s mental disorders affecting the inmate’s capacity to control the inmate’s sexual behavior. Murray v. J.B. (In the Interest of J.B.), 2019 ND 258, 934 N.W.2d 538, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 263</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taken together, both petitioner’s past and present conduct, the district court’s finding petitioner had serious difficulty controlling his behavior was not clearly erroneous and was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Review of the record reflected more than just lack of progress, it showed a lack of participation in treatment. Fremgen v. Didier (In re Didier), 2019 ND 263, 934 N.W.2d 417, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence did not support the finding that appellant remained a sexually dangerous individual where he had participated in treatment and was not a management problem, and instances of having extra food in his room did not establish a serious difficulty controlling behavior. Moreover, the lack of behavioral write-ups, progress in treatment, and the lack of evidence about how he remained a threat ran counter to finding by clear and convincing evidence that he had serious difficulty in controlling his sexual behavior. Evidence that a 76-year-old man whose first language was not English, was on medication for his heart condition, and sometimes appeared asleep in group alone was insufficient to meet the requirement for commitment. Voisine v. Voisine, 2019 ND 302, 936 N.W.2d 544, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 308</cite> (N.D. 2019).

         Sexually Predatory Conduct.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Denial of a committed individual’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual was appropriate because his argument that he had not committed any acts of sexually predatory conduct while at the State Hospital for four years, as defined in
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(9), was without merit since such a requirement did not exist for the continued civil commitment of a sexually dangerous individual. Rather, the State had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the individual remained a sexually dangerous individual, as defined in
   N.D.C.C. §§ 25-03.3-01(8) and
   25-03.3-18(4), and the State had done so.
   Cass County State's Attorney v. R.A.S. (In re R.A.S.), 2009 ND 101, 766 N.W.2d 712, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Incest between consenting adults is not sexually predatory conduct under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(9).
   State v. Voisine (In re Voisine), 2010 ND 17, 777 N.W.2d 908, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in finding that respondent remained a sexually dangerous individual as both experts reached the conclusion that respondent was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct if he were released. Hehn v. Hehn, 2013 ND 191, 838 N.W.2d 469, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2013).

If the court determines after a preliminary hearing that there is probable cause to believe the respondent is a sexually dangerous individual, the court shall order that the respondent be transferred to an appropriate treatment facility for an evaluation as to whether the respondent has a congenital or acquired condition that is manifested by a sexual disorder, a personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction that makes the respondent likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct. If the court determines that probable cause does not exist to believe that the respondent is a sexually dangerous individual, the court shall dismiss the petition. If the respondent waives the preliminary hearing, then the respondent must be immediately transferred to an appropriate treatment facility for an evaluation as to whether the respondent has a congenital or acquired condition that is manifested by a sexual disorder, a personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction that makes the respondent likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct.

    Sexually dangerous individual — Commitment proceeding — Report of findings.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Within sixty days after the finding of probable cause, the court shall conduct a commitment proceeding to determine whether the respondent is a sexually dangerous individual. The court may extend the time for good cause. At the commitment proceeding, any testimony and reports of an expert who conducted an examination are admissible, including risk assessment evaluations. Any proceeding pursuant to this chapter must be tried to the court and not a jury. At the commitment proceeding, the state’s attorney shall present evidence in support of the petition and the burden is on the state to show by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is a sexually dangerous individual. An individual may not be committed unless expert evidence is admitted establishing that the individual has a congenital or acquired condition that is manifested by a sexual disorder, a personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction that makes that individual likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct. The respondent has a right to be present, to testify, and to present and cross-examine witnesses. If the respondent is found to be a sexually dangerous individual, the court shall commit the respondent to the care, custody, and control of the executive director. The executive director shall place the respondent in an appropriate facility or program at which treatment is available. The appropriate treatment facility or program must be the least restrictive available treatment facility or program necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. The executive director may not be required to create a less restrictive treatment facility or treatment program specifically for the respondent or committed individual. Unless the respondent has been committed to the legal and physical custody of the department of corrections and rehabilitation, the respondent may not be placed at and the treatment program for the respondent may not be provided at the state penitentiary or an affiliated penal facility. If the respondent is found not to be a sexually dangerous individual, the court shall discharge the respondent.

        The statutory scheme for commitment of sexually dangerous individuals is not a criminal punishment and thus commitment under N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 does not violate a defendant’s double jeopardy rights. Grosinger v. M.D. (In the Interest of M.D.), 1999 ND 160, 598 N.W.2d 799, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-13, which authorizes the executive director of the North Dakota Department of Human Services to determine the least restrictive treatment, does not negate the civil nature of the law and does not violate the double jeopardy provisions of the state and federal constitutions; moreover, there are pre-commitment and post-commitment safeguards designed to protect liberty interests as a person proceeds through the treatment process, so due process is also not violated.
   Van Grinsven v. G.R.H. (In re G.R.H.), 2006 ND 56, 711 N.W.2d 587, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 did not violate equal protection, as applied to an inmate who was committed as a sexually dangerous individual, regardless of the level of scrutiny applied, because the state had a compelling interest in protecting the public, and the inmate failed to show that the legislature was not justified in treating mentally ill and sexually dangerous individuals differently.
   Feland v. P.F (In re P.F.), 2008 ND 37, 744 N.W.2d 724, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-13 does not violate equal protection by treating the commitment of sexually dangerous individuals differently from the commitment of mentally ill or chemically dependent individuals, given the differences in the potential level of danger posed to society by these groups. The state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexually dangerous individuals, who pose a heightened risk to society, especially children, which justifies the classification and differences in the treatment of sexually dangerous individuals, and the distinct procedures and safeguards set forth in § 25-03.3-13 further the state’s interest in protecting the public.
   Feland v. P.F (In re P.F.), 2008 ND 37, 744 N.W.2d 724, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-13 does not violate equal protection by treating the commitment of sexually dangerous individuals differently from the commitment of mentally ill or chemically dependent individuals by removing the determination of the least restrictive treatment available treatment program facility from the district court and giving it to the executive director of the department of human services, given the differences in the potential level of danger posed to society by these groups. The state has a compelling interest in protecting the public from sexually dangerous individuals, who pose a heightened risk to society, especially children, which justifies the classification and differences in the treatment of sexually dangerous individuals, and the distinct procedures and safeguards set forth in § 25-03.3-13 further the state’s interest in protecting the public.

        Because defendant did not argue in the district court that a hospital had “withheld” treatment as punishment in violation of his statutory and constitutional rights, the supreme court would not address that issue on appeal.

         Expert Testimony.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Court properly admitted experts’ opinions in a sexually dangerous individual’s commitment where the patient did not produce any evidence indicating that the information relied upon by the experts was not reasonably relied upon by psychologists in determining whether an individual was sexually dangerous; further, the weakness or nonexistence of a basis for an expert’s opinion went to his credibility and not necessarily to the admissibility of the opinion evidence. Bertsch v. D.V.A. (In the Interest of D.V.A.), 2004 ND 57, 676 N.W.2d 776, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court, in its discretion, could consider the relevant testimony of any qualified expert at trial, and, in considering the totality of the evidence, it could rely on the testimony of an expert witness called by a defendant in arriving at a decision to commit the individual as a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t25c25-03.3s25-03.3-13" target="_self">25-03.3-13</a></cite>.
   O'Donnell v. L.D.M. (In re L.D.M.), 2005 ND 177, 704 N.W.2d 838, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 206</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where State presented two experts who testified respondent, who was found to be a sexually dangerous individual, suffered from disorders, which made him likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct, the district court’s order of commitment was supported by clear and convincing evidence.
   Feland v. B.V. (In re B.V.), 2006 ND 22, 708 N.W.2d 877, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not clearly err in concluding that there was clear and convincing evidence that appellant was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) because: (1) the district court reasonably considered the results of a specific test that both experts used to classify appellant as a high risk individual; and (2) the district court’s consideration of the experts’
   testimony was also reasonable. It was proper for the experts to consider appellant’s admissions in treatment, and they had a wealth of other information on which to form their opinions, including their own interviews of appellant.
   G.R.H. v. G.R.H., 2011 ND 21, 793 N.W.2d 460, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court found that a doctor’s opinion was more credible than another expert’s, which was reflected in the district court’s determination that appellant was a sexually dangerous individual, and the court would not second-guess the district court’s credibility determination. Reierson v. Johnson (In re Johnson), 2013 ND 146, 835 N.W.2d 806, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 2013).

       <p>
        Where the psychiatric expert had been unable to complete his evaluation of the defendant and the attorney handling the case had been ill and out of the office for two weeks, there was good cause for the 30-day extension of the commitment hearing date granted by the district court. Grosinger v. M.D. (In the Interest of M.D.), 1999 ND 160, 598 N.W.2d 799, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State’s failure to move for an extension of the commitment hearing date until after the original 30-day period had expired did not deprive the court of authority to consider whether there was good cause to extend the time for the hearing. Grosinger v. M.D. (In the Interest of M.D.), 1999 ND 160, 598 N.W.2d 799, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in holding a civil commitment hearing more than 60 days after the probable cause finding when several delays were attributable to respondent; these delays were caused by respondent’s continual requests to change the independent evaluator.
   Feland v. B.V. (In re B.V.), 2006 ND 22, 708 N.W.2d 877, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a sexually dangerous person individual commitment case, a court properly extended the hearing deadline on the sixty-first day where the State Hospital issued a letter to the district court indicating its inability to complete the psychiatric assessments due to scheduling constraints, an extension was requested, and the court ordered the respondent’s release in the interim.
   Feland v. P.F. (In the Interest of P.F.), 2006 ND 82, 712 N.W.2d 610, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a sexually dangerous person commitment proceeding, the court did not err in finding good cause for the extension of the proceeding because, absent the patient’s motion for a continuance to obtain an independent evaluation, the commitment hearing would have been delayed only 18 days beyond the statutory deadline; the patient caused the bulk of the delay. Furthermore, by not opposing the State’s motion for a continuance, the patient’s counsel essentially eliminated the need for a hearing on the matter of good cause for the extension.
   State v. Anderson (In re Anderson), 2007 ND 50, 730 N.W.2d 570, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 47</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appellant’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous person, the court did not err in granting the State’s motion for a continuance because its expert witness had a medical emergency and was not available to testify.

       <p>
        In a patient’s sexually dangerous person commitment proceeding, the patient was not denied the right to a trial by jury because the involuntary civil commitment provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.3 created a statutory proceeding that was unknown at the time that the North Dakota Constitution was adopted in 1889. Consequently, there was no right to a jury trial.

        Evidence that the defendant had had repeated contact with underage boys, including the victim involved in his conviction for gross sexual imposition, his failure to complete sex offender treatment while in prison and after his release, together with expert testimony that he suffered from paraphilia with a fixation on adolescent boys and was likely to commit sexually predatory conduct in the future, established he was a sexually dangerous person. Grosinger v. M.D. (In the Interest of M.D.), 1999 ND 160, 598 N.W.2d 799, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Phrase “likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct” as used in this section means that the person’s propensity towards sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a threat to others. Grosinger v. M.B.K. (In re M.B.K.), 2002 ND 25, 639 N.W.2d 473, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent was properly committed as a sexually dangerous individual because he had a history of sexually predatory conduct and numerous mental diseases that made him likely to re-offend, and the State carried its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent was a sexually dangerous individual. Evaluating psychologists could properly consider circumstances surrounding respondent’s convictions for criminal trespass involving his lurking in and around women’s bedrooms and a conviction for gross sexual imposition that had been reversed on procedural grounds. All sexually predatory conduct, including conduct that did not result in a charge or conviction, may be considered under a N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) analysis. Feland v. P.F. (In the Interest of P.F.), 2006 ND 82, 712 N.W.2d 610, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commitment as a sexually dangerous person was affirmed because the evidence in the record clearly and convincingly established that the claimant had a congenital or acquired condition that was manifested by a sexual disorder, a personality disorder, or other mental disorder or dysfunction and that the disorder made the claimant likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct, and the claimant could not show he was prejudiced by the delay in holding the commitment hearing, when the State petitioned to commit him while he was still incarcerated for gross sexual imposition.
   Feland v. J.M. (In the Interest of J.M.), 2006 ND 96, 713 N.W.2d 518, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that defendant was a sexually dangerous individual under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) was supported by clear and convincing evidence because the complainant and two licensed psychologists testified and there was evidence from which the district court could have found that defendant had uncontrolled anger, rage and reduced impulse control and that a nexus existed between defendant’s diagnosed disorders and dangerousness which established serious difficulty in controlling defendant’s behavior sufficient to distinguish defendant from other ordinary criminal recidivists. Furthermore, the court’s decision satisfied the substantive due process requirements.
   Cass County State's Atty. v. Vantreece (In re Vantreece), 2009 ND 152, 771 N.W.2d 585, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 162</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order that respondent remain committed to a state hospital as a sexually dangerous individual was upheld because a finding that respondent suffered from the sexual disorders of paraphilia and fetishism and therefore had a congenital or acquired condition manifested by a sexual disorder was not clearly erroneous.
   Feland v. A.M. (In re A.M.), 2010 ND 163, 787 N.W.2d 752, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 165</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order finding that respondent remained a sexually dangerous individual and continuing respondent’s civil commitment was proper because the State presented evidence that respondent’s treatment at the N.D. State Hospital was the least restrictive program available, given respondent’s diagnosis of mild mental retardation and respondent’s level of cognitive functioning.
   Whelan v. A.O., 2011 ND 26, 793 N.W.2d 471, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied respondent’s petition for discharge from civil commitment because the State established by clear and convincing evidence that he remained a sexually dangerous individual; he was diagnosed with pedophilia, was terminated from a treatment program, and lacked insight into his condition.
   Erickson v. Rubey (In re Rubey), 2012 ND 133, 818 N.W.2d 731, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that appellant was a sexually dangerous individual was supported by the record, as the doctor’s diagnosis was based on her review of appellant’s records and the interview she conducted with him, and the conclusion that appellant had a disorder manifested by a sexual disorder or dysfunction was not clearly erroneous because it was established in the testimony and a report. Reierson v. Johnson (In re Johnson), 2013 ND 146, 835 N.W.2d 806, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court properly found that respondent was a sexually dangerous individual and ordered his commitment because respondent showed he had serious difficulty controlling his disorder and reoffended sexually on the same victims, probation or sex offender treatment did not act as a guard for the victims, and respondent continued to accumulate write ups while incarcerated for his second set of offenses. Binder v. Whitetail (In re Whitetail), 2013 ND 143, 835 N.W.2d 827, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court was unable to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in limiting evidence as to elements of the sexually dangerous individual analysis because an individual who was civilly committed as a sexually dangerous individual failed to make an offer of proof when his expert’s testimony was limited, and the expert’s report was silent as to one of the elements.

       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that an individual who was civilly committed as a sexually dangerous individual remained sexually dangerous was not clearly erroneous because its preference for a doctor’s opinions regarding the individual’s risk factors was not an erroneous view of the law.

        District court’s order requiring petitioner’s civil commitment was supported by clear and convincing evidence because it showed that he had a congenital or acquired condition, hebephilia, that was manifested by a sexual disorder and a factual basis existed for a physician’s diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial traits.

        Civil commitment order was supported by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner’s mental disorder made him likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct because a physician’s report stated that he was diagnosed with pedophilia, hebephilia, and narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial traits, risk assessment instruments indicated he posed a high risk of future sexually offensive behavior, he had not participated adequately in sex offender treatment, and he was unmanageable on probation.

        District court did not clearly err in civilly committing defendant as a sexually dangerous individual because the State proved that he remained a sexually dangerous individual where he had previously engaged in sexually predatory conduct, both expert witnesses diagnosed him with having a congenital or acquired condition that was manifested by a sexual, personality, or other mental disorder or dysfunction making him likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct, and the experts agreed in the results of the examinations using methodology accepted in the profession.

        District court did not err in refusing to order that the individual be committed to the Community Transitional Center as the least restrictive treatment facility or program, as required by N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-13, where the evidence showed that although he had made some progress, he had not successfully completed a sex offender treatment program, thus making transition to the Center inappropriate.

        District court's finding that defendant was a sexually dangerous individual was supported by clear and convincing evidence because defendant was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct and had difficulty controlling his behavior; defendant failed to complete his program of treatment, he lacked support in the community if he was released and supervision, and his diagnosis of pedophilia and antisocial personality disorder made the likelihood of re-offending likely.

        When an inmate civilly committed as a sexually dangerous individual claimed the inmate suffered from a certain condition and that the North Dakota State Hospital should be required to treat that condition, the claim failed because the North Dakota State Hospital could not be required to create an individualized treatment program for the inmate. De La Cour v. D.W., 2016 ND 156, 883 N.W.2d 444, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Individual committed as sexually dangerous was entitled to discharge because (1) the State showed no nexus between the individual’s disorder and sexual dangerousness to others, and (2) a district court’s denial of the petition did not specifically find the individual was any more dangerous than other released convicts, as actuarial test scores were not enough to require continued commitment, limited rule infractions did not show a connection between a disorder and a likelihood of sexually reoffending, and the record established the individual had not acted out sexually, had not had any rule violations that were sexual in nature, and had either completed sex offender treatment or made substantial progress since a last evaluation, so the record did not establish a propensity towards sexual violence of such a degree as to pose a threat to others.

        District court erred in ordering defendant to be civilly committed as a sexually dangerous individual because it was unclear whether the State offered a psychologist’s expert report into evidence, and the district court’s order was silent on whether it was part of the hearing record.

        In a civil commitment proceeding, a trial court abused the court’s discretion in denying an inmate’s counsel’s request to have the inmate’s shackles removed, when the court deferred to a sheriff’s determination that the inmate should be shackled, because (1) the court did not independently make an individualized determination on the record as to whether the inmate’s restraints were necessary, (2) it was not suggested on the record that the inmate presented a security risk, (3) reports of examining professionals did not refer to any act of violence the inmate committed, and (4) the State did not meet the State’s burden to establish the need for restraints, deferring instead to the sheriff.

       <p>
        In a civil commitment proceeding, when a trial court abused the court’s discretion in denying an inmate’s counsel’s request to have the inmate’s shackles removed, the error was not harmless because (1) the inmate’s continued commitment was based on expert testimony, and the experts did not agree, (2) the experts agreed that the inmate had no sexual deviancy, and (3) the use and acceptance of risk assessment instruments used to determine the inmate’s dangerousness were in flux, so the tools’
   application to an individual had to be carefully scrutinized.

        N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-17 does not violate the separation of powers doctrine by unconstitutionally delegating judicial authority to the executive director of the department of human services.

        Inmate, who was committed as a sexually dangerous individual, did not have standing to challenge N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-17(1), on the basis that the statute represented a practical impediment to discharge; he petitioned for discharge under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-18, and yet he did not show that he was denied release by the district court based upon the decision of the executive director of the department of human services. Rather, he was denied discharge upon the district court’s finding that he continued to suffer from a severe antisocial disorder and had not received sex offender treatment; consequently, the inmate did not show that the district court delegated its authority to decide whether to continue his commitment to the executive director, and thus did not show that N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-17 was unconstitutional as applied to him.

        District court erred in extending res judicata to the question whether a committed individual had a congenital or acquired condition manifested by a sexual disorder, personality disorder or other mental disorder or dysfunction; although the patient’s expert was presenting his previously expressed disagreement with the patient’s original diagnoses, the fact did not change the potential effect his expert opinion may have had on the patient’s diagnoses in 2013, and his testimony should not have been excluded on res judicata grounds.

        Trial court did not err in denying the petition for discharge from civil commitment as a sexually danger individual, as the experts’ reliance on the State Hospital’s behavioral acknowledgments or write-ups was not unreasonable and petitioner’s objection went to the report’s weight rather than its admissibility.

        State complied with the statutory requirements under N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-17(2) when a hospital staff psychologist completed a patient’s annual evaluation and submitted the report to the district court; even though the report was not admitted during the patient’s discharge hearing, it was part of the record and readily available for the district court’s review because it was filed with the district court.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Order denying appellant’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous person was improper because the trial court did not comply with N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) and its finding was inadequate to permit appellate review; the trial court’s finding was general and conclusory, and merely stated that the State sustained its burden of proof.
   Cass County State's Attorney v. R.A.S. (In re R.A.S.), 2008 ND 185, 756 N.W.2d 771, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that an individual who was civilly committed as a sexually dangerous individual remained sexually dangerous was not clearly erroneous because its preference for a doctor’s opinions regarding the individual’s risk factors was not an erroneous view of the law. Erickson v. Rubey, 2013 ND 190, 838 N.W.2d 446, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in denying defendant's petition for discharge from civil commitment as a sexually dangerous individual because, while the district court determined defendant engaged in sexually predatory conduct as evidenced by his prior convictions, suffered from antisocial personality disorder, and presented a high risk for re-offending, it did not make any specific findings on whether defendant remained a sexually dangerous individual or whether he had serious difficulty in controlling his behavior, and an analysis of defendant's past criminal history, alone, was insufficient.
   Reierson v. Johnson (In re Johnson), 2015 ND 71, 861 N.W.2d 484, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Individual committed as sexually dangerous was entitled to discharge because (1) the State showed no nexus between the individual’s disorder and sexual dangerousness to others, and (2) a district court’s denial of the petition did not specifically find the individual was any more dangerous than other released convicts, as actuarial test scores were not enough to require continued commitment, limited rule infractions did not show a connection between a disorder and a likelihood of sexually reoffending, and the record established the individual had not acted out sexually, had not had any rule violations that were sexual in nature, and had either completed sex offender treatment or made substantial progress since a last evaluation, so the record did not establish a propensity towards sexual violence of such a degree as to pose a threat to others. Lawyer v. J.M. (In re J.M.), 2019 ND 125, 927 N.W.2d 422, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence did not support the finding that appellant remained a sexually dangerous individual where he had participated in treatment and was not a management problem, and instances of having extra food in his room did not establish a serious difficulty controlling behavior. Moreover, the lack of behavioral write-ups, progress in treatment, and the lack of evidence about how he remained a threat ran counter to finding by clear and convincing evidence that he had serious difficulty in controlling his sexual behavior. Evidence that a 76-year-old man whose first language was not English, was on medication for his heart condition, and sometimes appeared asleep in group alone was insufficient to meet the requirement for commitment. Voisine v. Voisine, 2019 ND 302, 936 N.W.2d 544, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 308</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court remanded, while retaining jurisdiction, with instructions that a district court make required specific findings of fact because the district court’s conclusory general findings in denying a petition for discharge from civil commitment as a sexually dangerous individual were insufficient for civil commitment decisions. Kummer v. Hehn (In re Hehn), 2020 ND 226, 949 N.W.2d 848, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 207</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Conclusion that a patient continued to be sexually dangerous individual was supported by the evidence which included the patient’s prior gross sexual imposition conviction and the State psychologist’s testimony that the patient suffered from two sexual disorders, that the patient had not completed sex offender treatment, and that the patient still engaged in inappropriate sexual behavior while in treatment.
   Cass County State's Atty. v. E.W.F. (In re E.W.F.), 2008 ND 130, 751 N.W.2d 686, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of appellant’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-18(1) was appropriate because he failed to progress in treatment, he had a sexual relationship with a young-looking resident in violation of the treatment program rules, and he showed a lack of empathy for his victims.
   Grosinger v. M.D. (In re M.D.), 2008 ND 208, 757 N.W.2d 559, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Patient’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual was properly denied because the State of North Dakota proved by clear an convincing evidence that the patient remained a sexually dangerous individual under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-18(4). One expert concluded that the patient remained a sexually dangerous individual and a second acknowledged that if the age of certain victims was proper a diagnosis of sexual perversion of sexual attraction to adolescents would be justified.
   Van Grinsven v. G.R.H. (In re G.R.H.), 2008 ND 222, 758 N.W.2d 719, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 203</cite> (N.D. 2008).

       <p>
        Denial of a committed individual’s petition for discharge under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-18(4) from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8) was appropriate because the State proved by clear and convincing evidence that the committed individual had difficulty controlling his actions and that when he had been conditionally released in the past, he had not done well and had committed multiple sex crimes.
   Cass County State's Attorney v. R.A.S. (In re R.A.S.), 2009 ND 101, 766 N.W.2d 712, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of a committed individual’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual was appropriate because his argument that he had not committed any acts of sexually predatory conduct while at the State Hospital for four years, as defined in
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(9), was without merit since such a requirement did not exist for the continued civil commitment of a sexually dangerous individual. Rather, the State had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the individual remained a sexually dangerous individual, as defined in
   N.D.C.C. §§ 25-03.3-01(8) and
   25-03.3-18(4), and the State had done so.
   Cass County State's Attorney v. R.A.S. (In re R.A.S.), 2009 ND 101, 766 N.W.2d 712, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the district court’s order denying defendant’s petition for discharge from commitment as a sexually dangerous individual was not induced by an erroneous view of the law and was supported by clear and convincing evidence that defendant remained a sexually dangerous individual, the district court did not clearly err in denying defendant’s petition.
   Feland v. A.M. (In re A.M.), 2009 ND 104, 766 N.W.2d 437, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 2009).

       <p>
        Patient was committed as a sexually dangerous individual based on his molestation of two boys, alleged raped of a woman, sexual assault of two girls, and rape of a developmentally disabled adult female; when he petitioned for discharge under
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-18(1), the only evidence presented was a doctor’s expert testimony that the patient had a high risk for reoffending. His diagnosis was based on the patient’s failure to follow rules, deceitfulness about past sex offenses, impulsivity, aggression, lack of remorse, and irresponsibility regarding his sex offender treatment; the district court did not err by denying the patient’s petition for discharge, because the doctor’s expert testimony proved that the patient continued to be a sexually dangerous individual within the meaning of
   N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-01(8).
   Cass County State's Atty. v. O.H.W. (In re O.H.W.), 2009 ND 194, 775 N.W.2d 73, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court’s finding that petitioner was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct was supported by clear and convincing evidence because a physician found that petitioner’s test results placed him in the high-risk range for re-offense, another test score indicated a high existence of psychopathy and placed him at a greater risk for recidivism, and it was the physician’s opinion that petitioner had not received sufficient treatment. Grosinger v. Thill, 2014 ND 89, 845 N.W.2d 330, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence existed supporting the district court’s finding that the State showed a nexus between petitioner’s sexual and personality disorders and his lack of control, distinguishing him from the typical recidivist in an ordinary case, and therefore the district court did not err by finding clear and convincing evidence that petitioner had serious difficulty controlling his behavior.

        District court erred in extending res judicata to the question whether a committed individual had a congenital or acquired condition manifested by a sexual disorder, personality disorder or other mental disorder or dysfunction; although the patient’s expert was presenting his previously expressed disagreement with the patient’s original diagnoses, the fact did not change the potential effect his expert opinion may have had on the patient’s diagnoses in 2013, and his testimony should not have been excluded on res judicata grounds. Hetland v. Graham (In the Interest of Graham), 2013 ND 171, 837 N.W.2d 382, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        District court did not err in finding that respondent remained a sexually dangerous individual as both experts reached the conclusion that respondent was likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct if he were released. Hehn v. Hehn, 2013 ND 191, 838 N.W.2d 469, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>

        District court did not clearly err in civilly committing defendant because the State proved that he remained a sexually dangerous individual where he had previously engaged in sexually predatory conduct, both expert witnesses diagnosed him with having a congenital or acquired condition that was manifested by a sexual, personality, or other mental disorder or dysfunction making him likely to engage in further acts of sexually predatory conduct, and the experts agreed in the results of the examinations using methodology accepted in the profession.

       <p>
        Supreme court was unable to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in limiting evidence as to elements of the sexually dangerous individual analysis because an individual who was civilly committed as a sexually dangerous individual failed to make an offer of proof when his expert’s testimony was limited, and the expert’s report was silent as to one of the elements.
   Erickson v. Rubey, 2013 ND 190, 838 N.W.2d 446, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taken together, both petitioner’s past and present conduct, the district court’s finding petitioner had serious difficulty controlling his behavior was not clearly erroneous and was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Review of the record reflected more than just lack of progress, it showed a lack of participation in treatment. Fremgen v. Didier (In re Didier), 2019 ND 263, 934 N.W.2d 417, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        Appellant, who was committed as a sexually dangerous individual, was not entitled to a discharge hearing pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 25-03.3-18(2) because appellant failed to petition for discharge.
   Feland v. D.V.A. (In re D.V.A.), 2009 ND 75, 764 N.W.2d 417, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in concluding that respondent was not entitled to another discharge hearing until 12 months had passed since the last discharge hearing because the statute unambiguously provided that a committed individual was only entitled to one discharge hearing within a 12-month period.

        The statutory condition that a district court could order community placement of a sexually dangerous individual only when the Executive Director of the North Dakota Department of Human Services filed a petition requesting community placement did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. Therefore, because the individual rather that the Executive director petitioned for community placement of the individual, the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to consider the individual’s petition.

        District court did not err by concluding it lacked authority to place defendant on extended supervision because the executive director of the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Field Services Division did not petition for community placement; the restrictions and requirements for committed individuals were for a committed individual placed in the community as ordered by the district court after petition from the executive director.

     </p>
     <ol>

     </ol>
     <p>
      If the court is in doubt as to whether the child is a candidate for services offered at the life skills and transition center, the court may make an order committing the child to the life skills and transition center for observation only by the authorities of such institution. If it is ascertained as a result of such observation that the child is a candidate for services offered at the life skills and transition center, a report to such effect must be made by the authorities of the life skills and transition center to the court. The court thereupon shall make an order fixing a time for a hearing upon the report showing the child to be in need of these services. Notice of the hearing must be given to the parents, custodian, or guardian of such child in the manner prescribed by law for the giving of notice in other proceedings in juvenile court. Upon such hearing, the court shall make such order as it may deem proper. Any parent, custodian, guardian, or other person charged with the control of such child may take an appeal from the order made by the court in the manner now prescribed by law for the taking of appeals from decisions of the juvenile court. The procedure provided in this section is not exclusive but is in addition to other procedures provided in this chapter for the commitment of children to the life skills and transition center.

      No statute of limitations or similar statute or the doctrine of laches may bar the recovery of costs of care furnished under this chapter. It is not necessary to bill currently any person for those accounts determined to be inactive, currently uncollectible, or for which it has been determined as provided by law that there is no present ability to pay. Current billings may be made for amounts chargeable by law or for which it has been determined the responsible party presently has an ability to pay, but the manner of billing may not affect the total amount due.

        ARTICLE I

      </p>
      <p>
       The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.

If the medical or other appropriate clinical authorities having responsibility for the care and treatment of the patient in the sending state shall have reason to believe that after-care in another state would be in the best interest of the patient and would not jeopardize the public safety, they shall request the appropriate authorities in the receiving state to investigate the desirability of affording the patient such after-care in said receiving state, and such investigation shall be made with all reasonable speed. The request for investigation shall be accompanied by complete information concerning the patient’s intended place of residence and the identity of the person in whose charge it is proposed to place the patient, the complete medical history of the patient, and such other documents as may be pertinent.

      If the driver of a motor vehicle approaches an individual who is blind or visually impaired and who is carrying a cane predominately white or metallic in color, with or without a red tip, or who is accompanied by a service animal, the driver shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid injury to the individual and the service animal.

If the mentally disordered offender is a patient in a receiving state, the appropriate authorities of the sending state, upon recommendation of the appropriate authorities in the receiving state, shall, if they concur in the recommendation, file the petition contemplated by this paragraph.

       <b>
        2.

       The court shall hold a hearing on the petition within thirty days of the filing thereof. Such hearing shall be only to determine whether the proper safeguarding and advancement of the public interest, the condition of the mentally disordered offender, and the prospects for more satisfactory care, treatment, and rehabilitation of the offender warrant disposition of the untried indictment, information, or complaint prior to termination of the defendant’s status as a mentally disordered offender in the sending state. The prosecuting officer of the jurisdiction from which the untried indictment, information, or complaint is pending, the petitioning authorities, and such other persons as the court may determine shall be entitled to be heard.

In granting or denying any such adjournment or continuance, the court shall give primary consideration to the purposes of this compact, and more particularly to the need for expeditious determination of the legal and mental status of a mentally disordered offender so that the offender’s care, treatment, and discharge to the community only under conditions which will be consonant with the public safety may be implemented.

The mentally disordered offender shall, at all times, remain in the custody of the sending state. Any acts of officers, employees, or agencies of the receiving state in providing or facilitating detention, housing, or transportation for the mentally disordered offender shall be only as agents for the sending state.

Otherwise, the court shall make such order with respect to the petition and the untried indictment, information, or complaint as may be appropriate in the circumstances and consistent with the status of the defendant as a mentally disordered offender in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state.

        1.
       </b>
       Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove a patient from the receiving state there is pending against the patient within such state any criminal charge or if the patient is suspected of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the patient shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment, or detention for such offense.

In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for return shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For-profit treatment or care centers may compensate working owners and their families for time worked on behalf of the treatment or care center. The amount of total annual compensation allowed for an owner acting in an executive or administrative capacity must be limited as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Number of clients served: Compensation limit:
   1 - 15 $25,000
   16 - 30 $35,000

   46 + $50,000
     </p>
     <p>
      Click to view
     </p>
     <p>
      The limits in this section are intended to be the total compensation allowed by this state in any one year regardless of the number of owners performing work for the treatment or care center. A proration of the total compensation for owners who perform services in this state and who perform services in other states must be made on the basis of individual time distribution records. For family members working in direct care, housekeeping, maintenance, dietary, or clerical positions, wages are limited to the wage paid to any nonrelated employee, with the same qualifications and experience, working in a similar job function for that treatment or care center. The allowable compensation limit is inclusive of all salaries and related fringe benefits and may not be construed to be an addition or enhancement to the rate payable to a treatment or care center.
