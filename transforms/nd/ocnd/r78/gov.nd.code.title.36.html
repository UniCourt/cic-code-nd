       The state veterinarian, or the state veterinarian’s designee, a police officer, sheriff, or other law enforcement officer may seize any nontraditional livestock located on private property from the animal’s owner or custodian if probable cause exists to believe that the animal is being held in violation of this chapter or rules adopted under this chapter. Unless it is shown that there exists an exigency or occasion as to require the immediate confiscation, an animal may not be seized until a hearing is held allowing the owner or custodian to show cause why the animal should not be confiscated.

Within twenty-four hours after receiving notice of the order, the owner or keeper may file a protest against the killing of the animal with the board or with the person who has ordered the animal killed. The protest must state under oath that, to the best of the knowledge and belief of the person making the protest, the animal is not infected with any contagious or infectious disease. An examination of the animal or laboratory reports involved then must be made by three experts, one of whom must be appointed by the board, one by the person making the protest, and the third by the two thus appointed. All the experts must be persons learned in veterinary medicine and surgery and graduates of the veterinary course of a recognized college or university.

      No member of a cooperative grazing association is permitted to graze more than five hundred animal units during a full twelve-month period in any one year. A member may be permitted, however, to graze a correspondingly larger number for a shorter grazing period during each year.

        Business Judgment Rule.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The business judgment rule applies to actions taken by a grazing association, and trial courts refrain from interfering with or regulating their directors’ conduct so long as it is in the reasonable and honest exercise of their judgment, which is in turn not influenced by personal consideration. Review of the trial court’s findings is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Dixon v. McKenzie County Grazing Ass'n, 2004 ND 40, 675 N.W.2d 414, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 2004), overruled in part, Strand v.

     <p>
      If the person suffering damage because of the trespass of livestock which has been taken up under this chapter does not know the name of the owner or keeper of the livestock, the person may bring an action against an unknown defendant. In such case, service must be made by publication of a copy of the summons, with a notice attached, stating the nature of the action, in at least one issue of a legal newspaper if one is published within the county, and if not, by posting copies of the summons and notice in three public places within the county. The publication or posting must be made at least ten days before the date of the trial. If it appears on the trial of any action brought to recover damages arising from the trespass of livestock that the person named in the action and upon whom the summons was served is not the owner or person in charge of the offending livestock, the action must be dismissed as to that person, and service must be made, and the action must proceed, as in a case in which the name of the owner or keeper of the offending livestock is unknown.

    Requirements governing the issuance of certificates.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The certificate certifying to a test made under this chapter must be made on official federal or state blanks and must accompany the shipment to its destination. When an original certificate is made, two copies of the certificate must be mailed immediately to the state veterinarian. The failure of a veterinarian to mail two copies of each certificate relating to livestock to be shipped into this state to the state veterinarian is sufficient cause to refuse acceptance of any more certificates from that person. The owner or owners of the livestock must have a copy of the certificate to show on the demand of any federal or state official.

     <p>
      Whenever any animal has been adjudged by the board to be diseased, the board or its authorized agent shall serve a written notice of its decision upon the owner or keeper of the animal before the condemned animal is killed. The animal must be destroyed within fifteen days after notice of condemnation, in either a federally inspected or state-inspected slaughtering plant, or under the supervision of an agent of the board. The fifteen-day period may be extended by the state veterinarian if the state veterinarian determines it advisable due to the circumstances involved in each case. The extension must be in writing. The notice must advise the animal’s owner or keeper of that person’s right to protest against the diagnosis and determination of the board within twenty-four hours after the service of the notice upon the owner or keeper. If no protest is made within that time by the owner or keeper of the condemned animal, the animal must be appraised in the manner provided in this chapter.

     <p>
      Any animal which is found dead must be presumed to have died from a contagious or infectious disease until the contrary is shown unless another cause of death is apparent. The owner or person in charge of any domestic animal or nontraditional livestock which dies within this state from or on account of any contagious or infectious disease shall dispose of the carcass of such animal as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t36c36-14s36-14-19ol11">
       If the animal died of anthrax, as determined by a licensed veterinarian, the carcass must be completely burned at the place where it died if possible. If the carcass must be moved, it may not be dragged over the ground but must be moved only on a suitable conveyor and all body openings in the carcass must be plugged with cotton saturated with a strong antiseptic solution.
      </li>
      <li id="t36c36-14s36-14-19ol12">
       If the carcass is of a hog which died from hog cholera or swine erysipelas, the same, with hide intact, must be burned within thirty-six hours or given to a licensed rendering plant within such time.
      </li>
      <li id="t36c36-14s36-14-19ol13">
       If the carcass is of an animal which has died of a disease other than is specified in subsections 1 and 2, or from any other cause, it must be burned, buried, composted, or given to a licensed rendering plant within thirty-six hours, or must be disposed of by a method approved by the state veterinarian. If the carcass is buried, it must be buried not less than four feet [1.22 meters] below the surface of the ground and covered with dirt to that depth. No carcass may be disposed of along any public highway or along any stream, lake, or river nor be buried near or adjoining any such place.

      If the owner or person in charge of a dead animal fails to comply with the provisions of section 36-14-19, the overseer of highways shall comply with the provisions of section 36-14-19 for the owner or person. If burial of the animal is permitted, the burial may be made upon the premises of the owner or person in charge of the animal at any place more than one thousand feet [304.8 meters] from any dwelling house or barn. The board of county commissioners shall allow in payment a sum for disposal services as it deems to be reasonable, and the sum must be paid as other moneys are paid for services rendered to the county. The owner of the animal is liable to the county for any amount paid out for disposal services. If the owner does not pay that amount within thirty days after written demand for payment is made upon the owner by the county auditor, the sum may be recovered in a civil action, and the judgment must include the costs of the suit and a reasonable attorney’s fee to be fixed by the court. No property except absolute exemptions is exempt from sale for the payment of any such judgment. Any attorney’s fee allowed by the court must be paid to the county if the action is brought by the state’s attorney.

      The return of an appraisal under this chapter must be in writing and signed by the board or by the board’s agent who made the appraisal, or by the members of the board of appraisers if a reappraisal is made after a protest, and by the owner of the condemned animal. The return must be certified by the agriculture commissioner to the office of management and budget. The office of management and budget shall issue a check jointly to the owner and any lienholders of the animal. The amount of indemnity paid by this state to the owner of a diseased animal may not exceed five thousand dollars per animal less any amount obtained by the owner through insurance, federal indemnity payments, or salvage payments. This state is not liable for indemnity under this chapter in excess of the amount approved by the emergency commission for the payment of the indemnity.

     <p>
      Whenever any animal has been adjudged by the board to be infected with bovine tuberculosis or brucellosis, the board or its authorized agent shall serve a written notice of its decision upon the owner or keeper of the animal before the condemned animal is killed. The animal must be destroyed within fifteen days after notice of condemnation, in either a federal-inspected or state-inspected slaughtering plant, or under the supervision of an agent of the board. The fifteen-day period may be extended by the state veterinarian if that person deems it advisable due to the circumstances involved in each case, and the extension must be in writing. The notice must advise the owner or keeper of that person’s right to protest against the diagnosis and determination of the board within twenty-four hours after the service of the notice upon that person. If no protest is made within such time by the owner or keeper of the condemned animal, it must be appraised in the manner provided in this chapter.

     <p>
      The owner of any dog that kills, wounds, or chases any sheep or other domestic animal or poultry belonging to another person is liable to that person for all resulting damages. If more than one dog, owned by different persons, participates in the killing, wounding, or chasing of sheep or other domestic animals or poultry, the owners of the dogs may be sued jointly, and a joint verdict and judgment may be rendered against the owners. If one or more of the defendants pays a joint judgment and if the damages committed by the dogs may be prorated, the payor or payors may receive contribution from the defendants who have not paid.

        Where defendant railroad company shows that there was no negligence or want of ordinary skill and care, prima facie case made by proof of killing is overcome, and it devolves upon plaintiff to show affirmatively that defendant was guilty of gross negligence. Volkman v. Chicago, St. P. M. &amp; O. R. Co., 37 N.W. 731, 5 Dakota 69, 1888 Dakota LEXIS 9 (Dakota 1888); Huber v. Chicago, M. &amp; St. P.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The statutory presumption of negligence may be overcome by showing conclusively, by undisputed evidence, that the train in question at the time of the accident was in good repair and was equipped with the best modern appliances and improvements, and was operated skillfully and with due care. Hodgins v. Minneapolis, St. P. &amp; S.S.M. Ry., 3 N.D. 382, 56 N.W. 139 (1893), distinguished, Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. P. &amp; S.S.M. Ry., 18 N.D. 462, 123 N.W. 281 (1909) and Clair v. Northern Pac. Ry., 22 N.D. 120, 132 N.W. 776, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 24</cite> (N.D. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the plaintiff relies upon the presumption raised by this section without other evidence of negligence, evidence of less weight is required to rebut it than would be necessary if plaintiff made actual proof of negligence. Reinke v. Minneapolis, St. P. &amp; S. St. M. Ry., 23 N.D. 182, 135 N.W. 779, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the facts in regard to a killing are all put in evidence, the presumption of the statute does not apply; the proved facts clear away and supersede all presumptions. Snyder v. Northern Pac. Ry., 69 N.D. 266, 285 N.W. 450, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 1939).

       Dog owner was entitled to a hearing under N.D.C.C. § 36-21.1-06 to determine whether her dogs should be returned or whether she voluntarily relinquished ownership because a relinquishment of ownership form, signed by the owner, was inconsistent with a notice of confiscation, which deputy sheriffs gave to the owner after confiscating her dogs.
