        In the administration of a decedentâs estate where vendor, who had entered into a written contract, died before completing it, and the party entitled to the conveyance had paid or was ready to pay the purchase price, the enforcement of the contract was a special proceeding.

       <p>
        Normally, appeals were allowed, pursuant to N.D.C.C. Â§ 28-27-02, in âactions,â as actions were defined in N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-01-02 and which were generally commenced by the issuance of a summons, as recognized by N.D. R. Civ. P. 3. However, appeals were also allowed from final orders entered in special proceedings, N.D.C.C. Â§ 28-27-02, and the power to subpoena was not an ordinary proceeding but was a special proceeding, which meant that the state human services agency had a right to appeal from the administrative subpoena that it served on the state insurance reserve fund.

Therefore, the statute of limitations imposed by N.D.C.C. Â§ 28-01-16 does not apply to the tax intercept procedure. Guthmiller v. North Dakota Dep't of Human Servs., 421 N.W.2d 469, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1988).

         Similarity of Garnishment to Lien.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Practically speaking, a garnishmentâs purpose is very similar to that of a lien. The garnishment summons requires a garnishee to withhold property for the benefit of a judgment creditor in order that a judgment creditor be satisfied. Generally, garnished property is to be released if the judgment creditor is satisfied with other property or by agreement of the parties. Likewise, a lenderâs reason for obtaining a lien on property is to gain assurance of debt repayment. A lien on property is generally released upon repayment of the obligation on loan. If the obligation is not repayed, the lender may have the right to have the property turned over for debt satisfaction. In re Da-Sota Elevator Co., 135 B.R. 873, 1991 Bankr. LEXIS 1976 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1991).

D'Annunzio, 514 N.W.2d 681, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        District court properly adopted an estateâs accounting of a partnershipâs profits and losses, ordered the estate to pay the decedentâs nephew the remaining balance of his one-fourth interest from the sale of the decedentâs real property, and denied interest on the distribution because none of the partnershipâs financial documents included the nephewâs wage expense in laboring for a partnership in which he, the decedent, and the decedentâs brother were partners, the nephew did not present evidence showing the estate breached an obligation or committed fraud, and his earlier distributions from the estate did not include interest.

        In a tort action, a return of a verdict in excess of the ad damnum is presumed to include interest. Reichert v. Northern Pac. Ry., 39 N.D. 114, 167 N.W. 127, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

    Measure of damages for breach of contract â Damages must be certain.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For the breach of an obligation arising from contract, the measure of damages, except when otherwise expressly provided by the laws of this state, is the amount which will compensate the party aggrieved for all the detriment proximately caused thereby or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom. No damages can be recovered for a breach of contract if they are not clearly ascertainable in both their nature and origin.

        Award of damages to construction company for cost of necessary and agreed changes in contract, which were due to the fact that the city had not prepared site in accordance with specifications, was properly based on total cost of performance, where it was virtually impossible to separate equitable adjustment of consideration from damages and the total cost was supported by substantial evidence.

        Company argued that the district court erred in holding the company liable to the county for prompt payment interest, but this was not ordered, and instead, the district court ordered the company to share in satisfying the damages that flowed from its breach of contract; prompt payment interest was a detriment at least partially caused by the companyâs failure to honor its contractual commitment, the company was not in a position to complain about mitigation of damages, and the damages findings were not clearly erroneous. C&amp;C Plumbing &amp; Heating, LLP v. Williams County, 2014 ND 128, 848 N.W.2d 709, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        Because the estimated cost to repair the property to return it to the condition when the commercial lease began was approximately $2.7 million, and the evidence established the cost of repairing the property was significantly higher than the diminution in value, diminution of value was the correct measure of damages; however, because the evidence established the property was worth the same regardless of whether the repairs were made, there would be no damages under the diminution of value measure, and the district court did not err in failing to award the lessor damages for its breach of contract claim related to the lesseeâs failure to repair the parking area.

        The correct measure of damages due an improperly discharged schoolteacher was his wages for the entire school term less the amount earned or that he could have earned by reasonable efforts in employment obtained after his discharge.

        A school district being sued for breach of employment contract must assume the burden of proving that the wrongfully discharged teacher did not reasonably attempt to minimize his damages by seeking other employment.

        The general rule is that the sellerâs remedy for the buyerâs breach of an executory contract to purchase an ongoing business is to recover damages for the difference between the contract price and the fair market value of the business on the date of the breach. However, in the case of an executed contract, where the seller has fully performed and the buyer has breached by refusing to pay the agreed-upon price, the seller may sue for the full contract price.

        Where an insurer refuses to defend actions against insured arising out of a risk which insurer claims is not covered by the policy, and such risk is thereafter found by the court to be within the policy coverage, the failure to defend is a breach of the insurance contract which renders insurer liable for all costs and expenses incurred by insured in defending the actions.

        Where the lessee did not meet the higher standard required to support an award of specific performance, by clearly showing that the legal remedy of damages was inadequate, and where evidence fell short of proving monetary damages could not have been a sufficient remedy for securing and farming land in another location, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award specific performance.
   The mere uncertainty as to the exact amount does not preclude recovery, yet, damages that are not clearly ascertainable in their nature and origin cannot be recovered pursuant to N.D.C.C.

        In a case in which a farmer sued a property owner for breach of a farm lease, the evidence supported the trial courtâs finding that the farmer unsuccessfully tried to mitigate his damages by looking for other farmland to rent. Even if the farmer had been able to find other farmland to rent, it would not have been replacement land but land to expand his farming operation, and therefore it would not have reduced his damages.

        In an action by a general contractor against a subcontractor for breach of contract, the court did not clearly err in failing to offset the contractorâs damage award by the cost of unused pipe that the contractor purchased and failed to resell and for its refusal to allow the subcontractor to retry the contracted work as the evidence could support view that the leftover pipe could not be sold in the marketplace and that the subcontractorâs proposals to retry the work were not feasible; thus, the finding that the general contractor did not fail to mitigate damages was not clearly erroneous.

        Where a construction company had an oral contract with property owner to pour two concrete driveways on his property and the court had determined that the property owner had acquiesced to a time-and-materials price for the project and where the property owner had claimed a reduction in the balance owed to the construction company based upon a failure to substantially perform the contract, the district court did not err in refusing to reduce the amount owed to the construction company as the owner had not provided sufficient evidence regarding the diminution of value of the driveway to satisfy the requirements of N.D.C.C. Â§ <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t32c32-03s32-03-09" target="_self">32-03-09</a></cite>.
   There was no testimony from any expert regarding the usual life expectancy of similar concrete driveways; the value of this driveway, other than the time-and-materials invoice prepared by the construction company; or the cost of removing and replacing the driveway and, thus, the district court could reasonably conclude that the testimony that the life expectancy was reduced â30-40%â was too speculative to find diminution of value.

    Measure of damages for injury to property not arising from contract.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The measure of damages for injury to property caused by the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, except when otherwise expressly provided by law, is presumed to be the reasonable cost of repairs necessary to restore the property to the condition it was in immediately before the injury was inflicted and the reasonable value of the loss of use pending restoration of the property, unless restoration of the property within a reasonable period of time is impossible or impracticable, in which case the measure of damages is presumed to be the difference between the market value of the property immediately before and immediately after the injury and the reasonable value of the loss of use pending replacement of the property. Restoration of the property shall be deemed impracticable when the reasonable cost of necessary repairs and the reasonable value of the loss of use pending restoration is greater than the amount by which the market value of the property has been diminished because of the injury and the reasonable value of the loss of use pending replacement.

        State had no statutory right to appeal a restitution order in a criminal case because, although an order for restitution affected with finality the Stateâs ability to obtain recompense for a crime victim, the victim could seek recovery of damages independent from any action by the State in a civil action to recover other or additional damages suffered as a result of the crime; and the right of restitution would not be undermined or lost without appellate review as the victim could maintain a civil action seeking recovery of damages.

All rights and obligations under the program are determined by Title 65, N.D.C.C.â Because the Workersâ Compensation Act is comprehensive, the courts do not look to other portions of the Century Code when defining rights and obligations pursuant to it or when construing its provisions.

       <p>
        Defendant's use of plaintiff's property for disposal of off-lease saltwater was intentional and amounted to civil trespass because its use of property for that purpose went beyond its rights under lease. Injunction against further use of property for that purpose was appropriate, and plaintiff was entitled to statutory damages in same amount as would be appropriate if restitution principles were applied, but plaintiff was not entitled to punitive damages because it failed to prove that defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or actual malice.

The injured party is given the benefit of any substantial appreciation in value after the conversion and before the verdict, but has the alternative option to collect interest. National Bank v.

        In seeking damages for conversion, a property owner is required to first elect to utilize either N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-03-23(1) or N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-03-23(2) to establish the value of the property; if the owner elects a return of the converted property, the present value of that property must be considered in mitigation of damages established under subsection 1 or 2 of N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-03-23, and the owner is also entitled to damages under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-03-23(3), which include a fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in pursuit of the property.

        Where, pursuant to the terms of its dealership agreement, the sellers credited the dealers from whom parts were repossessed the current cost to dealers of each part returned, plus a five percent handling charge, the current price paid by dealers was relevant evidence of wholesale value. However, where the dealership agreement clearly provided that the five percent was for packaging the parts for return, not for freight expenses, and no other evidence suggested that freight expenses would equal five percent of the wholesale price, the trial court erred in including the five percent handling charge as part of the wholesale value of the parts in determining damages for conversion of those parts repurchased under the dealership agreement.

        Refusal of elevator to deliver wheat to the plaintiff upon her proper demand therefor was prejudicial and wrongful, and operated as a conversion of the wheat, and would therefore entitle the plaintiff to recover the value of the grain on the date of such demand and refusal with interest. Towne v. St. Anthony &amp; Dakota Elevator Co., 8 N.D. 200, 77 N.W. 608, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1898).

        In an action to recover the value of grain alleged to have been converted by defendant, and upon which the plaintiff had a chattel mortgage, judgment was properly based upon the market value established; but the allowance of costs and expenses of the foreclosure sale was erroneous where mortgagee at no time had possession of the grain or the storage tickets representing it.

        In an action for damages on account of the conversion of grain covered by a chattel mortgage owned by plaintiff, where defendant denied lien, the conversion dated from the time of the purchase of the grain contrary to the terms of the agreement, and it was sufficient to prove the value of the grain at that time as the measure of damages was that value to the extent of plaintiffâs lien with interest from such date.

        In a partnership dispute, a reviewing court did not have to address a trial courtâs interpretation of agricultural land in N.D.C.C. Â§ 47-16-02 because, even assuming there was a possessory interest in a bin site, there was evidence to support the finding that a partner was not ejected from the bin site. The testimony showed that a truck was parked across a road to prevent the removal of equipment, but not to prevent the use of the bins.

        Trial court did not err in concluding that a landlord forcibly ejected a tenant through overt acts where the landlord had twice driven in front of the tenantâs tractor, told him his farm lease was invalid, and threatened to call law enforcement; on both occasions, the tenant or his son stopped working and left the property. The tenant was properly awarded treble damages.

      In estimating damages, except as provided by sections 32-03-33 and 32-03-34, the value of property to a buyer or owner thereof deprived of its possession is deemed to be the price at which the buyer or owner might have bought an equivalent thing in the market nearest to the place where the property ought to have been put into such personâs possession, and at such time after the breach of duty upon which that personâs right to damages is founded as would suffice with reasonable diligence for that person to make such a purchase.

      <li id="t32c32-03.1s32-03.1-01ol11">
       âAid or assistance necessary or helpful in the circumstancesâ means any actions which the aider reasonably believed were required to prevent death or serious permanent injury, disability or handicap, or reasonably believed would benefit the injured or ill person, depending upon the aiderâs perception of the nature and severity of the injury or illness and the total emergency situation, and that the aider reasonably believed the aider could successfully undertake.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-03.1s32-03.1-01ol12">
       âAppropriate person licensed or certified by this state or by any state or province to provide medical care or assistanceâ means any physician, nurse, emergency medical technician, or other medical or paramedical personnel whom the aider reasonably believes is such, based upon the representations of the person or that personâs actions in providing medical aid.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-03.1s32-03.1-01ol13">
       âEmployed expressly or actuallyâ means either that the personâs formal duties include the provision of emergency medical aid, or that the person customarily provides such aid and is informally expected or relied upon to do so in the course of the personâs employment.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-03.1s32-03.1-01ol14">
       âGross negligenceâ means acts or omissions falling short of intentional misconduct which nevertheless show a failure to exercise even slight care or any conscious interest in the predictable consequences of the acts or omissions. For the purposes of this chapter, âgross negligenceâ includes the failure of an aider to relinquish direction of the care of an injured or ill person when an appropriate person licensed or certified by this state or by any state or province to provide medical care or assistance assumes or attempts to assume responsibility for the care of the injured or ill person.

     <p>
      As used in this chapter, âfaultâ includes acts or omissions that are in any measure negligent or reckless toward the person or property of the actor or others, or that subject a person to tort liability or dram shop liability. The term also includes strict liability for product defect, breach of warranty, negligence or assumption of risk, misuse of a product for which the defendant otherwise would be liable, and failure to exercise reasonable care to avoid an injury or to mitigate damages. Legal requirements of causal relation apply both to fault as the basis for liability and to contributory fault.

        Trial court erred in granting judgment on an injured partyâs dram shop claim. The injured party, who claimed that she was pushed to the ground by a bar patron, testified she saw the bar patron drinking beer at the bar earlier that night and noticed signs that would suggest that the bar patron was obviously intoxicated.

       Where the jury found that plaintiffâs damages were proximately caused eighty percent by her own negligence, fifteen percent by defendant and five percent by a third partiesâ negligence, plaintiff, under former section 9-10-07, was precluded from any award of damages.

       Even if the borrowerâs attorney was negligent in signing an opinion letter regarding liens on collateral without an investigation of liens, there was ample evidence in the record to support the trial judgeâs conclusion that the lender was also negligent and that its negligence exceeded that of the attorney.

      Contributory fault does not bar recovery in an action by any person to recover damages for death or injury to person or property unless the fault was as great as the combined fault of all other persons who contribute to the injury, but any damages allowed must be diminished in proportion to the amount of contributing fault attributable to the person recovering. The court may, and when requested by any party, shall direct the jury to find separate special verdicts determining the amount of damages and the percentage of fault attributable to each person, whether or not a party, who contributed to the injury. The court shall then reduce the amount of such damages in proportion to the amount of fault attributable to the person recovering. When two or more parties are found to have contributed to the injury, the liability of each party is several only, and is not joint, and each party is liable only for the amount of damages attributable to the percentage of fault of that party, except that any persons who act in concert in committing a tortious act or aid or encourage the act, or ratifies or adopts the act for their benefit, are jointly liable for all damages attributable to their combined percentage of fault. Under this section, fault includes negligence, malpractice, absolute liability, dram shop liability, failure to warn, reckless or willful conduct, assumption of risk, misuse of product, failure to avoid injury, and product liability, including product liability involving negligence or strict liability or breach of warranty for product defect.

        The rational basis test was applicable to an equal protection challenge to this section. The elimination of joint and several liability under this section affects the amount of damages that an injured party may recover; however, that party is not denied access to the courts. Kavadas v.

        In an action brought by the surviving spouse of a deceased heavy construction equipment operator who was killed when a nine-wheel pneumatic rubber tire roller compactor he was operating rolled over, because the court denied summary judgment to the distributor and the seller on the spouseâs claims of strict products liability, failure to warn, and negligence, in accordance with N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-03.2-02, the jury would be allowed to consider the âfaultâ of each party and assess whether the manner in which the decedent operated the compactor contributed to his injuries and damages would be diminished in proportion to the amount of contributing fault.

        A suicide victimâs fault is considered under this section but if the medical provider, knowing the patient is suicidal and too mentally incapacitated to assume responsibility for his own well-being, undertakes a duty of care to the patient that takes in the patientâs duty of self-care, then the patientâs fault in the act of suicide is greatly reduced. If the patientâs act of suicide is a foreseeable result of the medical providerâs breach of duty to treat the patient, the patientâs act of suicide cannot be deemed a superseding cause of the patientâs death that breaks the chain of causation between the medical provider and the patient, which absolves the medical provider of liability.

        By settling with some tortfeasors in a negligence action, a plaintiff expects to have his or her recovery reduced only by that portion of causal fault attributable to the settling defendants. The plaintiff does not impliedly agree, or expect as a natural consequence of entering into a settlement, that he or she will be forced to absorb portions of causal fault attributable to nonsettling tortfeasors who are either insolvent or statutorily immune from suit. Hoerr v. Northfield Foundry &amp; Mach. Co., 376 N.W.2d 323, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 459</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        By settling with some tortfeasors in a negligence action, the plaintiff waives joint and several liability only between the settling and nonsettling defendants, and the nonsettling defendants may be held jointly and severally liable for the entire portion of causal fault reduced only by that portion of fault attributable to the settling defendants. Hoerr v. Northfield Foundry &amp; Mach. Co., 376 N.W.2d 323, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 459</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        To redistribute a statutorily immune employerâs percentage of fault in a negligence action between all causal parties, where a settlement with some of those parties had already been made, so as to reduce plaintiffâs recovery is contrary to the joint and several liability provisions of this section. Hoerr v. Northfield Foundry &amp; Mach. Co., 376 N.W.2d 323, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 459</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Where employee was injured in a work-related accident resulting from the negligence of his employer, who was 75 percent negligent, and a third party, who was 25 percent negligent, and the employee received workersâ compensation benefits for his injuries and filed an action against the third party in accordance with N.D.C.C. Â§ 65-01-09, the trial court erred in reducing employeeâs damage recovery against the third party by the percentage of negligence attributable to the employer, who was immune from suit because of the workersâ compensation exclusive remedy provision; such reduction of damage recovery was contrary to the express language of former N.D.C.C. Â§ 9-10-07, which retains the doctrine of joint and several liability, permitting the employee to recover his damages in full from the third party. Layman v.

      After an award of economic damages, the party responsible for the payment thereof is entitled to and may apply to the court for a reduction of the economic damages to the extent that the economic losses presented to the trier of fact are covered by payment from a collateral source. A âcollateral sourceâ payment is any sum from any other source paid or to be paid to cover an economic loss which need not be repaid by the party recovering economic damages, but does not include life insurance, other death or retirement benefits, or any insurance or benefit purchased by the party recovering economic damages.

       In any action for the breach of an obligation not arising from contract, when the defendant has been guilty by clear and convincing evidence of oppression, fraud, or actual malice, the court or jury, in addition to the actual damages, may give damages for the sake of example and by way of punishing the defendant. Upon commencement of the action, the complaint may not seek exemplary damages. After filing the suit, a party may make a motion to amend the pleadings to claim exemplary damages. The motion must allege an applicable legal basis for awarding exemplary damages and must be accompanied by one or more affidavits or deposition testimony showing the factual basis for the claim. The party opposing the motion may respond with affidavit or deposition testimony. If the court finds, after considering all submitted evidence, that there is sufficient evidence to support a finding by the trier of fact that a preponderance of the evidence proves oppression, fraud, or actual malice, the court shall grant the moving party permission to amend the pleadings to claim exemplary damages. For purposes of tolling the statute of limitations, pleadings amended under this section relate back to the time the action was commenced.

        Plaintiffs failed to make a showing sufficient to withstand defendantsâ motion for summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages, where there was no evidence indicating that defendantsâ acts were motivated by evil motive or intent or that their acts constituted oppression, fraud, malice or callous or reckless indifference to the rights of others.

        Northbound motoristsâ

        Given the lack of viable substantive claims by a debtorâs customers against a creditor, the customersâ

        Defendant's use of plaintiff's property for disposal of off-lease saltwater was intentional and amounted to civil trespass because its use of property for that purpose went beyond its rights under lease. Injunction against further use of property for that purpose was appropriate, and plaintiff was entitled to statutory damages in same amount as would be appropriate if restitution principles were applied, but plaintiff was not entitled to punitive damages because it failed to prove that defendant acted with oppression, fraud, or actual malice.

        Evidence was sufficient for jury to find insurer guilty of oppression, fraud, or malice, and award exemplary damages, where insurer did not properly investigate claim, alleged insured intended to misrepresent his income in application without evidence of such intent, talked to insured about settlement when he was hospitalized and under medication, threatened to sue if he sought help from an attorney, and suspended his benefits when it knew he was totally disabled.

        Widowâs motion for leave to file an amended complaint to include a claim for punitive damages pursuant to N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-03.2-11 was granted where the evidence submitted by the parties was sufficient, at this stage, to support a finding by the trier of fact that a preponderance of the evidence established that the corporation acted with oppression, fraud, or actual malice because the evidence presented to date arguably showed that (1) the corporationâs engineers were aware of a defective condition that existed; (2) the defective condition was not âdesigned outâ and the speed control cable could stick with an open throttle to varying degrees; (3) the corporation did not adopt the protective boot or grommet that would have arguably âdesigned outâ the defective condition; and (4) the corporation was aware that dirt and debris inside a speed control cable could have caused it to stick and that the application of the brakes when the speed control cable was stuck may not have necessarily overcome a stuck-open throttle.

       </p>
       <p>
        Punitive damage award was proper because defendant insurerâs tortious conduct (labeling plaintiff insured an arsonist based on insufficient grounds) evinced an indifference to or disregard of plaintiffsâ
   financial, emotional, and physical well-being, the insurer knew that plaintiffs were financially vulnerable, and the insurerâs treatment of plaintiffsâ
   claim was typical of how it handled similar claims; the record provided evidence of the reprehensibility of the insurerâs conduct.

        There was evidence to support plaintiffâs claim of punitive damages and overcome summary judgment, where the court found reasonable jurors could conclude that police officersâ conduct in arresting plaintiff was justified, negligent, reckless, grossly negligent or willful; since the officersâ conduct was in dispute, summary judgment rejecting plaintiffâs request for punitive damages was not proper.

        Defendant did not object to the jury being instructed on constructive fraud, did not object to the jury verdict that included a finding on constructive fraud, and did not object to the argument that exemplary damages were warranted at least in part due to constructive fraud; therefore, constructive fraud supporting exemplary damages became law of the case and the district court did not err entering judgment accordingly.

        The fact the legislature reduced the deterrent value of exemplary damages by restricting the extent that wrongdoers could be punished was not persuasive evidence that exemplary damages for conduct occurring before the legislative change was excessive.

        There was no irreconcilable inconsistency between the juryâs award of attorney fees and its findings that employers did not abuse their qualified privilege and that a former employee was not entitled to an award of exemplary damages. The state of mind required for the jury to find no abuse of the qualified privilege and no entitlement to exemplary damages differs from the state of mind required for the jury to award attorney fees.

        Action by an insured against an insurer, which alleged tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, malice, oppression, and fraud predicated on the insurerâs failure to defend the insured in a legal action as required by a provision in the policy, was an action in tort for which exemplary damages could be awarded under former section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t32c32-03s32-03-07" target="_self">32-03-07</a></cite>.

        Under former N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-03-07, a specific finding of oppression, fraud, or malice, actual or presumed, by trier of fact was necessary to support an award of exemplary damages; intentional or willful conduct is not synonymous with fraudulent, oppressive or malicious conduct.

       <p>
        As a prerequisite to an award of punitive damages, the jury must find oppression, fraud, or malice, actual or presumed. Slaubaugh v. Slaubaugh, 466 N.W.2d 573, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>
        The only significant distinction between the torts of fraud and deceit is whether the wrongdoer happens to be a party to a contract. The conduct prohibited under the separate statutory definitions of fraud and deceit is substantially identical and, for purposes of the punitive damages statute (former N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-03-07) fraud and deceit are synonymous. Dewey v. Lutz, 462 N.W.2d 435, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1990).

Â§ 32-03-07 by assignor of oil and gas leases for breach of reassignment clauses by assignee; assignorâs purchase of other leases was a transaction distinct from any rights to leases for a different period of time, and there was no reason assignee should benefit from assignorâs additional effort and investment in a separate transaction.

        Under the statute, where there is no mutual remedy between the parties to a contract, an action for specific performance by a party thereto will not lie unless such party has performed the contract on his part or he can be compelled specifically to perform the same. Knudtson v. Robinson, 18 N.D. 12, 118 N.W. 1051, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1908).

        Where the covenant to pay is independent, an action at law for the purchase price may be maintained, but where the time for the delivery of the deed has arrived before suit is brought for the price, the only action which on principle can be maintained by the vendor is one for specific performance.

        Where a contract for the sale of realty required the purchaser to deliver specified quantities of wheat or the equivalent in money, an action for the purchase price would be the equivalent of an action for specific performance, so there was mutuality of remedy. Pederson v. Dibble, 12 N.D. 572, 98 N.W. 411, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 1904).

        An action for specific performance may be maintained upon a contract for the conveyance of land which is signed only by the vendor. Beddow v. Flage, 22 N.D. 53, 132 N.W. 637, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 1911).

       <p>
        A contract for the sale of real estate ordinarily imports mutuality. The vendor may be compelled by a decree of specific performance to convey according to the terms and conditions provided in the contract or the vendee may be compelled to perform specifically even though his performance consists only of the payment of the purchase price. Alfson v. Anderson, 78 N.W.2d 693, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1956).

        Purchasers who breached agreement for sale of grain elevator by stopping payment of their check were not in position to demand specific performance under this section. Zundel v. Farmers Union Grain Co., 79 N.W.2d 48, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1956).

        Lack of mutuality did not preclude a purchaser from seeking partial specific performance where the seller did not own all of the property included in the contract. Green v. Gustafson, 482 N.W.2d 842, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>
        A contract to make an oil and gas lease, which may be terminated at the will of the lessee, is specifically enforceable if the contract contains important mutually enforceable provisions such as the payment of a substantial sum as consideration for making the lease and rental for the first rental period which are in themselves enforceable regardless of the surrender of the lease. Alfson v. Anderson, 78 N.W.2d 693, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1956).

       <p>
        While this section supports buyerâs right to specific performance of contract for sale of real property on the ground that monetary damages are presumed to be inadequate, no similar statutory presumption exists to support an action for specific performance by the seller of real property; therefore, sellers were not entitled to specific performance of contract for sale of real property where they failed to meet their burden of proving that the legal remedy for breach of the contract was inadequate. Wolf v. Anderson, 334 N.W.2d 212, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 283</cite> (N.D. 1983).

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c32-04s32-04-13ol11">
       If the party has not received an adequate consideration for the contract.

      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-04s32-04-13ol13">
       If such partyâs assent was obtained by misrepresentation, concealment, circumvention, or unfair practice of any party to whom performance would become due under the contract, or by any promise of such party which has not been substantially fulfilled.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-04s32-04-13ol14">
       If the partyâs assent was given under the influence of mistake, misapprehension, or surprise, except that when the contract provides for compensation in case of mistake, a mistake within the scope of such provision may be compensated for and the contract specifically enforced in other respects, if proper to be so enforced.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The granting of specific performance rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and the supreme court will not interfere with that discretion unless shown it was abused. Harrington v. Harrington, 365 N.W.2d 552, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although it had not cited N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-04-13 in granting the brother specific performance, the district court had discussed the case law in analyzing the undisputed facts in the instant case. Molbert v. Kornkven, 2018 ND 120, 910 N.W.2d 888, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Specific performance will not be enforced unless the contract is just and reasonable and made for an adequate consideration. Carey v. Campbell, 45 N.D. 273, 177 N.W. 372, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Specific performance of an alleged option contract for the sale of land should have been denied where there was no consideration for the contract. Streeter v. Archer, 46 N.D. 251, 176 N.W. 826, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inadequacy of consideration to warrant a denial of specific performance of a contract must be determined upon a consideration of all the circumstances of the case and it must appear that the transaction is not fair and reasonable. Arhart v. Thompson, 75 N.D. 569, 31 N.W.2d 56, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere inadequacy of consideration does not justify a denial of specific performance in the absence of unfairness or overreaching. Harrington v. Harrington, 365 N.W.2d 552, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, specific performance will be denied only when the inadequacy of consideration is such as to demonstrate some gross imposition, undue influence, or shocks the conscience. Harrington v. Harrington, 365 N.W.2d 552, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Because credible testimony supported the familyâs position that the buyers misrepresented the disputed contract to the family as a right of first refusal, the buyers were not entitled to specific performance under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-04-13 due to their misrepresentations.

        In a case in which a purchaser sued sellers for reformation of a warranty deed under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-04-17, the trial court did not err in granting the sellers summary judgment on the purchaserâs claim for reformation based upon mistake; the written deed conformed to the sellersâ
   version of the facts and did not support a claim that both parties intended to say something different from what was said in the deed.

        District court properly focused on the decedentâs intent when he executed the quitclaim deed rather than the intent of the parties to the contract for deed, and because the decedent did not include a reservation of mineral interests in the deed, the law required the district court to presume that was his intention; the son did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that a mutual mistake caused the decedent to execute the deed without the reservation of mineral interests.

        Where a mistake of law results in the partiesâ obvious failure to articulate their true and discoverable intent, reformation is available if justice and common sense require it; however, not all mistakes of law will justify reformation of a contract as ignorance of law must be distinguished, from misapprehension of law with which both parties are familiar.

        Dismissal of a grantorâs complaint seeking reformation of a deed was appropriate because a reservation in the deed expressly providing the grantor with the right to hunt on any or all the premises was a severance of hunting rights from the surface rights that was prohibited by statute. Furthermore, the complaint clearly alleged a mistake of law in the context of ignorance of the law, not a misapprehension of the law, for which the remedy of reformation was not available as a matter of law.

       <p>
        Summary judgment was not appropriate on the grantorsâ
   claim for reformation of a deed as there was parol evidence supporting the inference that a mistake was made; the deed was signed when the flowage easement had not yet been recorded, a mistake the grantee knew about, and there was also evidence that the grantee had told his real estate agent not to say anything about the flowage easement during the closing.

        While fraud is a ground for reformation of written instruments, fraud perpetrated to induce a party to enter into the agreement itself is not a ground for its reformation, but is a ground for its rescission. Striegel v. Dakota Hills, 365 N.W.2d 491, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        A ten-acre shortfall in a deed was a disadvantage to defendant, not an advantage; therefore, it was not the kind of mistake which warranted reformation for plaintiff, the grantor, as âa party aggrieved.â Mau v.

       <p>
        Where party affirmed contract and continued to rely on some of its provisions, his counterclaim for fraud was properly dismissed by summary judgment, because fraud perpetrated to induce a party to enter into the agreement is not a ground for its reformation, but is a ground for rescission, and the party did not seek rescission.

        District court properly reformed the mineral deed naming only one brother as the grantee where it credited the non-named brother's testimony that a mutual mistake was made, and the deed's reference to joint tenants when only one grantee was named was an obvious error that put the purchasers on inquiry under N.D.C.C.

        The specific relief of rescission of a written contract may be adjudged if the consent of the party rescinding was obtained through fraud, provided that he acts promptly upon discovering the facts which entitle him to rescind, if he is free from duress, menace, undue influence, or disability and is aware of his right to rescind.

        A rescission action under N.D.C.C. Â§Â§ 32-04-21 through 32-04-23 is a suit in equity, for which a trial by jury is not available. Therefore, an action by house purchaser seeking to cancel the contract based on the sellerâs fraudulent misrepresentations as to the houseâs structural integrity and water problems was equitable in nature and trial judge did not err in denying plaintiffâs motion for a jury trial.

      When a written instrument, or the record thereof, may cause injury to a person against whom such instrument is void or voidable, such instrument, in an action brought by the party injured, may be adjudged void and the same ordered to be delivered up for cancellation and the record thereof canceled, whether or not extrinsic evidence is necessary to show its invalidity.

        A complaint to remove a cloud from plaintiffâs title and cancel a fraudulent deed should describe the deed in such a manner that it can be identified for cancellation by the officer of the court. Nation v. Cameron, 11 N.W. 525, 2 Dakota 347, 1880 Dakota LEXIS 11 (Dakota 1880).

        An instrument is not a cloud upon a title if its invalidity appears on its face. Morris v. McKnight, 1 N.D. 266, 47 N.W. 375, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 34</cite> (N.D. 1890).

       <p>
        A denial of specific performance means the contract will not be enforced in equity, but cancellation or rescission of the contract simultaneously with denial of specific performance means that it will not be enforced in equity or in law; the standard for granting cancellation is more strict than that for denying specific performance. Sand v. Red River Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 224 N.W.2d 375, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 1974).

       <p>
        Because defendant's complaint in tribal court was not one affecting the title to real property, as it sought only a money judgment, and a lis pendens for that action was not entitled to be recorded, the court concluded that the improperly recorded lis pendens was subject to cancellation under this section, and therefore the district court erred by dismissing plaintiff's application to cancel the lis pendens.

        When the acts sought to be enjoined interfere with legal rights, the courtâs power to issue an injunction is not destroyed because the acts are punishable as a crime. In such a case, the equitable powers of the court are not put forth to enjoin the commission of a crime, although that may incidentally result; they are put forth to protect legal rights against invasion by acts which, if committed, would cause injury for which the ordinary remedies at law would not afford adequate relief.

        In challenging a cityâs decision to reject his petition for rezoning and annexation of his property, property owner argued that the city should have given greater credence to its comprehensive development plan and that the city gave too much credence to the complaints and concerns of area residents in reaching its decision; however, all of these factors went to the wisdom, propriety, and correctness of the decision, rather than compliance with the statutory procedures for annexation, and could not be challenged by seeking declaratory or injunctive relief.

        Trial court incorrectly concluded that injunction was an inappropriate form of relief, since a writ of injunction under this chapter is the correlative of the writ of mandamus under N.D.C.C. Ch. 32-34, and public officers can be compelled to comply with the law through mandamus, or mandatory injunction proceedings, the effect of the two procedures being essentially the same; therefore, a prison inmateâs right to compel prison authorities to provide him with free eyeglasses was dismissed prematurely where the performance of such an act could not be decided on the pleadings alone.

       <p>
        In determining whether the trial courtâs preliminary injunction constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint, it is necessary to determine whether the communication constituted commercial or noncommercial speech and then to determine whether the trial court afforded appropriate safeguards in imposing the preliminary injunction commensurate with the type of speech involved. Fargo Women's Health Org. v. Larson, 381 N.W.2d 176, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 234</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1108, 106 S. Ct. 1957, 90 L. Ed. 2d 365, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 2996 (U.S. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Advertisements of services of pro-life medical clinic held not fully protected speech, so that question of unconstitutional prior restraint of preliminary injunction prescribing false and misleading advertisements would be judged under a relaxed standard of scrutiny appropriate to commercial speech. Fargo Women's Health Org. v. Larson, 381 N.W.2d 176, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 234</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1108, 106 S. Ct. 1957, 90 L. Ed. 2d 365, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 2996 (U.S. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any system of prior restraint on speech bears a heavy presumption against its constitutionality validity. However, commercial speech does not receive the full panoply of protection under the First Amendment as do other forms of protected speech. Fargo Women's Health Org. v. Larson, 381 N.W.2d 176, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 234</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1108, 106 S. Ct. 1957, 90 L. Ed. 2d 365, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 2996 (U.S. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the extent to which the prior restraint doctrine applies to commercial speech has not been fully delineated, it is quite clear that prior restraint on commercial speech is allowed to an extent which would not be allowed toward other forms of protected speech. Fargo Women's Health Org. v. Larson, 381 N.W.2d 176, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 234</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1108, 106 S. Ct. 1957, 90 L.

        The following factors are appropriate in determining whether injunctive relief should be granted: (1) substantial probability of succeeding on the merits; (2) irreparable injury; (3) harm to other interested parties; (4) effect on the public interest. (See Dataphase Systems v. C. L. Systems, 640 F.2d 109 (8th Cir. 1981) for a summary of these factors which is consistent with North Dakota law.) F-M Asphalt v.

       <p>
        Nothing in record indicated that money damages would have been inadequate, that defendants would have been unable to satisfy money judgment in event that plaintiffs prevailed on merits, or that bank was in any danger as financial institution. Absence of any such evidence indicated that plaintiffsâ injuries, if any, could be adequately compensated by an award of damages and that plaintiffs were not likely to suffer irreparable harm before decision on merits could be rendered.

      The injunction may be granted at the time of commencing the action, or at any time afterwards before judgment, upon its appearing satisfactorily to the court or judge, by the affidavit of the plaintiff, or of any other person, that sufficient grounds exist therefor. A copy of the affidavit must be served with the injunction. In no case shall a longer period than six months elapse before the hearing of the merits of the case shall be had for the purpose of deciding the question as to the justice or necessity of making the temporary restraining order permanent.

        This section vests in the trial court the discretion to determine in the first instance whether a temporary injunction shall be granted upon the giving of the proper security; but that discretion should be exercised in the light of the rule that the purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the status quo and protect the rights of the plaintiff pending a determination of the merits.

        Trial court erred in dismissing criminal charges under N.D.C.C. Â§ 12.1-10-05 against defendants accused of violating temporary injunction, who had not exercised their right to demand a hearing be held within six months of the time the temporary injunction was issued or to seek dissolution of the injunction after six months under this section, because the injunction remained valid and their attempt to dissolve the injunction after alleged violation came too late.

      When no provision is made by statute as to security upon an injunction, the court or judge shall require a written undertaking on the part of the plaintiff, with or without sureties, to the effect that the plaintiff will pay to the party enjoined such damages, not exceeding an amount to be specified, as the party may sustain by reason of the injunction, if the court shall finally decide that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto.

        In proceedings to enjoin increased utility rates, it was not an abuse of discretion for trial court to require defendants to furnish adequate bonds conditioned for the repayment of surcharges collected under the purported orders of the public service commission.

        A trial court, upon dissolution of injunction, has discretionary power to assess damages, to order the damages to be ascertained by reference or in such other manner as the court may direct, or leave the injunction defendant to his remedy by an action at law.

       <p>
        In an action of claim and delivery, a party recovering property wrongfully detained from his possession may recover as damages the value of its use during the period of detention where it has a usable value and is not held for sale or consumption. Tooz v. Tooz, 76 N.D. 732, 39 N.W.2d 257, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1949).

        Defendantsâ claim they were entitled to jury trial because plaintiffâs action was a legal action for possession of specific property, and not an equitable action for foreclosure, could not be raised following trial courtâs decision to the contrary prior to defendantsâ first appeal, because the law-of-the-case doctrine encompassed issues decided by the trial court which were not presented for review in prior appeal. Sargent County Bank v. Wentworth, 547 N.W.2d 753, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. 1996).

     <p>
      Upon the receipt of an affidavit and requisition as provided in section 32-07-03 with a written undertaking executed by one or more sufficient sureties approved by the sheriff, to the effect that they are bound in double the value of the property, as stated in such affidavit, for the prosecution of the action for the return of the property to the defendant, if return thereof is adjudged, and for the payment to the defendant of such sum as for any cause may be recovered against the plaintiff, the sheriff forthwith shall take the property described in the affidavit, if it is in the possession of the defendant or the defendantâs agent, and shall retain it in the sheriffâs custody. The sheriff also without delay shall serve on the defendant a copy of the affidavit, requisition, and undertaking by delivering the same to the defendant personally, if the defendant can be found, or to the defendantâs agent from whose possession the property is taken, or if neither can be found, by leaving them at the usual place of abode of either with some person of suitable age and discretion.

    Exceptions by defendant to sufficiency of sureties or amount of undertaking.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The defendant, within three days after the service of a copy of the affidavit, requisition, and undertaking, may give notice to the sheriff that the defendant excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties, or the amount of the undertaking. If the defendant fails to do so, the defendant shall be deemed to have waived all objection to them. When the defendant excepts to the sufficiency of the sureties, the sureties shall justify as provided in chapter 32-02, and the sheriff shall be responsible for the sufficiency of the sureties until the objection to them is either waived as above provided, or until they shall justify or new sureties shall be substituted and shall justify. If the defendant excepts to the sureties, or to the amount of the undertaking, the defendant cannot reclaim the property as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t32c32-07s32-07-06" target="_self">32-07-06</a></cite>. When the defendant excepts to the amount of the undertaking, the sheriff shall retain possession of the property for five days after the service of notice of such exception upon the sheriff. In such case the defendant, upon two daysâ notice to the plaintiff, may apply to the judge of the court in which the action is pending for an order requiring the plaintiff to execute an undertaking in such action in a larger amount than that of the undertaking which has been served. The affidavits upon which the defendant bases the defendantâs application shall be served with the notice. If the application is denied, the order of the court shall direct the sheriff forthwith to deliver the property to the plaintiff. If the application is granted, the order of the court shall direct the sheriff to deliver the property to the defendant unless the plaintiff within a time of not more than four days, to be fixed by the court, shall execute a bond in such sum as the court shall prescribe, with sureties to be approved by the sheriff.

        A redelivery undertaking is not only a substitute for the possession of the property by the plaintiff, but is security for any money judgment recovered. Larson v. Hanson, 26 N.D. 406, 144 N.W. 681, 1913 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1913).

        This chapter, as it read prior to the 1991 amendments, was held unconstitutional, as it denied due process to debtors. Garrison Mem. Hosp. v. Rayer, 453 N.W.2d 787 (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although under this chapter, as it read prior to amendment in 1991, a defendant could seek a hearing after an ex parte prejudgment writ of attachment had been issued, there was no statute entitling a defendant to an immediate or prompt full hearing after issuance of the writ at which the plaintiff was required to prove an underlying debt or its amount or even probable cause; therefore, this chapter did not pass constitutional muster. Garrison Mem. Hosp. v. Rayer, 453 N.W.2d 787 (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        This chapter, as it read prior to amendment in 1991, denied defendant due process of law since, inter alia, N.D.C.C. Â§Â§ 32-08.1-02, 32-08.1-03, 32-08.1-05 did not require the plaintiff to show the nature and amount of the claim or demonstrate probable cause to a judge exercising discretion whenever necessary to minimize the likelihood of improvident issuance of a writ. Nor did the statutes require the plaintiff to show any reason why a summary issuance of a writ of attachment was necessary to avoid removal, destruction, or concealment of the property or loss of the plaintiffâs proprietary interests or that there were any other extraordinary situations requiring special protection to a state or creditor interest. The judgeâs only duty with respect to the issuance of a writ was to sign it. Only after a writ had been issued was a judge afforded any opportunity for the exercise of judicial discretion, for such things as adjusting the amount of the plaintiffâs bond or vacating or modifying the writ. Garrison Mem. Hosp. v. Rayer, 453 N.W.2d 787 (N.D. 1990).

        Former chapter 32-08 did not achieve the constitutional accommodation of the debtorâs and creditorâs conflicting interests required by the U. S. Supreme Court; because of that lack of constitutional accommodation, seizure of debtorâs mobile home was a denial of due process; former chapter 32-08 failed in that: 1) it was not necessary to allege summary attachment was needed to prevent removal, destruction or concealment of property or loss of creditorâs proprietary interests therein; 2) there was not adequate judicial supervision in that warrant could be issued by clerk alone without action by judge; 3) debtor seeking discharge of warrant had to post bond; 4) impact upon debtors in this particular case in physically seizing and removing their sole residence outweighed stateâs interest in providing ex parte preliminary relief for creditors.

        Compliance with Statute.

       The remedy by attachment is purely statutory, is harsh and arbitrary, condemns without hearing, and can be used only upon substantial compliance with every requirement of the statute. Birchall v. Griggs, 4 N.D. 305, 60 N.W. 842, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1894).

        Sufficiency of Affidavit.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The affidavit of attachment requires no greater particularity of statement than is required in a pleading. Gans v. Beasley, 4 N.D. 140, 59 N.W. 714 (1894), distinguished, Baird v. Holie, 61 N.D. 280, 237 N.W. 786, 790 (1931), explained, Goldstein v. Peter Fox Sons Co., 22 N.D. 636, 135 N.W. 180, 40 L.R.A. (n.s.) 566 (1912), decided prior to the adoption of N.D.R.Civ.P. 12.
      </p>
      <p>
       An affidavit must be stated in positive and not alternative language. Birchall v. Griggs, 4 N.D. 305, 60 N.W. 842, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1894).
      </p>
      <p>
       An affidavit for attachment need not state that the defendant has property, real or personal, in the state subject to levy. Hemmi v. Grover, 18 N.D. 578, 120 N.W. 561, 1909 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 19</cite> (N.D. 1909); Moen v. Melin, 57 N.D. 630, 223 N.W. 702, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 306</cite> (N.D. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exact language of the statute need not be used in an affidavit for attachment, but the facts must be stated so that a conclusion in the language of the statute would necessarily be drawn. Weil v. Quam, 21 N.D. 344, 131 N.W. 244, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1911).

      <p>
       A complaint under the Declaratory Judgment Act to obtain a declaration of the rights of the plaintiffs and defendant under a written contract for the sale of land did not set forth a proper cause of action for attachment, since it was not an action to recover money.

       The following cases were decided under former chapter 32-08.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Amount of Undertaking.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest to accrue in the future should not be considered in determining the amount of the undertaking for attachment. Hemmi v. Grover, 18 N.D. 578, 120 N.W. 561, 1909 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 19</cite> (N.D. 1909).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Failure to Give Undertakings.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If the clerk issues a warrant of attachment without an undertaking purporting upon its face to be executed by a surety, the attachment is âirregularly issuedâ and defendant may move to discharge same. Golden Valley County v. Curtin, 52 N.D. 372, 203 N.W. 189, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Liability of Sureties.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action for damages on an undertaking in attachment, the liability of the sureties is strictly construed. Thompson v. Webber, 29 N.W. 671, 4 Dakota 240, 1886 Dakota LEXIS 14 (Dakota 1886).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where undertaking for attachment furnished by the plaintiff was for a sufficient amount at the time it was furnished, and an amendment to the complaint in no manner changed the cause of action but merely increased the ad damnum, the sureties upon the attachment bond were not released from liability and the subsequent claim of the larger damages did not invalidate the attachment. MacDonald v. Fitzgerald, 42 N.D. 133, 171 N.W. 879, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although surety is ordinarily liable only in event principal has been found liable, rule does not apply to surety under attachment laws; attachment surety became liable on undertaking when attachment was declared void, and attachment defendant could bring action against surety without first obtaining judgment against attachment plaintiff. Renner v. J. Gruman Steel Co., 147 N.W.2d 663, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Promise to Pay Damages and Costs.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere promise of the plaintiff to pay all damages and costs, in the event of a defeat, was not an undertaking under the statute where it was not executed by a surety. Golden Valley County v. Curtin, 52 N.D. 372, 203 N.W. 189, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Sufficiency.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This statute clearly contemplates an undertaking with a surety, the sufficiency of which, however, the defendant may challenge. Golden Valley County v. Curtin, 52 N.D. 372, 203 N.W. 189, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1925).

The surety shall justify as provided in section 32-08.1-05, but if there are more than one surety they may be accepted if they are jointly responsible for the required sum.

       The following cases were decided under former chapter 32-08.

       <b>
        Destruction of Writ.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An undertaking for discharge not only releases the levy but destroys the writ. Fox v. Mackenzie, 1 N.D. 298, 47 N.W. 386, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1890).

      <p>
       <b>
        Discharge Bond.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The giving of an undertaking to procure a discharge of an attachment does not merely release the levy but destroys the writ itself, and, thereafter, a motion to dissolve the attachment as being irregularly or improvidently issued will not be entertained. Fox v. Mackenzie, 1 N.D. 298, 47 N.W. 386, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1890).
      </p>
      <p>
       The law authorizing a sheriff, in executing a warrant of attachment, to demand indemnity does not apply to an action to recover on a discharge bond. Ravely v. Isensee, 57 N.D. 286, 221 N.W. 38, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 1928).

       <b>
        Growing Crop.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing in the office of the register of deeds [now recorder] of notice of abandonment of a levy of attachment on a growing crop does not relieve the attaching creditor from damages subsequently accruing to the crop, where no actual notice was given to the owner. Kelly v. Stockgrowers Credit Corp., 66 N.D. 209, 263 N.W. 717, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1935).

       <b>
        Recovery on Discharge Bond.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The law authorizing a sheriff, in executing a warrant of attachment, to demand indemnity does not apply to an action to recover on a discharge bond. Ravely v. Isensee, 57 N.D. 286, 221 N.W. 38, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 1928).

      <p>
       <b>
        Stay of Proceedings.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An undertaking for discharge of an attachment operates as a stay without any order or direction of the trial court or judge. National Bank v. Hanberg, 10 N.D. 383, 87 N.W. 1006, 1901 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 55</cite> (N.D. 1901).

       <b>
        Substitute Bond.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A bond given before the appearance of the defendant in an action to foreclose a lien on property to secure the release thereof, after seizure, is a substitute bond and not a discharge bond. Minneapolis Threshing Mach. Co. v. Warner, 52 N.D. 432, 203 N.W. 197, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1925).

        Although former N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-08-24 was construed in Page v. Steinke, 60 N.D. 685, 236 N.W. 261 (1931) to place on creditor the burden of showing that grounds for attachment warrant actually existed and thus would appear to be similar in scope to Louisiana statute upheld by U. S. Supreme Court, fact that North Dakota statutes required debtor to file bond to obtain a post-seizure discharge hearing was a significant distinction and was one of several reasons cited for holding that former chapter 32-08 did not achieve the requisite constitutional accommodation of the conflicting interests of the debtor and creditor. Guzman v. Western State Bank, 516 F.2d 125, 1975 U.S. App. LEXIS 15713 (8th Cir. N.D. 1975).

         Dissolution of Attachment.

        The giving of an undertaking to procure a discharge of an attachment does not merely release the levy but destroys the writ itself, and, thereafter, a motion to dissolve the attachment as being irregularly or improvidently issued will not be entertained. Fox v. Mackenzie, 1 N.D. 298, 47 N.W. 386, 1890 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant cannot move for dissolution of an attachment on the sole ground of his nonownership of the attached property. Gilmore v. Olson, 54 N.D. 633, 210 N.W. 341, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        The dissolution of an attachment may be sought for the reason that the ground of attachment alleged in the affidavit does not exist and did not exist when the affidavit was made. Page v. Steinke, 60 N.D. 685, 236 N.W. 261, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite> (N.D. 1931).

       <p>
        The filing in the office of the register of deeds [now recorder] of notice of abandonment of a levy of attachment on a growing crop does not relieve the attaching creditor from damages subsequently accruing to the crop, where no actual notice was given to the owner. Kelly v. Stockgrowers Credit Corp., 66 N.D. 209, 263 N.W. 717, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1935).

       </p>
       <p>
        If a clerk issues the warrant without an undertaking, purporting upon its face to be executed by a surety, the attachment is âirregularly issuedâ and it is, therefore, proper for defendant to move to discharge the same. Golden Valley County v. Curtin, 52 N.D. 372, 203 N.W. 189, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1925).

      In making its determination of the issue raised by the special answer, the court shall consider any undue hardship on the defendant that would result from an issuance of the warrant. If the court finds for the defendant, the judge presiding shall tax the defendantâs costs of such trial and an order shall be entered dismissing the writ or that the property attached be delivered to the defendant. The jury or the court shall, on the trial of the action or thereafter, assess the damages sustained by the defendant by reason of the taking and detention or sale of the property attached or by reason of any injury thereto. The same, together with the costs so taxed, shall be a setoff to the plaintiffâs demand, and if in excess of it, or the plaintiff fails to recover, the defendant shall have judgment for the amount due. If the court on the trial of such special issue finds for the plaintiff, the presiding judge shall tax the plaintiffâs costs of such trial, and the amount so taxed shall, if the plaintiff recovers, be taxed by the clerk as disbursement in the action. If the defendant or the defendantâs assignee recovers judgment in the action, said costs and the judgment shall be offset.

Any person who shall willfully conceal or withhold such property from the sheriff shall be liable to double damages at the suit of the party injured.

       The following cases were decided under former chapter 32-08.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Compliance with Statute.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A lien of an attachment is ineffectual until the levy is made in compliance with the statute. Mott v. Holbrook, 28 N.D. 251, 148 N.W. 1061 (1914), distinguished, Sox v. Miracle, 35 N.D. 458, 160 N.W. 716 (1916), Crosson v. Kartowitz, 43 N.D. 466, 175 N.W. 868, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1919) and Dickinson v. First Nat'l Bank, 64 N.D. 273, 252 N.W. 54, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 274</cite> (N.D. 1933); Zimmerman v. Boynton, 59 N.D. 112, 229 N.W. 3, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       An attachment proceeding to establish a lien to aid in the collection of a debt is purely statutory, and the statute must be strictly complied with. Dickinson v. First Nat'l Bank, 64 N.D. 273, 252 N.W. 54, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 274</cite> (N.D. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Conditional Jurisdiction.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The levy of a warrant of attachment gives the court a conditional jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action. Goldstein v. Peter Fox Sons Co., 22 N.D. 636, 135 N.W. 180, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 1912).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Growing Crop.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a notice of levy in the office of the register of deeds [now recorder] of the county where the crop is situated, and service on the person having custody of the crop is sufficient levy of attachment on a growing crop. Kelly v. Stockgrowers Credit Corp., 66 N.D. 209, 263 N.W. 717, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Neglect of Official Duty.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of an officer to deliver a copy of the execution to the person from whom personal property is taken renders the levy void. Langer v. Nultemeier, 55 N.D. 132, 212 N.W. 817, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 44</cite> (N.D. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure of a sheriff to file the required inventory and return within twenty days after the seizure of attached property renders the attachment void. Summerfield v. Paulson, 68 N.D. 161, 278 N.W. 248, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1938).

       <b>
        Notice of Levy.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Service on defendant of a notice of levy of an execution on land is not necessary. Finch, Van Slyck &amp; McConville v. Jackson, 57 N.D. 17, 220 N.W. 130, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite>, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1928).

      <p>
       <b>
        Personal Property Incapable of Manual Delivery.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A levy on personal property incapable of manual delivery must be made under a warrant of attachment in strict compliance with the statute. Ireland v. Adair, 12 N.D. 29, 94 N.W. 766, 1903 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1903).

       <b>
        Personal Property in Safety Deposit Box.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment debtorâs personal property in a safety deposit box leased by him from a bank is subject to levy on execution, whether it is considered to be in possession of such debtor as a lessee or in possession of the bank as bailee. O'Connor v. McManus, 71 N.D. 88, 299 N.W. 22, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1941).

      <p>
       <b>
        Real Property.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The interest of a vendee under an executory contract for the purchase of school land from the state of North Dakota is subject to levy as real property. Sox v. Miracle, 35 N.D. 458, 160 N.W. 716, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 1916).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where judgment was docketed in the district court and became a lien upon the property of the judgment debtors, including the property covered by the mortgage sought to be foreclosed in that action, notice of levy to be filed and recorded in the office of the register of deeds [now recorder] was not required in order to make a valid levy. Winslow v. Klundt, 51 N.D. 808, 201 N.W. 169, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1924).
      </p>
      <p>
       A sheriffâs failure to file with the register of deeds [now recorder] a notice of attachment stating the amount of plaintiffâs claim renders the attachment void. Zimmerman v. Boynton, 59 N.D. 112, 229 N.W. 3, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the courtâs jurisdiction depends on a valid attachment of a nonresidentâs realty, and other portions of the record show the levy void, the import of verity from recitals is destroyed, and the judgment is void. Zimmerman v. Boynton, 59 N.D. 112, 229 N.W. 3, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 1930).

      The actions herein authorized to be brought by the sheriff or officer may be prosecuted by the plaintiff or under the plaintiffâs direction, upon the delivery by the plaintiff to the sheriff or officer of an undertaking, with two sufficient sureties, to the effect that the plaintiff will indemnify the sheriff or officer for all damages, costs, and expenses thereon not exceeding five hundred dollars in any one action. Such sureties shall, when required by the sheriff or officer, justify by making an affidavit that each is worth double the amount of the penalty named in the undertaking over and above all debts and exemptions.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The statute applies to a case where the property of a third person is levied upon while in possession of the attachment debtor under such circumstances as to raise a presumption that it is owned by him. Probstfield v. Hunt, 17 N.D. 572, 118 N.W. 226, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1908).

         Burden of Proof.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where both the title and possession of the property levied upon are in dispute, the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to establish the title and right of possession at the time of the levy. Wipperman Mercantile Co. v. Robbins, 23 N.D. 208, 135 N.W. 785, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 1912).

       </p>
       <p>
        The filing in the office of the register of deeds [now recorder] of notice of abandonment of a levy of attachment on a growing crop does not relieve the attaching creditor from damages subsequently accruing to the crop where no actual notice was given to the owner. Kelly v. Stockgrowers Credit Corp., 66 N.D. 209, 263 N.W. 717, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1935).

         Indemnity from Attaching Creditor.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A sheriff executing a warrant of attachment in case of an adverse claim may demand indemnity from the attaching creditor. Ravely v. Isensee, 57 N.D. 286, 221 N.W. 38, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The sheriff may require an indemnifying undertaking from a levying creditor where a third-party claim is asserted, and may release the levy if the undertaking is not furnished. Kelly v. Baird, 64 N.D. 346, 252 N.W. 70, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 205</cite> (N.D. 1934).

       </p>
       <p>
        The giving of the notice prescribed by the statute is not necessary where a sheriff attaches and sells property in the possession of and owned by a third person not named in the writ. Aber v. Twichell, 17 N.D. 229, 116 N.W. 95, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 48</cite> (N.D. 1908).

         Sufficiency of Third-Party Claim.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A third-party claim under the provisions of this section sufficiently alleges ownership if it states that at all times, including the time of seizure, the property was and still is the property of the claimants, that the ground of their right and title to the possession of the property is that they purchased the same with their own money and paid therefor, without stating from whom the property was acquired or the consideration paid.

       Under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-09.1-01(3), a clientâs payments to an attorneyâs professional corporation is not compensation paid or payable for personal services. Because fees paid or payable to a professional law corporation are not earnings under the statute, as a matter of law a 10-day notice is not required under N.D.C.C.

     <p>
      Any creditor is entitled to proceed by garnishment in any court having jurisdiction of the subject of the action against any person, any public corporation, the United States, the state of North Dakota, or any institution, department, or agency of the state, indebted to or having any property in possession or under control, belonging to the creditorâs debtor after securing a judgment against the debtor in a court of competent jurisdiction, in the cases, upon the conditions, and in the manner prescribed in this chapter. A garnishment action brought pursuant to this chapter is the exclusive procedure which may be used to execute on earnings of a debtor while those earnings are held by a third-party employer.

        Title to Property or Indebtedness.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a garnishment action, plaintiffâs right to recover against the garnishee is predicated entirely upon defendantâs right to recover in his own name, and for his own use, against the garnishee. Unless the defendant can so recover, neither can the plaintiff. Shortridge v. Sturdivant, 32 N.D. 154, 155 N.W. 20, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 1915).
      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiff in a garnishment action can obtain no greater or better title to the property or indebtedness garnished than that possessed by the defendant in the main action. Hatcher v. Plumley, 38 N.D. 147, 164 N.W. 698, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 24</cite> (N.D. 1917).

     <p>
      Subject to the provisions of sections 32-09.1-12 and 32-09.1-13, the disclosure is conclusive as to all property of the defendant. If the garnishee denies having any indebtedness to the defendant or having any property of the defendant in possession, the filing in court of a copy of the disclosure operates as a full discharge of the garnishee at the end of twenty days from the date of service of the disclosure, in the absence of further proceedings as provided for in sections 32-09.1-12 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t32c32-09.1s32-09.1-13" target="_self">32-09.1-13</a></cite>. The filing of objections to the disclosure or the filing of any motion or other proceedings operates as a stay of the discharge. The court may, upon proper showing, relieve the plaintiff from the operation of the discharge after the expiration of twenty days. The garnishee may be discharged where the value of the property of the defendant held or indebtedness owing to the defendant is less than ten dollars, and the garnishee may apply to the court to be discharged as to any property or indebtedness in excess of the amount which may be required to satisfy the plaintiffâs judgment.

      Either before or after written disclosure, any party to the garnishment proceedings may obtain an ex parte order requiring oral disclosure. The order may be obtained upon affidavit showing, upon information and belief, facts justifying the order, and the court shall require the garnishee to appear for oral examination before the court. If the garnishee holds the garnished property by a title that is void as to the defendantâs creditors, the garnishee may be charged for the property although the defendant could not have maintained an action against the garnishee for it; but in this, and in all other cases in which the garnishee denies liability, the plaintiff may move the court at any time before the garnishee is discharged, on notice to both the defendant and the garnishee, for leave to file a supplemental complaint making the garnishee a party to the action, and setting forth the facts upon which the plaintiff claims to charge the garnishee. If probable cause is shown, the motion shall be granted. The supplemental complaint must be served upon both defendant and garnishee, either or both of whom may answer, and the plaintiff may reply. The issues must be brought to trial and tried as in other actions.

Â§ 32-09.1-12 against a manufacturerâs commercial general liability insurer where inventorsâ alleged damages stemmed from the insured manufacturerâs failure to properly assemble the entire funnel and thus, the insurerâs commercial general liability policyâs product and work exclusions precluded coverage for the alleged damage to the brass inserts and various other parts and equipment that the inventors provided to the manufacturer in the manufacturing process; for purposes of the policy exclusion, product and work included all of the various parts and assembly of the funnel.

        The trial court did not abuse its discretion by finding both lack of gross neglect and good cause to vacate a wifeâs default judgment, where the wife filed a garnishment summons and disclosure on a company which she believed owed her husband money to collect a divorce judgment. Although the companyâs failure to return the disclosure form did not comply with N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-09.1-09, the disclosure form itself described how it could dispute any indebtedness to the husband, and the company was no stranger to legal procedures and should have known a response was required, the trial court determined that itâs nondisclosure was the result of an honest mistake, not gross neglect or recklessness.

When a person is charged as garnishee by reason of any property in possession other than an indebtedness payable in money, that person shall deliver the property, or so much of the property as may be necessary, to the officer holding execution, and the property must be sold and the proceeds accounted for in the same manner as if the property had been taken on execution against the defendant. The garnishee may not be compelled to deliver any specific articles at any time or place other than as stipulated in the contract with the defendant.

      A garnishee summons lapses and the garnishee is discharged of any liability upon the expiration of three hundred sixty days after the service of the summons, or a longer period of time either agreed to in writing by the plaintiff and the defendant or ordered by the court. Immediately upon the lapse of the garnishee summons, all earnings, money, property, and effects that the garnishee has been retaining pursuant to the garnishment must be returned to the defendant if the defendant is otherwise legally entitled to receipt of them.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A plaintiff may obtain a two hundred seventy-day continuing lien on wages by garnishment. A plaintiff obtaining a continuing lien on wages by garnishment shall mark âcontinuing lienâ on the caption of the garnishee summons. Each garnishment disclosure form must provide the garnishee will continue to hold the nonexempt portion of the defendantâs earnings as the earnings accrue through the last payroll period ending on or before two hundred seventy days from the effective date of the garnishee summons, or until the sum held equals the amount stated in the garnishee summons, or until the employment relationship terminates, whichever first occurs.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the garnisheeâs answers to a garnishment disclosure form provide the amount withheld is less than ten dollars, the garnishee is not required to return subsequent forms to the plaintiff until the amount withheld is ten dollars or more. For any pay period in which the garnishee is not required under this section to return the form to the plaintiff, the garnisheeâs answers from the previous form remain in effect. At the expected termination of the lien, the plaintiff shall mail the garnishee an additional copy of the garnishment disclosure form upon which the garnishee within ten days shall make further disclosure.

        A claim for exemption in garnishment proceedings in justice court, to serve as a defense, must have been preceded by the filing of a schedule of the debtorâs personal property. Burcell v. Goldstein, 23 N.D. 257, 136 N.W. 243, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 1912).

        A debtor who transfers all property not garnished to creditors to pay debts does not waive the right to claim property garnished as exempt. First Nat'l Bank v. Oliver, 55 N.D. 741, 214 N.W. 911, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 1927).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Court monitor, appointed by a trial court to observe and report actions of defendant bank during litigation, was not a âreceiverâ within North Dakota law, because the monitor did not take possession of any fund or property which was subject of litigation. Therefore, statutes applicable to receivers were inapplicable. Vorachek v. Citizens State Bank, 461 N.W.2d 580, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The following functions, assigned by court to a monitor, were not those of a receiver: acting as a conduit during litigation by obtaining monthly reports from defendant bank about salaries, bonuses, expenditures, or loan write-offs in favor of bankâs shareholders, officers, or directors; attending meetings of board of directors; receiving minutes of those meetings; and forwarding all information and reports received from bank to court and to all counsel.

        An application for appointment of a receiver in an action to dissolve a partnership is addressed to the trial courtâs discretion, and its ruling will be disturbed only for abuse thereof.

        A receiver for an alleged insolvent corporation was improperly appointed under this section at the request of a creditor, seeking a money judgment, who had no lien on any property of the corporation or interest in any fund in its possession and showed no interest in any corporate property. Baird v. Agricultural Credit Corp., 64 N.D. 456, 253 N.W. 164, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite> (N.D. 1934).

Gunsch v. Gunsch, 69 N.W.2d 739, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite>, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 1954).

        To entitle a judgment creditor to an order appointing a receiver of his debtorâs property, it must appear that the creditor in good faith has exhausted his remedies at law and, unless special circumstances excuse such course, execution must have been issued and returned unsatisfied.

      No party or person interested in an action can be appointed receiver therein without the written consent of the opposing party filed with the clerk. If a receiver is appointed upon an ex parte application, the court before making the order may require from the applicant an undertaking with sufficient sureties in an amount to be fixed by the court, to the effect that the applicant will pay to the defendant all damages the defendant may sustain by reason of the appointment of such receiver and the entry by the receiver upon the receiverâs duties, in case the applicant shall have procured such appointment wrongfully, maliciously, or without sufficient cause, and the court in its discretion at any time after said appointment may require an additional undertaking.

     <p>
      The state may bring an action to vacate or annul letters patent for lands granted by this state in any of the following cases:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c32-12s32-12-01ol11">
       When they were obtained by means of a fraudulent suggestion or concealment of a material fact made by or with the knowledge or consent of the person to whom they were issued.

      <li id="t32c32-12s32-12-01ol12">
       When they were issued in ignorance of a material fact or through mistake.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-12s32-12-01ol13">
       When the patentee, or those claiming under the patentee, have done or omitted an act in violation of the terms and conditions upon which the letters patent were granted, or by any other means have forfeited the interest acquired under the same.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Whenever the attorney general has good reason to believe that any act or omission specified in this section can be proved and that the person to be made defendant has no sufficient legal defense, the attorney general must commence such an action. Upon the rendition of a judgment vacating or annulling letters patent, the attorney general shall cause a copy of the judgment roll to be filed in the office of the secretary of state.

        Suit challenging the constitutionality of N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12-02, which required a âcost bondâ before suing the State in a contractual dispute, was dismissed because an individual claiming that the State Tax Commissioner denied him a refund for motor vehicle excise taxes lacked standing since he had not suffered an injury in fact where: (1) the Tax Commissioner did not deny the individualâs refund request, but merely requested that he complete and return the proper form; (2) the individual had not commenced an action under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12-02, and thus he was never required to post a bond; and (3) even if he had commenced a state court action, it was uncertain whether there would have been a need for the filing of a surety bond.

Â§Â§ 65-12-03, 65-12-06 and 65-12-11 (see now N.D.C.C. chapter 26.1-22.1), boiler inspectors are required to inspect boilers and issue certificates of inspection and boiler owners are required to pay inspection fees, these rights and obligations do not create a contractual relationship between the inspectors and boiler owners; thus while failure to make a careful inspection may constitute a breach of duty under tort principals, it does not constitute a breach of any contractual promise or obligation. Schloesser v. Larson, 458 N.W.2d 257, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1990), overruled, Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr. Co., 521 N.W.2d 632, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

     <p>
      The state is not liable for a claim arising upon contract which is the result of the failure of any computer hardware or software, telecommunications network, or device containing a computer processor to interpret, produce, calculate, generate, or account for a date that is compatible with the year 2000 date change if the state has made a good-faith effort to make the computer hardware or software, telecommunications network, or device containing a computer processor compliant with the year 2000 date change. For the purposes of this section, the state is presumed to have made a good-faith effort to make the computer hardware or software, telecommunications network, or device containing a computer processor compliant with the year 2000 date change if the results of testing establish that the computer hardware or software, telecommunications network, or device containing a computer processor meets the compliance requirements of this section, or if the state has sought and received an assurance of compliance from the manufacturer or supplier, or if the state has sought an assurance of compliance from the manufacturer, supplier, government, or other reliable source when testing or receiving an assurance from the manufacturer or supplier of the computer hardware or software, telecommunications network, or device containing a computer processor is not practicable. For the purposes of this section, computer hardware or software, a telecommunications network, or device containing a computer processor is compliant with the year 2000 date change if:

        The doctrine of governmental immunity from tort liability is abolished, and governmental bodies, other than state government, are subject to suit for damages by individuals injured by negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of their agents and employees, whether engaged in a proprietary or governmental function. Kitto v. Minot Park Dist., 224 N.W.2d 795, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1974).

        This chapter and its predecessor, were enacted to limit the liability imposed upon political subdivisions by the decision in Kitto v. Minot Park Dist., 224 N.W.2d 795 (N.D. 1974), overruled in part, Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr. Co., 521 N.W.2d 632 (N.D. 1994). O'Fallon v. Pollard, 427 N.W.2d 809, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        Where injuries are sustained by a nonpaying recreational user, N.D.C.C. ch. 53-08 precludes liability against the political subdivision for ordinary acts of negligence by its employees which relate to the condition of the property; unless the political subdivision, through its employees, has committed a willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on the property, the political subdivision is not liable. Fastow v. Burleigh County Water Resource Dist., 415 N.W.2d 505, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 427</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The obvious purpose of this chapter is to limit exposure to potential liability. The reduced three-year period for commencing an action under the chapter furthers this purpose. In effect, the three-year statute of limitations is the legislatively imposed quid pro quo for the liability provided by this chapter. Olson v. University of N. Dakota, 488 N.W.2d 386, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon remand of the case to the trial court, the trial court under the authority of N.D.C.C. Â§ 1-02-39 could consider the factors listed in that statute to determine the appropriate limitations period to be applied to the lesseesâ
   contract claims against the political subdivision. The trial court needed to do so because it applied the wrong limitations period to determine that the contract claims were barred against the political subdivision, especially given the legislatureâs intent under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.1-01 that claims against political subdivisions be treated separately from claims against the state, that tort claims as recognized by the factors set forth in N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.1-02, that state tort liability was separate from political subdivision liability as contemplated under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.2-01, and that the legislature had provided a âcatch-allâ limitations provision for actions against only the state and its employees under N.D.C.C.

       A personal injury, as contemplated by this chapter, includes physical injuries, disease, sickness, mental anguish and suffering; however, in order to recover for mental anguish and suffering, there must be a direct causal connection between the alleged injuries and the acts of the political subdivision which are not discretionary. McCroskey v. Cass County, 303 N.W.2d 330, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon remand of the case to the trial court, the trial court under the authority of N.D.C.C. Â§ 1-02-39 could consider the factors listed in that statute to determine the appropriate limitations period to be applied to the lesseesâ
   contract claims against the political subdivision. The trial court needed to do so because it applied the wrong limitations period to determine that the contract claims were barred against the political subdivision, especially given the legislatureâs intent under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.1-01 that claims against political subdivisions be treated separately from claims against the state, that tort claims as recognized by the factors set forth in N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.1-02, that state tort liability was separate from political subdivision liability as contemplated under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.2-01, and that the legislature had provided a âcatch-allâ limitations provision for actions against only the state and its employees under N.D.C.C.

       Each political subdivision is liable for money damages for injuries when the injuries are proximately caused by the negligence or wrongful act or omission of any employee acting within the scope of the employeeâs employment or office under circumstances in which the employee would be personally liable to a claimant in accordance with the laws of this state, or injury caused from some condition or use of tangible property, real or personal, under circumstances in which the political subdivision, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant. The enactment of a law, rule, regulation, or ordinance to protect any personâs health, safety, property, or welfare does not create a duty of care on the part of the political subdivision, its employees, or its agents, if that duty would not otherwise exist.

       The liability of political subdivisions under this chapter is limited to a total of two hundred fifty thousand dollars per person and one million dollars for any number of claims arising from any single occurrence regardless of the number of political subdivisions, or employees of such political subdivisions, which are involved in that occurrence. A political subdivision may not be held liable, or be ordered to indemnify an employee held liable, for punitive or exemplary damages.

        Where claim against township was based entirely upon the actions of the townshipâs representatives in refusing to grant approval to move a house into the township until all requirements of the township zoning ordinance had been satisfied, the claim was based on a discretionary process performed by the township representatives and the township was immune from liability on such claim irrespective of whether or not the representatives abused their discretion or whether or not the zoning ordinance, or parts of it, were invalid.

        An auditorâs duty to search the file of tax payment receipts for a secondary address of the taxpayer and to mail the notice to that address upon return of an undelivered notice mailed in accordance with this section is not a discretionary act within the meaning of subdivision (3)(c) of this section.

        City police officers were immune from liability for plaintiffsâ state law claims for malicious prosecution and false arrest/false imprisonment, regardless of whether the officers were negligent or whether they exercised due care when they arrested plaintiffs, because officerâs decision to arrest plaintiffs was a discretionary function.

        The discretionary function exception did not apply where the decision whether the plaintiffâs dogs posed a danger to the deputies or to others, which would justify the dogsâ destruction, implicated no social, economic or political policy and was merely an ordinary individualized judgment made by the deputies as part of their routine work duties.

        Plaintiff fatherâs claims against county defendants for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress were barred by the discretionary function exception as the decisions made by the county officials relative to the childrenâs supervision and visitation implicated social, economic, and public policy considerations and the decisions made by the county regarding the childrensâ supervision and visitation were the type of decisions contemplated under the discretionary function exception and such decisions were to be afforded protection and shielded from judicial second-guessing.

        Subsection (1) of this section, provides two separate and independent grounds upon which a political subdivision can be held liable for injuries: (1) a political subdivision can be liable for injuries caused by some condition or use of property in the same manner as a private person, and (2) a political subdivision can be liable for injuries caused by the negligence or wrongful act or omission of an employee acting within the scope of the employeeâs employment.

       Each political subdivision is liable for money damages for injuries when the injuries are proximately caused by the negligence or wrongful act or omission of any employee acting within the scope of the employeeâs employment or office under circumstances in which the employee would be personally liable to a claimant in accordance with the laws of this state, or injury caused from some condition or use of tangible property, real or personal, under circumstances in which the political subdivision, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant. The enactment of a law, rule, regulation, or ordinance to protect any personâs health, safety, property, or welfare does not create a duty of care on the part of the political subdivision, its employees, or its agents, if that duty would not otherwise exist.

        Under this section, actions for ordinary negligence of an employee of a county are to be brought against the county; in such instance, N.D.C.C. Â§ 31-08-07 required a statement taken by plaintiff from deputy, who was at the accident scene, be provided to the deputy, or the county, or the purpose of the statute would be avoided. Olson v.

        Because N.D.C.C. ch. 32-12.1 does not immunize employees from their reckless, grossly negligent, willful, or wanton misconduct, a political subdivision and its employee may be jointly liable if an employee caused injury while acting within the scope of his employment in a reckless, grossly negligent, willful or wanton manner.

        Although N.D.C.C. ch. 32-12.1 immunizes employees from their ordinary negligence while acting within the scope of their employment, it does not negate the liability of political subdivisions for injuries caused by employees acting within the scope of their employment, whether or not such acts are those of ordinary negligence or reckless or grossly negligent conduct, or willful or wanton misconduct. The political subdivision remains liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for all acts of its employees performed within the scope of employment to the maximum amount specified in N.D.C.C.

     <p>
      An insurance policy or insurance contract purchased by a political subdivision or a government self-insurance pool in which a political subdivision participates pursuant to this chapter may provide coverage for the types of liabilities established by this chapter and may provide such additional coverage as the governing body of the political subdivision determines to be appropriate. The insurer may not assert the defense of governmental immunity, but this chapter confers no right upon a claimant to sue an insurer directly. If a dispute exists concerning the amount or nature of the required insurance coverage, the dispute must be tried separately. The insurance coverage authorized by this chapter may be in addition to any insurance coverage purchased by a political subdivision pursuant to any other provision of law and if premium savings will result therefrom, any insurance policy purchased pursuant to this chapter or any other provision of law may be written for a period which exceeds one year.

        Under this section, the defense of governmental immunity is waived when a political subdivision purchases liability insurance coverage; thus, when a political subdivision has such insurance coverage the liability protections afforded under N.D.C.C. ch. 53-08 are inapplicable. Fastow v. Burleigh County Water Resource Dist., 415 N.W.2d 505, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 427</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a political subdivision has no liability insurance coverage, its exposure for liabilities is limited to $250,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence. If, however, a political subdivision purchases insurance coverage in excess of those amounts, an injured plaintiff may receive judgment in the amount of the insurance coverage. Fastow v. Burleigh County Water Resource Dist., 415 N.W.2d 505, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 427</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       In action under former N.D.C.C. Â§ 40-43-07 authorizing political subdivisions to carry liability insurance, insurerâs assertion of defense of governmental immunity made it imperative that existence of liability insurance be alleged in complaint; however, injured party could not sue insurer directly but had first to establish liability of insured; in absence of any âdirect-actionâ statute and in view of policyâs âno action clauseâ providing that no action should lie against insurer until amount of insuredâs obligation was finally determined, injured party could not join insurer as party defendant to action against insured and another.

        This section specifies the maximum time in which an action may be brought against a political subdivision; it does not apply where a more restrictive statute of limitation is applicable. O'Fallon v. Pollard, 427 N.W.2d 809, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        If, as plaintiff argued, university participation in the North Dakota Insurance Reserve Fund constituted the purchase of insurance for purposes of waiving immunity based upon the provisions of this chapter, then it followed that the three-year statute of limitations was also applicable to her claim; it would stand the legislative intent on its head to conclude that the legislature intended the three-year statute of limitations to apply only to political subdivisions, which are not immune to suit, and not to the state and its agencies, which the legislature allowed to voluntarily waive their immunity by purchasing liability insurance pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t32c32-12.1s32-12.1-15" target="_self">32-12.1-15</a></cite>.

        Applying the provisions of N.D.C.C. Â§Â§
   1-02-05, 1-02-07 and 1-02-27, the trial court could not apply the three-year limitations period of N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.1-10 to bar the lesseesâ
   contract claims against the political subdivision, as the legislature intended that statute to apply only against tort claims against the state, which was separate from the political subdivision for liability purposes.

        District court did not err in determining that the husband and wife's personal injury claims were precluded by N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.1-10 where they had sued the park district, not the contractor, thus the three-year limitations period applied, the injuries accrued on the date the wife fell rollerblading, and the limitations period had expired by the time the couple had properly served the summons and complaint.

        District court did not err in dismissing as untimely plaintiffâs claims relating to her sonâs death. After speaking with an independent toxicologist on December 27, 2013, plaintiff was aware of facts sufficient to put her on notice of a potential claim, and she failed to sue defendants within three years of that date.

        Statute of limitations barred plaintiffsâ tort claims when it sued governmental defendants in October 2016. An agentâs initial knowledge of material deficiencies in May 2012 and his subsequent knowledge of additional deficiencies as the job continued through its completion on August 15, 2012, should have led plaintiff to inquire whether the county knew of the material deficiencies for the whole project when it issued the bid documents.

        The obvious purpose of this chapter is to limit exposure to potential liability. The reduced three-year period for commencing an action under the chapter furthers this purpose. In effect, the three-year statute of limitations is the legislatively imposed quid pro quo for the liability provided by the chapter. Olson v. University of N.

        Summary judgment dismissing the daughtersâ wrongful death and negligence claims was affirmed because the Texas defendants, employees of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, were immune from suit to the same extent the State of North Dakota would grant immunity to its employees under North Dakota law; the Texas defendants were immune from personal liability for negligent acts committed within the scope of employment but would not be immune for acts of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, and the daughters did not allege the Texas defendantsâ conduct was grossly negligent or intentional misconduct, thus as a matter of law, the Texas defendants were immune under Texas law. Texas law granted a broader immunity to state employees, only allowing suits resulting from motor vehicle accidents occurring within the scope of employment. Hansen v.

        Upon remand of the case to the trial court, the trial court under the authority of N.D.C.C. Â§ 1-02-39 could consider the factors listed in that statute to determine the appropriate limitations period to be applied to the lesseesâ
   contract claims against the political subdivision. The trial court needed to do so because it applied the wrong limitations period to determine that the contract claims were barred against the political subdivision, especially given the legislatureâs intent under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.1-01 that claims against political subdivisions be treated separately from claims against the state, that tort claims as recognized by the factors set forth in N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.1-02, that state tort liability was separate from political subdivision liability as contemplated under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.2-01, and that the legislature had provided a âcatch-allâ limitations provision for actions against only the state and its employees under N.D.C.C.

       The state may only be held liable for money damages for an injury proximately caused by the negligence or wrongful act or omission of a state employee acting within the employeeâs scope of employment under circumstances in which the employee would be personally liable to a claimant in accordance with the laws of this state, or an injury caused from some condition or use of tangible property under circumstances in which the state, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant. No claim may be brought against the state or a state employee acting within the employeeâs scope of employment except a claim authorized under this chapter or otherwise authorized by the legislative assembly. The enactment of a law, rule, or regulation to protect any personâs health, safety, property, or welfare does not create a duty of care on the part of the state, its employees, or its agents, if that duty would not otherwise exist.

       The liability of the state under this chapter is limited to a total of two hundred fifty thousand dollars per person and one million dollars for any number of claims arising from any single occurrence. The state may not be held liable, or be ordered to indemnify a state employee held liable, for punitive or exemplary damages. Any amount of a judgment against the state in excess of the one million dollar limit imposed under this subsection may be paid only if the legislative assembly adopts an appropriation authorizing payment of all or a portion of that amount. A claimant may present proof of the judgment to the director of the office of management and budget who shall include within the proposed budget for the office of management and budget a request for payment for the portion of the judgment in excess of the limit under this section at the next regular session of the legislative assembly after the judgment is rendered.

        Inmate failed to state a claim under Rule 12(b) alleging state antitrust violations under N.D.C.C. Â§ 51-08.1-08, requesting damages and equitable relief, because this section precludes the State from liability for inmate claims of injury or threatened injury to property; in addition, inmate could not recover equitable relief under N.D.C.C.

        Summary judgment dismissing the daughtersâ wrongful death and negligence claims was affirmed because the Texas defendants, employees of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, were immune from suit to the same extent the State of North Dakota would grant immunity to its employees under North Dakota law; the Texas defendants were immune from personal liability for negligent acts committed within the scope of employment but would not be immune for acts of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, and the daughters did not allege the Texas defendantsâ conduct was grossly negligent or intentional misconduct, thus as a matter of law, the Texas defendants were immune under Texas law. Texas law granted a broader immunity to state employees, only allowing suits resulting from motor vehicle accidents occurring within the scope of employment. Hansen v.

        In personal injury case against a university arising out of a studentâs fall on ice which had accumulated on a sidewalk outside a university-owned apartment building, summary judgment in favor of the university was affirmed, where the student failed to present evidence raising an inference that the university had prior knowledge that water was pooling and freezing on the sidewalk, causing a hazardous condition.

       </p>
       <p>
        Mere knowledge that melting snow may run onto a sidewalk and freeze is not enough to expose a landowner, who had cleared the snow from the sidewalk, to liability; therefore, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the State in a negligence action based on a slip and fall on an icy sidewalk because the Stateâs snow removal efforts at a state university did not expose it to liability since no dangerous condition was created.

       <p>
        Snow and ice immunity set forth in N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-12.2-02(3)(i) protected the State from liability for a car accident where although evidence showed that the snow or ice condition along the guardrail was caused by the Stateâs actions plowing the road, it also did not show that the Stateâs employeesâ actions were negligent. There was no evidence that the Department of Transportation employees did not comply with the Departmentâs snow removal policies, and the failure to remove the snowbank was not an affirmative act that caused the condition.

       The state may only be held liable for money damages for an injury proximately caused by the negligence or wrongful act or omission of a state employee acting within the employeeâs scope of employment under circumstances in which the employee would be personally liable to a claimant in accordance with the laws of this state, or an injury caused from some condition or use of tangible property under circumstances in which the state, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant.

        Public employeeâs failure to file his claim for reimbursement for higher insurance premiums when less expensive insurance was available within 180 days after his alleged injury was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered rendered his lawsuit against the state untimely. Moen v. State, 2003 ND 17, 656 N.W.2d 671, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        Trial court did not err in dismissing a state university professorâs suit against the university because, inter alia, he failed to exhaust his internal administrative remedies and failed to file timely notice with the state; the notice stated that the basis of his claim was three letters, the first of which was dated October 10, 2001. Accordingly, the time period in which the statute required a claim to have been filed would have ended, at the latest, on April 10, 2002 and the professor filed his notice in September of 2002.

        District court erred in ordering an agent of the Bureau of Criminal Investigations and the Attorney General to pay compensatory remedial contempt sanctions to the purported owner of a seized payloader because the purported owner moved for return of property under the Criminal Rules, the purported owner's contempt motion was indistinguishable from a civil tort claim against the State, and the purported owner did not comply with the statutory requirements for claims against the State.

      Upon approval of the director of the office of management and budget, an entity of the state may participate in a government self-insurance pool or may purchase insurance against liability of the entity and its employees for damages resulting from claims under this chapter. The director shall limit participation in government self-insurance pools and, except as provided in this section, the purchase of insurance to exposures determined to cause an excessive financial risk to the state risk management fund, including exposures reasonably expected to deplete the fund and have a significant detrimental impact on the stateâs budget. The director shall develop a state self-retention program that provides as much coverage as possible of potential liability recognized by this chapter, but that includes insurance purchases in a manner that is determined appropriate by the director in consultation with the state risk manager. The insurance may be provided by an insurance company authorized to do business in this state which the insurance commissioner has determined to be responsible and financially sound, considering the extent of the coverage required, or coverage may be provided by a government self-insurance pool. If a premium savings will result and the director of the office of management and budget approves, the insurance policy or memorandum of coverage may be in force from one through three years from the date of issue. The director may procure an excess loss reinsurance contract for the state.

     <p>
      The director of the office of management and budget shall establish a risk management motor vehicle accident review board to review any accident involving a motor vehicle owned or leased by the state and operated by a state employee that results in bodily injury or significant property damage. The board is composed of the director of the department of transportation, or the directorâs designee, who shall serve as chairman of the board; the director of the office of management and budget, or the directorâs designee; the superintendent of the highway patrol or the superintendentâs designee; and two state employees selected by the other board members to serve two-year terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      The risk management motor vehicle accident review board shall review accidents involving state-owned or state-leased vehicles operated by state employees that result in bodily injury or significant property damage in order to improve traffic safety and driver training and to reduce the number of traffic accidents. The board shall adopt rules concerning receiving accident reports, holding meetings, receiving verbal or written information, making recommendations, communicating with state agencies and employees, and informing state agencies of its recommendations. Three members of the board constitute a quorum and an affirmative vote of at least three board members is required for the board to take action and make a recommendation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The duties of the chairman include scheduling meetings; notifying participants; receiving and maintaining board records, reports, and other material; and communicating with agencies concerning the boardâs recommendations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department of transportation shall report state motor vehicle-related accidents to the board for review involving bodily injury or significant property damage or if there was a citation issued to the state employee operating the state-owned or state-leased motor vehicle. After review, the board may recommend driver training; defensive driver training; emergency vehicle operational training; physical, written, or operational examinations; or restrictions on the use of state-owned or state-leased motor vehicles. The state agency employing the employee operating the state-owned or state-leased motor vehicle involved in the traffic accident shall decide whether to implement the boardâs recommendation.
     </p>
     <p>
      State employees must be paid and may not be required to take any leave for time needed to assist the board, and all state employers shall reimburse their employees for travel expenses incurred in assisting the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      The board must be deemed to be a state agency loss-control committee under section 32-12.2-12 and all of the boardâs current or former members and all participants providing any verbal or written information to the board are entitled to the rights against production of records or testimony as contained in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department of transportation shall internally review all accidents involving a motor vehicle owned or leased by the state that is not submitted to the board for review to determine whether the accident was preventable and make recommendations to the agency employing the employee involved in the accident which may include recommendations on the same issues as made by the board.

       Notwithstanding any provision in this chapter to the contrary, an agency may agree to limit the liability of a contractor to the state if the agency determines such services or products cannot be effectively obtained without such limitation and the limitation does not pose any significant risk of loss to the state and is in the best interests of the state. The agency, in consultation with the office of management and budget and the attorney generalâs office, shall prepare a written documentation before agreeing to any liability limitation. An agencyâs authority to agree to a limitation of liability is limited to contracts for the purchase or lease of, or services related to, software, communication, electronic equipment, and economic forecasting.

       If the extent of potential direct loss is unknown, an agency may agree to limit direct damages to a reasonably estimated amount commensurate with the foreseeable risk of loss to the state. The amount must be equal to twice the total value of the contract, unless all parties to the contract agree to an alternative amount. Any agreed upon amount that is less than twice the value of the contract must be approved by the director of the office of management and budget. The liquidated damages and retainage provisions for delay, missed deadlines, and other breaches are not subject to a general limitation on direct or indirect damages authorized under this section.

        Although the old form of proceedings by writ of quo warranto and information in the nature of quo warranto is abolished, the jurisdiction and powers of the courts and the right to reach through them the remedies which that writ or information once afforded are not changed. Territory ex rel. Peterson v. Hauxhurst, 14 N.W. 432, 3 Dakota 205, 1882 Dakota LEXIS 19 (Dakota 1882).

       </p>
       <p>
        The legality of the proceedings of a school board in reforming a district which could be tested by the common-law writ of quo warranto may be tested by a civil action in the district court. Weiderholt v. Lisbon Special Sch. Dist., 41 N.D. 146, 169 N.W. 809, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 1918).

       <p>
        In a proceeding to review a void order of a school board, inquiry will not extend to a determination of the legality of prior acts of the board, which may be properly inquired into in a civil action substituted for quo warranto. State ex rel. Mayo v. Thursby-Butte Special Sch. Dist., 45 N.D. 555, 178 N.W. 787, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute providing that remedies formerly obtainable by the writ of quo warranto may be obtained by a civil action in the district court does not abolish the writ of quo warranto nor a proceeding by information in the nature thereof, but is cumulative and an additional procedure. State ex rel. Sathre v. Roberts, 67 N.D. 92, 269 N.W. 913, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1936).

        It is a purpose of quo warranto or an action in the nature of quo warranto to inquire into the ultimate legality of a municipal corporation. Hazelton-Moffit Special Sch. Dist. v. Ward, 107 N.W.2d 636, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 1961).

      It shall be sufficient to allege in the complaint that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the amount of the forfeiture claimed according to the provisions of the statute which imposes it, specifying the section and chapter containing such statute. When such section imposes a forfeiture for several offenses or delinquencies, it shall specify the particular offense or delinquency for which the action is brought, with a demand for judgment for the amount of such forfeiture. In case the defendant is not a resident of the state, an attachment may be issued in such action as in an ordinary civil action against nonresidents. Any such action may be brought for and the judgment therein may include as many forfeitures as the defendant may have incurred prior to its commencement.

    Forfeitures â How recovered by city, corporation, or limited liability company.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      All forfeitures imposed by any bylaw, ordinance, or regulation of any city or of any corporation or limited liability company organized under the laws of this state, when special provision is not otherwise made by law for their recovery nor punishment provided for the act or omission for which they are imposed, may be sued for and recovered pursuant to this chapter. It shall be sufficient to allege in the complaint that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiff in the amount of the forfeiture claimed, specifying the bylaw, ordinance, or regulation which imposes it. And when such bylaw, ordinance, or regulation imposes a penalty or forfeiture for several offenses or delinquencies, it shall specify the particular offense or delinquency for which the action brought, with a demand for a judgment for the amount of such forfeiture. All money collected on such judgment shall be paid to the city auditor or the treasurer of the corporation or limited liability company.

       Private property may not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation first having been made to or paid into court for the owner. When private property is taken by a person, no benefit to accrue from the proposed improvement may be allowed in ascertaining the compensation to be made therefor. Private property may not be taken for the use of, or ownership by, any private individual or entity, unless that property is necessary for conducting a common carrier or utility business. A determination of the compensation must be made by a jury, unless a jury is waived. The right of eminent domain may be exercised in the manner provided in this chapter.

       <p>
        The erection of poles in a street without the consent of or compensation to abutting owners constitutes an additional servitude. Donovan v. Allert, 11 N.D. 289, 91 N.W. 441, 58 L.R.A. 775, 95 Am. St. Rep. 720 (1902), decided prior to the adoption of Art. 1, Â§ 16 of the N.D. Const.
       </p>
       <p>
        The construction and operation of a telegraph and telephone line on a rural highway is not a highway use, within the purpose of its original dedication, but a new use, and it constitutes an additional servitude upon the fee of the abutting owner which entitles him to compensation. Cosgriff v. Tri-State Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 15 N.D. 210, 107 N.W. 525 (1906), decided prior to the 1969 amendment of N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-15-23, overruled on other grounds Otter Tail Power Co. v.

       <p>
        In eminent domain proceedings, the trial court has no power to stay the trial of the question of damages or compensation pending the final determination of the other issues. State ex rel. Northern States Power Co. v. Teigen, 80 N.W.2d 110, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 165</cite> (N.D. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily an award of compensation in a condemnation case will be sustained if the amount is within the limits testified to by the witnesses, but where the award is so flagrantly against the weight of the evidence that it appears the jury was actuated by bias or prejudice, the award will be set aside. Montana-Dakota Utils. Co. v. Culver, 80 N.W.2d 541, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1957); Northern States Power Co. v. Effertz, 94 N.W.2d 288, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        The closure of a street intersection by construction of an overpass unreasonably impaired the right of the business owners to have direct access to their property from the highway, and the intersection closure was a taking as a matter of law for which the property owners were entitled to a determination of just compensation for the taking. Boehm v. Backes, 493 N.W.2d 671, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 1992).

       <p>
        The issue of compensation for private property taken or damaged for public use must be tried to a jury, unless a jury is waived; all other issues in a condemnation action are triable to the court without a jury. Bigelow v. Draper, 6 N.D. 152, 69 N.W. 570 (1896), distinguished, City of Grafton v. St. Paul M. &amp; M. Ry., 16 N.D. 313, 113 N.W. 598, 22 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1 (1907); County of Pembina v.

        If the value of a tract of real estate is in controversy in condemnation proceeding, and the only evidence is that of experts, who differ in their opinions as to its value, the jury may not disregard all the evidence in the case and fix its value below the lowest or above the highest estimate of the experts, despite the fact that they may have inspected land under the order of the court. Bigelow v. Draper, 6 N.D. 152, 69 N.W. 570 (1896), distinguished, City of Grafton v. St. Paul M. &amp; M. Ry., 16 N.D. 313, 113 N.W. 598, 22 L.R.A. (n.s.) 1 (1907), City of Grafton v. S.

       <p>
        If property has been taken from the plaintiff for a public use, she is entitled to recover the value of the property and any and all damage whether the damage be direct, as when caused by trespass or physical invasion of the property, or consequential, as in diminution of the market value. Williams v. Fargo, 63 N.D. 183, 247 N.W. 46, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure of damages for condemnation of an easement for an electric transmission line right of way over land is the value of the easement taken, as determined by the depreciation in value of the landownerâs interest in the property before taking, and not by the value of the easement to the plaintiff. Otter Tail Power Co. v. Von Bank, 72 N.D. 497, 8 N.W.2d 599, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1942).

        Because a condemnation action is strictly in rem, and in personam jurisdiction is not required, Indian tribeâs defense of sovereign immunity was of no avail. Further, the Federal Nonintercourse Act, 25 USCS 177, did not apply to land which a tribe had purchased in fee, which was located hundreds of miles from its reservation, which had never been held in trust for the tribe, and which had been privately owned for over 100 years. Cass County Joint Water Res. Dist. v. 1.43 Acres of Land, 2002 ND 83, 643 N.W.2d 685, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 2002), overruled in part, Upper Skagit Indian Tribe v.

        District court erred in dismissing a public utilityâs eminent domain action because the proposed pipeline was an authorized use, the courtâs consideration of the railroad customerâs preference for gas by pipeline to heat its railroad switch misapplied the law, the necessity inquiry was the necessity of the utility, not that of the railroad, the district court substituted its judgment for that of the utility, and the landowner did not establish that the utility acted in bad faith, grossly abused its discretion, or committed fraud in determining whether its chosen route across his property was reasonably suitable in terms of the greatest public benefit and the least private injury.

        Since maintenance and repair of an electric power transmission line are essential to the efficient operation thereof, an easement for the location of the line carries with it, as an incident to the full, fair, reasonable and proper use thereof, the right of ingress and egress.

        Stateâs Interest in Roads.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Court properly granted summary judgment to an insurer in a declaratory judgment action where a semi-truck was not covered under a farmerâs policy because an exclusion contained limited exceptions which did not provide coverage for motor vehicles on public roads or highways.
   The semi-truck was indisputably driven on public roads and it was irrelevant whether the stateâs interest in highway abutting insuredâs property was treated as an easement or a fee interest, as the collision occurred more than two miles from the farm, and the driver had to cross several strips of highway that did not abut land owned by insured.
   The language of the policy precluded coverage for the semi-truck because it was designed for travel on public roads and subject to motor vehicle registration. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Cos. v. Lagodinski, 2004 ND 147, 683 N.W.2d 903, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 279</cite> (N.D. 2004).

Further, the Federal Nonintercourse Act, 25 USCS 177, did not apply to land which a tribe had purchased in fee, which was located hundreds of miles from its reservation, which had never been held in trust for the tribe, and which had been privately owned for over 100 years.

        District court erred in dismissing a public utilityâs eminent domain action because the proposed pipeline was an authorized use, the courtâs consideration of the railroad customerâs preference for gas by pipeline to heat its railroad switch misapplied the law, the necessity inquiry was the necessity of the utility, not that of the railroad, the district court substituted its judgment for that of the utility, and the landowner did not establish that the utility acted in bad faith, grossly abused its discretion, or committed fraud in determining whether its chosen route across his property was reasonably suitable in terms of the greatest public benefit and the least private injury.

        Condemnation damages award was not clearly erroneous because (1) landowners did not present sufficient evidence that the propertyâs fair market value, given the best and highest use found, was greater than the award, and (2) the court did not rely on evidence of project influence on valuation.

      Whenever in an action brought under the provisions of this chapter an issue is formed whereby it appears that the attendance of a jury will be necessary to assess the damages in such action, the plaintiff therein may apply to the judge of the district court where the same is pending for an order requiring a jury to be summoned to assess the damages in such action. Thereupon the judge shall issue an order to the clerk of said court requiring a jury to be summoned, and in such order shall specify the number of jurors to be drawn, the place where they are to appear, and the time when they shall come, which shall be not less than eight days nor more than thirty days from the date thereof.

        In an action to condemn an easement for a right of way for an electric transmission line, the only question for the jury to determine was that of damages. Otter Tail Power Co. v. Von Bank, 72 N.D. 497, 8 N.W.2d 599, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the duty of the court to proceed with the assessment of damages as rapidly as the procedure provided will permit, and the court has no power to stay such proceedings pending the final determination of other issues in the condemnation proceeding. State ex rel. Northern States Power Co. v. Teigen, 80 N.W.2d 110, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 165</cite> (N.D. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        The only function of a jury in eminent domain is to assess the damages. City of Minot v. Minot Hwy. Ctr., Inc., 120 N.W.2d 597 (N.D. 1963), distinguished, Hoffman v. Berry, 139 N.W.2d 529 (N.D. 1966) and Mitzel v. Schatz, 167 N.W.2d 519, 1968 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1968).

        For the purposes of removal to a federal court the demand for a jury is equivalent to filing of an answer, and where petition for removal has been filed more than thirty days after demand, the case will be remanded to the state court.

        This section requires the court to proceed rapidly and to finally determine the issue of damages, and whenever a jury is necessary to assess the damages the court should proceed without delay to summon the required number of jurors to be drawn; thus, district courtâs stay of compensation trial pending appeal on necessity of taking was error.

     <p>
      The jury, or court, or referee, if a jury is waived, must hear such legal testimony as may be offered by any of the parties to the proceedings and thereupon must ascertain and assess:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c32-15s32-15-22ol11">
       The value of the property sought to be condemned and all improvements thereon pertaining to the realty and of each and every separate estate or interest therein. If it consists of different parcels, the value of each parcel and each estate and interest therein shall be separately assessed.

       If the property sought to be condemned constitutes only a part of a larger parcel, the damages which will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned by reason of its severance from the portion sought to be condemned and the construction of the improvement in the manner proposed by the plaintiff.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-15s32-15-22ol13">
       If the property, though no part thereof is taken, will be damaged by the construction of the proposed improvement, the amount of such damages.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-15s32-15-22ol14">
       If the property is taken or damaged by the state or a public corporation, separately, how much the portion not sought to be condemned and each estate or interest therein will be benefited, if at all, by the construction of the improvement proposed by the plaintiff, and if the benefit shall be equal to the damages assessed under subsections 2 and 3, the owner of the parcel shall be allowed no compensation except the value of the portion taken, but if the benefit shall be less than the damages so assessed the former shall be deducted from the latter and the remainder shall be the only damages allowed in addition to the value of the portion taken.
      </li>

        Court erred in allowing expert witness to separately establish values for coal, gravel, and surface land on condemned property, and then to aggregate these sums to reach a total figure representative of the fair market value; mineral deposits cannot be made the subject of a separate evaluation apart from the land and simply added to the market value of the land as additional compensation for the taking, but should instead be considered as factors which influence or enhance the fair market value of the land.

        Where plaintiffs owned one of two contiguous parcels in fee and were joint tenants with the husbandâs parents in the other parcel, and the two parcels were operated as a unit, the value of the two units used together was a relevant and proper consideration in determining the value of the land taken from plaintiffs by condemnation and the amount of severance damages to the remainder of the unit wholly owned by plaintiffs.

        Ordinarily an award of compensation in a condemnation case will be sustained if the amount is within the limits testified to by witnesses, but where the award is so flagrantly against the weight of the evidence that it appears the jury was actuated by bias or prejudice, the award will be set aside.

        Where the trial courtâs findings were induced by its mistaken view of the law about business ownersâ foreknowledge of highway project when they completed their purchase of the property, although there was some evidence to support the trial courtâs findings that the loss of income may have been attributable to other causes, this evidence was more relevant to the amount of just compensation and a mistake had been made about whether the means of ingress and egress was substantially impaired.

        When the trial courtâs findings of fact as to the market value of a strip of land taken for highway purposes and severance damages and consequential damages to the remainder, by the construction of a relocated grade, are the result of deliberate weighing of conflicting opinion evidence of all witnesses, as shown by the memorandum of the trial judge, such fact findings are entitled to appreciable weight.

        An appeal on the issue of damages from a taking of land pursuant to section 14 of the constitution by state highway department for right of way purposes should be tried in the district court in the manner prescribed for trials under N.D.C.C. ch. 32-15., and the trial court, in a proper case, is governed by subsection 4 of this section.

        An owner of property taken under the power of eminent domain is entitled to be paid the value of the parcel of land taken, plus damages which will accrue to the remainder of the land by reason of its severance from the portion taken. Wishek Inv. Co. v. McIntosh County, 77 N.D. 685, 45 N.W.2d 417, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 1950); Minnkota Power Coop. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        In determining damages resulting to the owner from the taking of his property and that resulting from the severance of a portion, if a portion of the whole is taken, it is proper to consider such adaptability of the land for purposes other than that for which it is used at the time of taking as will in reasonable probability affect its present value. Wishek Inv. Co. v. McIntosh County, 77 N.D. 685, 45 N.W.2d 417, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 164</cite> (N.D. 1950).

       <p>
        General rule for determining the value of property taken under subdivision 1 is consideration of the fair market value of such property; fair market value being the highest price property can be sold for in the open market by a willing seller and a willing buyer, neither acting under compulsion and both exercising reasonable judgment.

        The owner of property taken under the power of eminent domain for a highway easement was entitled to severance damages equal to the diminution in value of his remaining property, where the property owner satisfied his burden of proof by presenting testimony of an experienced independent appraiser who testified that he used a comparable sales approach for appraising the property and that in his opinion the remaining propertyâs value was diminished because the best location for a homesite was within fifty feet of the easement.

        Where a portion of land not taken is adaptable for commercial and industrial purposes, although being used for agriculture, the fact of its location close to a city, transportation facilities, and recent sale of other contiguous land for commercial and industrial uses may be considered by the court in determining its present true value.

     <p>
      At any time after the entry of judgment, whenever the plaintiff shall have paid to the defendant, or into court for the defendant, the full amount of the judgment, the district court in which the proceeding was tried, upon notice of not less than three days, may authorize the plaintiff to take possession of and use the property during the pendency of and until the final conclusion of the litigation and, if necessary, may stay all actions and proceedings against the plaintiff on account thereof. The defendant, who is entitled to the money paid into court for the defendant upon judgment, shall be entitled to demand and receive the same at any time thereafter upon obtaining an order therefor from the court. The court, or a judge thereof, upon application made by such defendant, shall order and direct that the money so paid into court for the defendant be delivered to the defendant upon the defendantâs filing a satisfaction of the judgment, or upon the defendantâs filing a receipt therefor and an abandonment of all defenses to the action or proceeding except as to the amount of damages that the defendant may be entitled to in the event that a new trial shall be granted. A payment to a defendant as aforesaid shall be held to be an abandonment by such defendant of all defenses interposed by the defendant, except the defendantâs claim for greater compensation.

        This section clearly indicates that judgment must be entered upon verdict and that thereafter certain procedure must be followed; in condemnation action in which no judgment was entered prior to entry of order requiring payment to city of amount of uncertified and unreturned special assessments levied against property, landownerâs acceptance of check for full amount awarded in final order (which was less than jury verdict) and of check for attorneyâs fees and costs constituted settlement which deprived landowner of right to appeal from final order of condemnation even though landowner had conveyed property to condemnor covenanting that it was free from all encumbrances except installments for special assessments or assessments for special improvements which had not been certified.

        In an eminent domain action, where the plaintiff has established the necessity for the location of a route for a power transmission line and has taken easements for the construction thereof, and paid into court the amount of the damages ascertained by a jury, pursuant to this section, the trial court is authorized under the terms of N.D.C.C.

        N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-15-29 does not provide for the accrual of any interest following the deposit of the full judgment amount by the political subdivision. Although the statute appears to require unsatisfied landowners to make a difficult choice between withdrawing the deposit and limiting their appeal to a claim for greater compensation, or foregoing the use of the funds and preserving all of their potential issues on appeal, there is nothing in the statute suggesting the legislature intended something different. N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-15-29 does not provide for the accrual of postjudgment interest subsequent to a deposit of the full amount of the judgment by the political subdivision. City of Fargo v.

        Landownersâ award of attorney fees and costs in a condemnation action was not an abuse of discretion because (1) the fact that the landowners had been offered more than the damages award did not bar an award of fees and costs, (2) the landowners submitted sufficient supporting evidence, (3) a districtâs commissioning of a soil study and a large discrepancy in the propertyâs alleged value made the case more complex, and (4) it was not an abuse of discretion to decline to fault the landowners for an appraiserâs deficient testimony.

        The taxing of attorney fees by the prevailing party for an attorney representing a person who was not a party to the action, and for which fees the prevailing party in the lawsuit is in no way liable, is not permitted under this section. United Dev. Corp. v. State Highway Dep't, 133 N.W.2d 439, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 1965).

       <p>
        Where a prevailing party hires a number of attorneys during the course of a lawsuit, and where a statute permits âreasonable attorneyâs feesâ, he may tax only one attorneyâs fee for the litigation.

        The amount of reasonable attorneyâs fee in any given case is to be determined in the sound discretion of the trial court in view of all the surrounding, relevant circumstances of the case.

        Where the trial court determined the fees due the prevailing partyâs attorney on the basis of the fee due the attorney under the provisions of a contingent fee contract, without reference to whether such fees were reasonable for the services rendered in view of all the surrounding circumstances, such fees were not fixed in accordance with this section. The basis of such fee must be reasonableness. Morton County Board of Park Comm'rs v. Wetsch, 136 N.W.2d 158, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        In arriving at what is a reasonable attorney fee in each case, the court should consider the character of the services rendered by the attorney, the results which the attorney obtained for his client, the customary fee charged for such services, and the ability and skill of the attorney rendering the services. Morton County Board of Park Comm'rs v. Wetsch, 136 N.W.2d 158, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1965).

        Where the trial court determines that attorney fee charged the defendant upon the basis of a contingent fee contract between the defendant and his attorney was a reasonable fee under all the circumstances, it was within the sound judicial discretion of the court to award such fee as part of the costs due defendant under this section. Morton County Board of Park Comm'rs v. Wetsch, 142 N.W.2d 751, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite> (N.D. 1966).

       </p>
       <p>
        Award of $ 10,000 as attorneysâ fees was within trial courtâs discretion where appellate court was unable to find as a matter of law that the increase in a subsequent appraisal of value from $ 8,000 to $ 39,000 was not due to the skill, knowledge, experience, and efforts of the counsel for the landowner, showing the need for an increase in the deposit by the commissioner.

        In determining reasonable attorney fees, the court must first determine the number of hours the attorney has expended, then determine specific hourly rates based upon the attorneyâs experience and reputation, and make adjustments on the basis of objective evaluation of the complexity and novelty of the litigation and the corresponding degree of skills displayed by the attorney. City of Bismarck v. Thom, 261 N.W.2d 640, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1977), overruled in part, Cass Cty. Joint Water Res. Dist. v.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying attorney fees for time spent in seemingly overextended conferences with clients and witnesses and unsuccessful attempts to abort the trial in an eminent domain proceeding.

        This section, as amended in 1969, is broad enough to authorize reasonable attorney fees for defending an appeal of an eminent domain judgment by the board of county commissioners. Dutchuk v. Board of County Comm'rs, 429 N.W.2d 21, 1988 N.D. App. LEXIS 4 (N.D. Ct. App. 1988).

        Condemnee was entitled to have attorneyâs fees determined in light of the difference between the amount of the award and the initial deposit in order to measure the results obtained. City of Devils Lake v. Davis, 480 N.W.2d 720, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The âresults which the attorney obtained for his client,â as well as the âcustomary fee chargedâ are among the significant factors in allowing attorneyâs fees in eminent domain proceedings. City of Devils Lake v. Davis, 480 N.W.2d 720, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the reasonableness of the fee, and not the arrangement the attorney and his client may have agreed upon, which is controlling whenever the fee is to be assessed and included in the judgment; thus, plaintiffâs contingency agreement with counsel did not limit the trial courtâs attorney fee award. Cassady v. Souris River Tel. Coop., 520 N.W.2d 803, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in reducing a request for attorney fees to be proportionate to the damages awarded by the jury without explaining what work the court deemed unreasonable and why such work was unreasonable. City of Medora v. Golberg, 1997 ND 190, 569 N.W.2d 257, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Motions for attorneysâ
   fees pursuant to N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-15-32 by landowners who settled their claims in a condemnation action brought by a pipeline company, where one landowner requested $ 8,280 (55.2 hours at $ 150 per hour) in attorneysâ
   fees, and a second group of landowners requested $ 31,920 (212.80 hours at $ 150 per hour) and $ 1,823 in costs, were granted because the hourly rate and the number of hours expended were more than reasonable in light of the complexity of the litigation, the degree of skills displayed by each attorney, the character of the services rendered, the results which the attorney obtained, and the customary fee charged in the locality for such services.
   Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Co. v. Dolyniuk Family Trust, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12832 (D.N.D. June 27, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denying attorney fees incurred in challenging an order for examinations and surveys was not an abuse of discretion, in light of the preliminary nature of the proceedings and the district courtâs consideration of the appropriate factors. Alliance Pipeline L.P. v. Smith, 2013 ND 117, 833 N.W.2d 464, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Declining to award attorney fees incurred in making the application for attorney fees and costs was not error where the district court determined a reasonable number of hours expended by the attorneys for the entire action.

        In an eminent domain action, the district court abused its discretion by drastically reducing the first attorneyâs fees from the $159,180.33 requested to $30,000, by reducing the first attorneyâs billed time from 361 hours to 100 hours, without adequate explanation; thus, that portion of the judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for the district court to make a more understandable and detailed explanation. North Dakota DOT v. Rosie Glow, LLC, 2018 ND 123, 911 N.W.2d 334, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an eminent domain action, the district court adequately explained its reasoning and did not abuse its discretion in reducing the second attorneyâs hours to a total of eights hours in its award of attorneyâs fees because the court would not include hours spent traveling; although the trial lasted three days, a total of 18 hours and 26 minutes were on the record, including voir dire, testimony, and arguments outside of the juryâs presence, the second attorney listed 22.5 hours for trial time, but the second attorney only questioned one witness, the time spent on that witnessâs testimony in trial was approximately one hour, and the second attorney spent approximately five hours preparing for his witnessâs testimony. North Dakota DOT v. Rosie Glow, LLC, 2018 ND 123, 911 N.W.2d 334, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the provisions for cost-shifting in this section are âspecific,â the generalized cost-shifting provisions of N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(e), and N.D.C.C. Â§ 28-26-06(5) do not apply in eminent domain proceedings under this chapter, and the trial court has no statutory authority to assess the costs and fees of a cityâs expert appraiser against defendants. City of Jamestown v. Leevers Supermarkets, 552 N.W.2d 365, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        District court abused its discretion in awarding the city costs and disbursements against a property owner because an award of costs against a plaintiff landowner in an inverse condemnation action was statutorily precluded.

        Reducing the award of expert witness fees was not an abuse of discretion where an expertâs costs who had not testified at trial were excluded, and the appropriate factors as to the other experts were discussed. N.D. DOT v. Schmitz, 2018 ND 113, 910 N.W.2d 874, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       <p>
        In an eminent domain action, because the Department of Transportation chose to depose appellantâs expert witness, and appellant was entitled to recover those costs absent an agreement to the contrary, the district court abused its discretion in declining to award necessary expenses related to the expertâs deposition, and, on remand, the district court had to determine a reasonable amount for the expertâs preparation and deposition fees. North Dakota DOT v. Rosie Glow, LLC, 2018 ND 123, 911 N.W.2d 334, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       <p>
        In an eminent domain action, the district court referred to the non-exclusive factors to consider when awarding reasonable expert witness fees and did not abuse its discretion in awarding appellant $5,625 instead of the requested $7,500 for the expert witnessâs appraisal because the district court found nothing in the record provided a clear explanation of the services provided by the expert in completing his appraisal. North Dakota DOT v. Rosie Glow, LLC, 2018 ND 123, 911 N.W.2d 334, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       <p>
        When a landowner brings an action in inverse condemnation through which he receives a compensation for the taking or damaging of his property for public use it is proper for the trial court to award reasonable costs and attorney fees. Arneson v. Fargo, 331 N.W.2d 30, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where litigation remained an inverse condemnation action under N.D.C.C. ch. 32-15, defendant condemnors could not claim the benefit of N.D.C.C. Â§ 24-07-29 to the exclusion of N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-15-32, which governed the award of costs. Gissel v. Kenmare Township, 512 N.W.2d 470, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Landownersâ
   tort claims were not ârootedâ in any taking, but were based upon the independent grounds of nuisance and negligence, and they were actions and claims for relief entirely separate and distinct from the inverse condemnation claims, and the city was required to muster separate defenses to each claim; joining the tort claims with inverse condemnation claims did not preclude taxation of costs for the separate tort claims under N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(e) and N.D.C.C. Â§ 28-26-06, and the district court did not err in concluding it could tax costs for the tort claims against the landowners.
   Hager v. City of Devils Lake, 2009 ND 180, 773 N.W.2d 420, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly awarded costs to an owner as the prevailing party because what a city described as multiple inverse condemnation claims were merely several theories of damage, and the city was not eligible to recover costs where the cited statutes did not apply to eminent domain proceedings. Lincoln Land Dev., LLP v. City of Lincoln, 2019 ND 81, 924 N.W.2d 426, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 2019).

      When several cotenants hold and are in possession of real or personal property as partners, joint tenants, or tenants in common, in which one or more of them have an estate of inheritance, or for life or lives, or for years, an action may be brought by one or more of such persons for a partition thereof according to the respective rights of the persons interested therein and for a sale of such property or a part thereof, if it appears that a partition cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners. Real and personal property may be partitioned in the same action.

        Where one cotenant failed to pay his share of expenses of the property and a second cotenant paid all the expenses, and the nonpaying cotenant had not failed to make contribution to the paying cotenant within a reasonable time, the nonpaying cotenantâs failure to pay did not constitute an abandonment of his interest and, in a partition action, the nonpaying cotenant was allowed to retain his interest in the property by making contribution, along with interest, to the paying cotenant.

       </h5>
       <p>
        District court erred in dividing the land and ordering the partner to buy out the estateâs share of the farm machinery, because the district courtâs equitable powers in partition actions did not include the power to order one party to buy out the other partyâs share of jointly owned property; the authority to make compensatory adjustment between the respective parties was not equated with the authority to require a party to purchase property the party did not wish to purchase when the remedy of a forced sale was available, as the complexities of the remedy of a forced purchase were too great and the appellate court was unwilling to imply a power to require such a remedy without specific statutory authority akin to the existing statutory authority to require a forced sale.

        District court erred in denying a sonâs motion to compel discovery of his motherâs medical records because they were relevant to mental capacity and undue influence issues, particularly where the siblings relied on the absence of medical records to attack the sonâs claims; the validity of the quitclaim deed the mother executed was relevant because without it, the condominium would have been administered by her estate, and the son could not have legally occupied it without permission. Nelson v. Nelson, 2018 ND 212, 917 N.W.2d 479, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 219</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        District courtâs findings in a partition action were not clearly erroneous because (1) the findings were consistent with the applicable legal standard, and (2) it was not clear error to find partition would cause great prejudice to siblings, as the proceeds from ordering a partition of two-thirds of the subject property to the siblings were approximately 15% less than ordering a sale of the whole, and there was no bright-line rule declaring a decrease in value by a certain percentage was a serious pecuniary injury. Rieger v. Ackerman, 2020 ND 49, 939 N.W.2d 413, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 44</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        Factors considered in determining if great prejudice would result by partition in kind include: possible pecuniary gain or loss of each alternative; efficient management of the property; the situation of the parties and their respective financial abilities, including the financial ability of one of the parties to purchase the property at a sale; the location and character of the property; the size and respective shares of the parties if a partition in kind would be made; the availability of other land to avoid or reduce a loss where the issue involves the question of whether the property is physically divisible and can it be partitioned in kind without great pecuniary loss; a proposal by one owner to lease the land back to another owner; and, although subordinate to the pecuniary interests of the parties, sentimental reasons, particularly in the preservation of a home. Schnell v. Schnell, 346 N.W.2d 713, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1984).

      In making the partition, referees must divide the property and allot the several portions thereof to the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, according to the respective rights of the parties as determined by the court, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, designating the several portions by proper landmarks, and may employ a surveyor with the necessary assistants to aid them. Before making partition or sale the referees, whenever it will be for the advantage of those interested, may set apart a portion of the property for a way, road, or street, and the portion so set apart shall not be assigned to any of the parties, nor sold, but shall remain an open and public way, road, or street, unless the referees shall set the same apart as a private way for the use of the parties interested, or some of them, their heirs or assigns, in which case it shall remain such private way.

     <p>
      When it appears that the partition cannot be made equal between the parties according to their respective rights without prejudice to the rights and interests of some of them, and a partition is ordered, the court may adjudge compensation to be made by one party to another on account of the inequality, but such compensation shall not be required to be made to others by owners unknown, nor by an infant, unless it appears that such infant has personal property sufficient for that purpose and that the infantâs interest will be promoted thereby. In all cases, the court has power to make compensatory adjustment between the respective parties according to the ordinary principles of equity.

        Trial courtâs findings supported an equal partition of the partiesâ real and personal property where both parties contributed equally to the acquisition of assets such that the estate had to be divided equally and each party was entitled to 50 percent of the equity. McKechnie v. Berg, 2003 ND 136, 667 N.W.2d 628, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 149</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       </h5>
       <p>
        District court erred in dividing the land and ordering the partner to buy out the estateâs share of the farm machinery, because the district courtâs equitable powers in partition actions did not include the power to order one party to buy out the other partyâs share of jointly owned property; the authority to make compensatory adjustment between the respective parties was not equated with the authority to require a party to purchase property the party did not wish to purchase when the remedy of a forced sale was available, as the complexities of the remedy of a forced purchase were too great and the appellate court was unwilling to imply a power to require such a remedy without specific statutory authority akin to the existing statutory authority to require a forced sale.

        Where trial court ordered a partition sale of subject property with the net proceeds to be divided equally among its three cotenants, and the court divided the cost of the partition sale among the cotenants in proportion to their respective interests in the property, attorneys fees and costs were properly taxed in accordance with N.D.C.C.

Whenever such abstract is produced by the plaintiff before the commencement of the action, the plaintiff must file with the complaint a notice that an abstract of the title has been made and is subject to the inspection and use of all the parties to the action, designating therein where the abstract will be kept for inspection. If the plaintiff shall have failed to procure such abstract before commencing the action and any defendant shall procure the same to be made, the defendant, as soon as the defendant has directed it to be made, shall file a notice thereof in the action with the clerk of the court, stating who is making the same and where it will be kept when finished. The court or the judge thereof may direct, from time to time during the progress of the action, who shall have the custody of the abstract.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the court determines property subject to a partition action under section 32-16-01 is held by two or more cotenants in which one or more cotenants have an estate of inheritance, and a sale of the property is requested by one or more cotenant or is required to avoid an inequitable partition, the court shall appoint a referee to obtain an appraisal to determine the fair market value of the property. Upon the determination of the fair market value of the property, the court shall notify all parties to the partition action of the determination and amount of the appraisal. Upon receipt of the appraisal, a cotenant may purchase all interests of cotenants requesting a sale of the property, at the appraised fair market value of the selling cotenantâs fractional interest in the property. If more than one cotenant offers to purchase the interests of the cotenants requesting a sale of the property, the court shall equitably allocate the interests among the purchasing cotenants.

        This section provides for a satisfactory action to determine adverse claims and remove clouds on title. It affords such relief as is prescribed within the scope of the statute. The scope of that relief is not diminished by the fact that other relief may be available in the form of an appeal from administrative action. Mueller v.

        District court properly denied the claimants' motion to vacate the stipulated judgmentsâthat they had no financial or ownership interest in the minerals at issueâand in granting summary judgment to the owners in their quiet title action because the only argument addressed (and rejected) by the district court was whether the claimants could be relieved from the stipulated judgments inasmuch as they were not represented by counsel and did not fully understand the consequences of their stipulations, the claimants did not have, nor could they claim, an interest in the minerals where they expressly disclaimed any interests in them in their stipulations, and the resulting judgments stated that they had no claim in them.

        It was not the duty of the court in an action to quiet title under R.C. 1899, Â§ 5904, to consider and pass upon a tax lien set out by answer, but which did not arise from a tax sale. McHenry v. Kidder County, 8 N.D. 413, 79 N.W. 875 (1899), decided prior to the 1905 amendment to R.C. 1899, Â§ 5904 (R.C. 1905, Â§ 7519)(see now this section).

     <p>
      A recovery may be had in the action by any party against a defendant personally served or who has appeared, or against the plaintiff, for the value of the use and occupation of the premises and for the value of the property wasted or removed therefrom, in the case of a vendor holding over, or a trespasser, as well as in a case in which the relation of vendor and vendee has existed. If such recovery is desired by the plaintiff, the plaintiff shall allege the fact, stating particularly the value of the use and occupation, the value of the property wasted or removed, and the value of the real property aside from the waste or removal, and shall demand appropriate relief in the complaint. A recovery of possession also may be had by the plaintiff or any defendant asking for affirmative relief.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Vendorâs recovery for waste was not precluded by liquidated damages clause contained in the contract for deed as, regardless of how expansive the terms of a contract may be, its coverage can only extend to those events which the parties intended, and to conclude that the parties intended the liquidated damages provision to cover waste would require an unreasonable interpretation of the contract, which is prohibited by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.09.html#t09c9-07s9-07-18" target="_blank">9-07-18</a></cite>. Meyer v. Hansen, 373 N.W.2d 392, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 373</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>

        A provision for liquidated damages will not prevent recovery for actual damages for events which are not covered by the liquidated damages clause, unless the contract expressly provides that damages other than those enumerated shall not be recovered.

         Measurement of Damages for Waste.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Given the absence of an express legislative pronouncement, and given that the object of an award of damages is to compensate without unjust enrichment, there should be no exclusive test for measuring property damage for waste. Rather, the mode and amount of proof must be adapted to the facts of each case. Meyer v. Hansen, 373 N.W.2d 392, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 373</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Depending on the facts of each case, either diminution in value or cost of repair is the appropriate measure of damages for waste. Plaintiff has the right to elect the measure deemed more accurate and if the defendant disagrees, he has the burden to prove the alternative measure is more appropriate. Meyer v. Hansen, 373 N.W.2d 392, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 373</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        In an action to determine adverse claims to real property, where state claimed some interest in the land, the complaint was not demurrable because it failed to plead the filing of an undertaking to pay any judgment for costs. Brye v. Greenfield, 70 N.D. 597, 296 N.W. 746, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 205</cite> (N.D. 1941).

         Counterclaim.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an action to determine adverse claims, where a counterclaim is interposed by defendant asserting title in himself adverse and superior to that of the plaintiff, the defendant becomes as to his claim of title, in effect, a plaintiff and the court must determine and adjudicate the claims set forth in the counterclaim even though plaintiffâs cause of action may fail. Jester v. Jester, 76 N.D. 517, 37 N.W.2d 879, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 74</cite> (N.D. 1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a defendant in an action to quiet title answers and sets up his interest in or claim to the property involved and seeks affirmative relief by asking that his right or interest so pleaded be adjudged superior to the interest of the plaintiffs, the answer constitutes a counterclaim. Dixon v. Kaufman, 79 N.D. 633, 58 N.W.2d 797, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1953).

       <p>
        In an action to determine adverse claims, it is unnecessary to prove that the defendant asserts some estate or interest in, or lien upon, the real property in controversy. Klemmens v. First Nat'l Bank, 22 N.D. 304, 133 N.W. 1044, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 1911).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The description of a plaintiffâs estate, interest, or lien, in an action to determine adverse claims, is sufficient to constitute a cause of action if in the statutory form. Northwestern Improvement Co. v. Oliver County, 38 N.D. 57, 164 N.W. 315, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D. 1917).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The complaint in an action to determine adverse claims, which was approximately in the statutory form prescribed by this section, was sufficient and not vulnerable to attack by demurrer although it contained no particulars with respect to the title of the plaintiffs or the anticipated claims of defendants. Dixon v. Kaufman, 79 N.D. 633, 58 N.W.2d 797, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1953).

        <b>
         âPayment or Tender.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The tender of taxes is not a condition precedent to the recovery of land held under a tax title. Farrington v. New Eng. Inv. Co., 1 N.D. 102, 45 N.W. 191 (1890); Power v. Larabee, 2 N.D. 141, 49 N.W. 724 (1891); OâNeil v. Tyler, 3 N.D. 47, 53 N.W. 434 (1892), decided prior to the enactment of Â§ 57-0202, NDRC 1943 (see now this section); explained, Douglas v. Fargo, 13 N.D. 467, 101 N.W. 919, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is an utter absence of those things which are inherently essential to a valid tax, equity cannot require payment as a condition precedent to relief from the proceedings. State Fin. Co. v. Beck, 15 N.D. 374, 109 N.W. 357, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the assessment of taxes is inherently defective, it is not essential to tender taxes justly due in order to maintain action to quiet title. State Fin. Co. v. Bowdle, 16 N.D. 193, 112 N.W. 76 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to determine adverse claims to real property, the court may decree the payment of the amount of taxes due to the county at the date of such tax sale as a condition of granting relief, without the necessity of an offer to do so. Tee v. Noble, 23 N.D. 225, 135 N.W. 769, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 1912).

        In an action to quiet title, a corporation or person appearing of record as having a possible claim to, or interest in, the real property involved is a proper party to the action, and service upon such corporation or person as âunknown personsâ is insufficient to give the court jurisdiction. Northern Pac. Ry. v. Advanced Realty Co., 78 N.W.2d 705, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that persons proceeded against as unknown persons, in an action to quiet title, may have a deceased ancestor whose interest does not appear of record and who was not joined as a party to the action, does not affect the validity of the proceedings against such unknown persons. Nystul v. Waller, 84 N.W.2d 584, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 1957).

    Service on unknown defendants â How made â Affidavit for publication.

     <p>
      Service of the summons in an action may be had upon all unknown persons defendant by publication in the manner provided by law for service by publication upon defendants whose residence is unknown, but as to such unknown persons defendant the affidavit for publication shall be required to state in substance the following facts: That the interests of such unknown persons defendant in the land described in the complaint are not shown of record in the office of the recorder, the clerk of the district court, or the county auditor of the county in which such land lies, and the affiant does not know and is unable to ascertain the names, residences, or post-office addresses of any of the persons who are proceeded against as unknown persons defendant. The affidavit or complaint shall show further that the relief sought in the action consists wholly or partly in excluding the defendants from any interest in or lien upon specific real property in this state, and where jurisdiction is sought to be obtained against unknown persons under the provisions of this section, the summons shall state where the complaint is or will be filed, and there shall be subjoined to the summons as published a notice signed by the plaintiffâs attorney containing a description of the land to which such action relates. Unknown corporations and limited liability companies claiming interests are included within the word âpersonsâ as used in this chapter.

    Answer â Counterclaim.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In an action to determine adverse claims, a defendant in the defendantâs answer may deny that the plaintiff has the estate, interest, lien, or encumbrance alleged in the complaint, coupled with allegations setting forth fully and particularly the origin, nature, and extent of the defendantâs own claim to the property, and, if such defendant claims a lien, the original amount secured thereby and the date of the same, and the sum remaining due thereon, whether the same has been secured in any other way or not, and if so secured, the nature and extent of such security, or the defendant likewise may set forth the defendantâs rights in the property as a counterclaim and may demand affirmative relief against the plaintiff and any codefendant, and in such case the defendant also may set forth a counterclaim and recovery from a plaintiff or a codefendant for permanent improvements made by the defendant or those under whom the defendant claims, holding under color of title in good faith adversely to the plaintiff or codefendant against whom the defendant seeks a recovery. Such counterclaim shall set forth among other things the value of the land aside from the improvements thereon, and, as accurately as practicable, the improvements upon the land and the value thereof, and in such case such defendant also may set forth as a counterclaim the defendantâs demand for recovery of the value of the use and occupation of the premises and value of property wasted or removed therefrom. The answer shall be deemed served on codefendants by filing the same in the office of the clerk of court of the county where the action is pending at any time within twenty days after the service of summons on such defendant is complete. If affirmative relief is demanded against codefendants, the allegations constituting counterclaims shall be deemed controverted by all the parties, as upon a direct denial or avoidance, as the case may require, without further pleading.

The reply shall be served on such defendant and filed with the clerk within twenty days after the service of the defendantâs answer.

        In an action to quiet title, fraud is provable by the plaintiff against a claim or title set up in a counterclaim without being pleaded in a reply. Dixon v. Kaufman, 79 N.D. 633, 58 N.W.2d 797, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1953).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where an occupant of real property has made improvements in the honest but mistaken belief that he was the owner, and where as a result of a judgment in an action to quiet title such occupant will be deprived of all interest in and to the property upon which such improvements are made, the judgment may properly provide against unjust enrichment of the owner to the extent of the improvements. Benson v. Taralseth, 382 N.W.2d 649, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 265</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person who has failed to establish title to anotherâs property by adverse possession may gain a lien upon the otherâs property for the improvements made on the property. In other words, an owner may be forced to pay for improvements made on his property by a third party even when the improvements were made without his knowledge or consent. Benson v. Taralseth, 382 N.W.2d 649, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 265</cite> (N.D. 1986).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The plaintiff or any defendant who has answered may bring the case on for trial as other civil actions are brought on for trial. A defendant interposing a counterclaim for purposes of trial shall be deemed plaintiff, and the plaintiff and codefendants against whom relief is sought shall be deemed defendants as to the counterclaiming defendant. The court in its decision shall find the nature and extent of the claim asserted by the various parties, and shall determine the validity, superiority, and priority of the same. Any defendant in default for want of an answer, or not appearing at the trial, or a plaintiff not appearing at the trial, shall be adjudged to have no estate or interest in, or lien or encumbrance upon, the property, and such defendant also shall be adjudged to pay the amount demanded against such defendant in any counterclaim or reply for the use and occupation of the premises, property removed therefrom, and waste committed, except in the case of a defendant served by publication and not appearing. If any counterclaim for improvements has been urged against one recovering property, the value of such improvements thereof and the value of the land aside from the improvements shall be specifically found. There likewise shall be findings on all other counterclaims urged at the trial. If possession of the premises is demanded by the plaintiff or by any defendant asking for affirmative relief, such possession shall be awarded to the party asking for possession who has the paramount claim to the property, and such defendant thereupon may have a writ for possession as against all other parties to the action. Costs shall be awarded to the prevailing parties against each adversary in the action by the court, except that no costs shall be allowed against a defendant not appearing.

      If the decision of the court is in favor of one party for the recovery of the real property and in favor of another for improvements, the former shall have the option for sixty days after receiving notice that the findings are filed to pay the value of such improvements less such sums as may be found due for use and occupation and waste, or to take judgment against the other party for the value of the land aside from the improvements, as determined by the findings, and such sums as may be found due for use and occupation and waste. If such option is not exercised in writing by such party or such partyâs attorney, and filed with the clerk within sixty days, the other party thereupon may exercise the option for such party in like manner. If the party entitled to the possession of the property received in lieu thereof a money judgment, the other party may be subrogated to all the formerâs rights therein, including all the relief that party otherwise would be entitled to under the findings, and judgment thereupon shall be entered accordingly. Until payment is made by the party recovering the land, or until tender and deposit in the office of the clerk of the court in which the action is pending, no writ for the possession of the property shall be issued.

        A court of law, while a contest is pending, or prior to any decision of the land department, cannot hear and determine a contestantâs right of preemption in determining his right to possession of public lands.

        The rightful claimantâs possession or right to possession will always be protected or enforced against a trespasser by the appropriate action in court when that can be done without deciding a controversy of which the land department has exclusive jurisdiction.

         Exclusivity of Remedy.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The provisions for cancellation of land contracts contained in this chapter are not exclusive. Johnson v. Gray, 251 N.W.2d 923, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cancellation of a contract for deed by notice pursuant to this chapter is not an exclusive remedy; courts of equity have the power to cancel land contracts through cancellation by action, in which case no statutory written notice of intention to cancel is required and the period of redemption is left to the discretion of the court. Schumacher Homes v. J &amp; W Enters., 318 N.W.2d 763, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cancellation of a contract for deed by notice pursuant to this chapter is not an exclusive remedy. Striegel v. Dakota Hills, 365 N.W.2d 491, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        An option for cancellation in a contract for deed does not make cancellation the vendorâs exclusive remedy. Striegel v. Dakota Hills, 365 N.W.2d 491, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well settled that cancellation of a contract for deed by notice pursuant to this chapter is not an exclusive remedy. Adolph Rub Trust v. Rub, 474 N.W.2d 73, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 911, 112 S. Ct. 1276, 117 L. Ed. 2d 502, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 1494 (U.S. 1992).

        Whether the cancellation of a land contract is governed by the law of the situs or of the place of making and performance is a question of local common law not reversible on writ of error to a state court. Kryger v. Wilson, 242 U.S. 171, 37 S. Ct. 34, 61 L. Ed. 229, 1916 U.S. LEXIS 1546 (U.S. 1916).

       <p>
        The word âassignsâ includes the vendee of the purchaser, when known to the vendor, and notice must be served upon such vendee in order to forfeit the contract. Williams v. Corey, 21 N.D. 509, 131 N.W. 457, 1911 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        A vendor, upon cancellation of a contract for deed by the service of notice, may maintain an action of forcible detainer against the purchaser upon his refusal to surrender possession. E. J. Lander &amp; Co. v. Deemy, 46 N.D. 273, 176 N.W. 922, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        A vendor in a land contract having notice or knowledge that the vendee has assigned his interest in the contract must serve notice of cancellation on the assignee. Raasch v. Goulet, 52 N.D. 707, 204 N.W. 338, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the decree of a foreclosure was based on a default available to the vendor, and held to be controlling, a nonresident purchaser cannot claim that his rights were foreclosed without due process for lack of actual notice. Kryger v. Wilson, 242 U.S. 171, 37 S. Ct. 34, 61 L. Ed. 229, 1916 U.S. LEXIS 1546 (U.S. 1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the purchaser under a contract for deed mortgaged his interest, the mortgagee was an equitable assignee of the purchaserâs interest and, in an action to cancel the contract for deed, the seller, who knew of the mortgageeâs interest, should have joined the mortgagee as a party defendant and, because of his failure to do so, the interest of the mortgagee was not terminated; in an action by the seller for the purpose of quieting title as against the interest of the mortgagee, the mortgagee was given reasonable time within which to make good the purchaserâs default. Knauss v. Miles Homes, Inc., 173 N.W.2d 896, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 65</cite> (N.D. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a party fails to comply with the terms of a contract without receiving the mutual agreement of all other parties to rescind the contract, a breach of the contract for deed occurs and a breaching party is entitled to receive notice of that breach under this section. In re Flaten, 50 B.R. 186, 1985 Bankr. LEXIS 5960 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        If a seller elects to cancel the contract by action, no statutory written notice of intent to cancel the contract is required. Adolph Rub Trust v.

       <p>
        Where the vendor cancelled the deed by action and demonstrated that the repeated failure of the purchasers to make timely payments had caused her severe economic hardship, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in providing a two-month redemption period. Straub v. Lessman, 403 N.W.2d 5, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 281</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a seller cancels by action there is no statutory redemption period; rather, the matter is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. Adolph Rub Trust v. Rub, 474 N.W.2d 73, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 911, 112 S. Ct. 1276, 117 L. Ed. 2d 502, 1992 U.S. LEXIS 1494 (U.S. 1992).

       <p>
        Trial court erred in awarding vendors a money judgment in their action upon default of a contract for deed where the judgment also provided that if the money judgment was not satisfied before a certain date, then the contract for deed was, without more, cancelled or the vendors could proceed to foreclose the contract for deed pursuant to N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-06; the award of the money judgment in addition to the other remedies provided by the judgment would permit the vendors to accomplish indirectly what they could not accomplish directly through an action pursuant to the cancellation statutes, N.D.C.C. ch. 32-18, or foreclosure statutes, chapter 32-19. Langenes v. Bullinger, 328 N.W.2d 241, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 372</cite> (N.D. 1982).

        If it is admitted or shown by separate written instrument that the transaction is not an unconditional sale, but a mortgage or a sale with the right to repurchase, the court is inclined to construe the transaction as a mortgage, and on any question whether the mortgage or conditional sale was intended, any substantial doubt as to the intention will be resolved in favor of the construction that the conveyance is a security for a debt.

     <p>
      The vendee or purchaser, or the vendeeâs or purchaserâs assigns, shall have the following periods of time after the service of notice of cancellation upon such party in which to perform the conditions or comply with the provisions upon which the default shall have occurred:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c32-18s32-18-04ol11">
       If the amount claimed due under such instrument at the date of notice is more than sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the original indebtedness, the time allowed to correct the default shall be six months.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-18s32-18-04ol12">
       In any other case, the time for correction shall be one year.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Upon such performance and upon making such payments, together with the cost of service of such notice, such contract or other instrument shall be reinstated and shall remain in full force and effect as if no default had occurred therein. If, however, such vendee or purchaser, or such vendeeâs or purchaserâs assigns, shall not complete such performance or make such payment within the time periods provided by this section, the contract shall be terminated and shall not be reinstated by any subsequent offer of performance, or tender of payment. No provisions in any contract for the purchase of land or an interest in land shall be construed to obviate the necessity of giving the aforesaid notice and no contract shall terminate unless such notice is given, any provision in such contract to the contrary notwithstanding, but the notice herein required shall not be deemed necessary if the contract in question is sought to be terminated by an action at law or in equity brought for that purpose upon failure to perform. This section shall apply to all instruments for a future conveyance of real estate or an equity therein which are executed on or after July 1, 1971. The time allowed to correct the default shall not be less than one year except in contracts involving an area not to exceed three acres.

       <p>
        An attempt by a defaulting vendee under a land contract to recover a portion of the purchase price is in derogation of the contract, and is not aided by the fact that the vendor has not canceled the contract under this section. Harrington v. Eggen, 51 N.D. 87, 199 N.W. 447, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1924).

        A vendor cannot both cancel the executory contract for the sale of land and recover the purchase price. Vail v. Evesmith, 62 N.D. 99, 241 N.W. 719, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1932).

       <p>
        In North Dakota, a contract for deed is essentially a mortgage and not an executory contract; therefore, debtor could not be compelled to assume or reject purchaserâs interest in contract for deed under United States Bankruptcy Code.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an action by a vendor to cancel a contract for deed because of late payments by purchasers, trial court acted within scope of its equitable discretion by permitting purchasers to make payments to bring contract for deed current within thirty days from entry of judgment, thus reinstating contract for deed, rather than setting a redemption period during which time entire balance due on contract for deed would have to be paid in order to redeem, where purchasers raised equitable defenses of waiver and estoppel; contract for deed did not contain an acceleration clause; and, although contract for deed contained a âtime is of the essenceâ clause, vendors had accepted numerous late payments in past and had not given purchasers notice that they must comply strictly in future with terms of contract for deed concerning payment dates.

        Trial court had not erred when it awarded attorneyâs fees to a property owner where the purchasers in the eviction action under a contract for deed sought an injunction; however, the record did not provide the appellate court with sufficient information to ascertain whether, and if so, how much of, the attorney fee award was proper or improper because of the appellate courtâs ruling that the district court had erred in granting fees for positions asserted by the purchasers prior to litigation in connection with the cancellation of the contract for deed and their refusal to vacate the property.

        In North Dakota, a contract for deed is essentially a mortgage and not an executory contract; therefore, debtor could not be compelled to assume or reject purchaserâs interest in contract for deed under United States Bankruptcy Code. In re Faiman, 70 B.R. 74, 1987 Bankr. LEXIS 182 (Bankr. D.N.D. 1987).

      The plaintiff may not obtain a deficiency judgment in a foreclosure of residential property with four or fewer units of up to forty contiguous acres [16.19 hectares] containing a residence occupied by the owner as a homestead. The plaintiff may obtain a deficiency judgment on agricultural land of more than forty acres [16.19 hectares] but solely for the difference between the amount of the debt and the fair market value of the land at the time of commencement of the action. The plaintiff may obtain a deficiency judgment in all other cases for the difference between the appraised value, as determined by a licensed appraiser appointed by the court at the request of the plaintiff, and the amount determined due. The cost of the appraisal is an allowable cost in the foreclosure action.

        In cases involving mortgages on real property only, this section and N.D.C.C. Â§Â§ 32-19-06 and 32-19-07, require the mortgagee to foreclose on the mortgage and prohibit an action by the mortgagee directly on the debt. Northern Trust Co. v. Buckeye Petroleum Co., 389 N.W.2d 616, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 341</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A lender that takes a mortgage on real property as security for a debt foregoes its right to proceed initially against the mortgagor directly on the debt, but receives in return the added protection of an interest in the property. The mortgagee may still recover any deficiency from the mortgagor, but must fully comply with the provisions of this section and N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-06 to do so. H &amp; F Hogs v. Huwe, 368 N.W.2d 553, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 326</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The obvious intent of the statute is to require notice to the defendant in a foreclosure action that he is subject to personal liability for the balance of the debt remaining after sale of the mortgaged premises. Production Credit Ass'n v. Lund, 389 N.W.2d 585, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 339</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statement in plaintiffâs complaint that it âmayâ seek a deficiency judgment in a separate action provided the defendants with precisely the notice contemplated and required by this section. Use of the term âmayâ instead of âshallâ did not render the notification less effective. Production Credit Ass'n v. Lund, 389 N.W.2d 585, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 339</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        North Dakota law does not impose an absolute prohibition against a mortgagee seeking a deficiency judgment. Rather, it requires that a mortgagee seeking a deficiency judgment proceed in an action separate from the foreclosure action and that the mortgagee so proceed only after foreclosure and sale of the property. United States v. Larson, 632 F. Supp. 1565, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26394 (D.N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-07 precludes a mortgagee from bringing an action against a mortgagor for a personal money judgment except as permitted by this section and N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-06, which allow a deficiency judgment under very limited circumstances and then only for the amount by which the sum adjudged to be due exceeds the fair value of the foreclosed premises as determined by a jury. Schiele v. First Nat'l Bank, 404 N.W.2d 479, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Where mortgagors each signed a mortgage note and a written guaranty in the full amount of the mortgage note, it was improper for the lender bank to proceed against the personal guaranties of the mortgagors instead of foreclosing on the mortgage.

        When a mortgagee chooses to foreclose against only one of several items of real estate collateral, the appropriate balance requires that the fair value of the foreclosed item be determined by a jury before the remaining debt is enforced against the other items of real estate collateral.

        This statute clearly contemplates that actions at law may have been begun and pursued to judgment prior to the commencement of the foreclosure action. Burrows v. Paulson, 64 N.D. 557, 254 N.W. 471 (1934), decided prior to the amendment to this chapter by Session Laws 1937, ch. 159; and Session Laws 1951, ch. 217. Liberty Nat'l Bank v.

        An allegation of an assignment of a mortgage to a plaintiff and of ownership of the notes sufficiently shows plaintiffâs title thereto, as well as to the mortgage, although the notes appear to be payable to another person.

        This section does not require that a judgment in a foreclosure action contain a decree of sale; in a consolidated action for foreclosure of mortgage securing partnership debt and for recovery against individual partners on their guaranties of payment of the partnership debt, it was proper for judgments to give mortgagee the option to proceed first against the individual partners and attempt to collect on their guaranties with recovery to be set off against recovery in any later attempt to foreclose, or to immediately seek a decree of sale in the foreclosure action which would have the effect of satisfying in full the judgment or any balance due thereunder in the guaranty action.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A lender that takes a mortgage on real property as security for a debt foregoes its right to proceed initially against the mortgagor directly on the debt, but receives in return the added protection of an interest in the property. The mortgagee may still recover any deficiency from the mortgagor, but must fully comply with the provisions of this section and section 32-19-04 to do so. H &amp; F Hogs v. Huwe, 368 N.W.2d 553, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 326</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        If a vendor of a land contract commences an action for the foreclosure of the land contract, the anti-deficiency statutes provide that the court shall not render a deficiency judgment against the vendee except under very limited circumstances provided for in this section. In order to obtain a deficiency judgment, the vendor must bring a separate action against the party personally liable for that part of the debt, with recovery limited to the difference between the amount adjudged to be due, plus the costs of the action, and the fair market value of the land. Hagan v. Havnvik, 421 N.W.2d 56, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        Remedies of mortgagee or vendor after default are to: (1) foreclose without asking for deficiency judgment; (2) foreclose, asking for deficiency judgment in separate action after sale of the property, and obtain a judgment for only the difference between the mortgage debt plus costs and the fair value determined by a jury against both mortgagors and nonmortgagors personally liable on note; or (3) sue on note without foreclosure but with recovery limited to difference between amount due on note plus costs and fair value of property determined by jury.

        Trial court erred in awarding vendors a money judgment in their action upon default of a contract for deed where the judgment also provided that if the money judgment was not satisfied before a certain date, then the contract for deed was, without more, cancelled or the vendors could proceed to foreclose the contract for deed pursuant to this section, with the money judgment not being extinguished in either event; the award of the money judgment in addition to the other remedies provided by the judgment would permit the vendors to accomplish indirectly what they could not accomplish directly through an action pursuant to the cancellation statutes, N.D.C.C. ch. 32-18, or foreclosure statutes, ch. 32-19.

        Where, in exchange for the bankâs agreement to forego the monthly escrow payment, debtor entered into a âseparateâ contract with the bank, apart from the note and mortgage, to pay the real estate taxes and assessments, court did not permit the bank to evade the anti-deficiency judgment statutes through the guise of this âseparateâ agreement; the mortgage at all times remained intact as security for the payment of principal and interest and debtorâs obligations under the âseparateâ agreement were with the exception of principal and interest, precisely the same obligations debtor had pursuant to the terms of the mortgage.

       <p>
        The rights and defenses granted debtors by the anti-deficiency judgment law would be largely illusory if a prospective creditor could compel a prospective debtor to waive them at the time the mortgage is executed. Because of the public policy against deficiency judgments, the procedural rights granted mortgagors and vendees under the anti-deficiency judgment law cannot be contractually waived in advance of default. Brunsoman v. Scarlett, 465 N.W.2d 162, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        A mortgagor or vendee who, after default, determines that his or her position in a controversy can be improved by waiving certain procedural rights and benefits granted by the anti-deficiency judgment law should not be precluded from contractually waiving those rights. In recognition of public policy which encourages settlements, contractual post-default waivers of a debtorâs procedural rights under the anti-deficiency judgment law do not violate public policy. Brunsoman v. Scarlett, 465 N.W.2d 162, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Considering the strong public policy against deficiency judgments and the view that the anti-deficiency judgment statutes are debtor-protection legislation to be construed âstrictly in favor of mortgagorsâ a debtorâs contractual waiver of procedural rights under these statutes must be clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous. The waiver cannot arise by implication and the mortgagee or vendor bears the risk of any ambiguity in the agreement. Brunsoman v. Scarlett, 465 N.W.2d 162, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1991).

    Deficiency judgments on commercial real property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In an action involving the foreclosure of a mortgage on commercial real property, the plaintiff shall state in the pleading whether a deficiency judgment will be sought and if sought shall identify the parties claimed to be personally liable and demand a deficiency judgment against those parties. Within twenty days after the completion of the appraisal, the appraiser shall provide the plaintiff and file with the clerk of court a written report, including the fair market value of the property. The plaintiff shall mail a copy of the appraisal to a party that may be personally liable at the partyâs last-known residences or business addresses by first-class mail. At the time of the entry of the judgment, the court shall include in its findings of fact the fair market value of the property and the amount of any prior liens on the property. If the fair market value and the amount of any prior liens are less than the amount found to be due to the plaintiff, the court shall identify each person who is liable for any deficiency after the sheriffâs sale. The foreclosure judgment must be the balance then due and owing on the mortgage, plus costs. Upon entry of an order confirming the sheriffâs sale, the clerk of court shall note the amount bid at the sheriffâs sale, less the cost of the sheriffâs sale as a credit on the foreclosure judgment, which credit may not be less than the fair market value established by the court. Any amount actually paid in excess of the foreclosure judgment constitutes surplus payable to the debtor pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-23s28-23-09" target="_blank">28-23-09</a></cite>. The clerk shall enter a money judgment to the extent of the deficiency against those parties found by the court to be personally liable, then the plaintiff may pursue the same remedies to collect the deficiency judgment as are available to collect other money judgments. The deficiency judgment must be for the entire amount found to be due the foreclosing party in the foreclosure judgment, together with interest at the rate provided in the note secured by the mortgage, less the amount credited by the clerk of court. In addition to the appraisal, the court in its determination of the fair market value of the property may consider affidavits from the parties or other proof of paramount liens and other matters that may affect the value.

    Deficiency judgments on agricultural land.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the complaint in an action to foreclose on agricultural land of more than forty acres [16.19 hectares] has provided for a deficiency judgment, a separate action for the deficiency must be brought within ninety days after the sheriffâs sale. In the separate action, a deficiency judgment may be entered, but may not be in excess of the amount by which the sum adjudged to be due and the costs of the action exceed the fair market value of the mortgaged premises. There is not a presumption that the premises sold for the fair market value. The court may not render a deficiency judgment unless the fair market value as determined by the court is less than the sum adjudged to be due and costs of the action. Fifteen daysâ notice of the time and place for determination of fair market value must be given to all parties against whom personal judgment is sought. Any party may offer evidence to show the fair market value even though that party may not have otherwise appeared in the action for a deficiency judgment. Any deficiency judgment obtained may only be enforced by execution within three years from the date of entry of the judgment. If the judgment is not collected within three years, the judgment expires. As used in this section, âfair market valueâ means the most probable price that real property can be sold for in the open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer, neither acting under compulsion and both exercising reasonable judgment.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of state law, if a promissory note or other obligation and a mortgage, other than a first mortgage, upon real estate have been given to secure a debt contracted on or after August 1, 1993, a mortgagee may bring an action on the promissory note if the mortgagee waives the right to foreclose the mortgage given to secure the note. Allowing a mortgagee to bring an action on the promissory note or other obligation of the mortgagor if the mortgagee waives the right to foreclosure of the mortgage given to secure the note applies only to residential real property consisting of four or fewer residential units.

        This statute was not intended to put a limitation on the subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts. Instead, the purpose of this statute is to prevent creditors from obtaining deficiency judgments against mortgagors except under statutorily prescribed limitations, and it is the function of the district court to enforce this statute when applicable.

        A lender that takes a mortgage on real property as security for a debt foregoes its right to proceed initially against the mortgagor directly on the debt, but receives in return the added protection of an interest in the property. The mortgagee may still recover any deficiency from the mortgagor, but must fully comply with the provisions of this section and section 32-19-06 to do so. H &amp; F Hogs v.

        North Dakota law does not impose an absolute prohibition against a mortgagee seeking a deficiency judgment.

Brunsoman v. Scarlett, 465 N.W.2d 162, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        A mortgagor or vendee who, after default, determines that his or her position in a controversy can be improved by waiving certain procedural rights and benefits granted by the anti-deficiency judgment law should not be precluded from contractually waiving those rights. In recognition of public policy which encourages settlements, contractual post-default waivers of a debtorâs procedural rights under the anti-deficiency judgment law do not violate public policy. Brunsoman v. Scarlett, 465 N.W.2d 162, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       Mortgagee who foreclosed under C.L. 1913, Â§ 8100, as amended by S.L. 1933, ch. 155, was relegated to an action at law to recover any deficiency remaining after a sale of the mortgaged property and the application of the proceeds on the mortgage debt.

     <p>
      A party in a foreclosure action or the successor of a party may redeem from the foreclosure sale within sixty days after the sale, except for abandoned property as provided in section 32-19-19 and agricultural land. Agricultural land may be redeemed within three hundred sixty-five days after the filing of the summons and complaint in the office of the clerk of district court or the time of the first publication of the notice by advertisement. The final date for redemption of agricultural land may not be earlier than sixty days after the sheriffâs sale. The owner of the property has a paramount right to redeem upon paying the amount bid at the sheriffâs sale plus interest on that amount at the same rate as the obligation secured by the mortgage. Persons holding subordinate liens on the property may redeem in the order of priority as determined by the order of attachment to the property. This redemption has the effect of a redemption as of the date of deposit, subject to the subsequent payment of any additional amount, if any, determined to be due as of that date.

      The court, by injunction, on good cause shown, may restrain the party in possession from doing any act to the injury of real property during the existence of the lien or foreclosure of a mortgage on the real property and until the expiration of the time allowed for redemption. If at the time of the commencement of the foreclosure action and at any time before the sheriffâs sale the mortgagee, or after the sheriffâs sale the holder of the sheriffâs certificate of sale, reasonably believes that the property is abandoned, the mortgagee or holder of the sheriffâs certificate may allege abandonment in the complaint or petition the court to determine abandonment. If by petition, a notice of hearing must be sent by mail to the last-known address of the mortgagor or the party entitled to possession of the real property at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing to determine abandonment. Service by mail is complete upon mailing. If the court determines the real property is abandoned, the court may eliminate the redemption period in the foreclosure judgment or, upon petition, grant the mortgagee or holder of the sheriffâs certificate immediate possession and use of the property and all benefit and rents from the property until expiration of the redemption period. The court may consider remedies to prevent waste in a foreclosure action or upon a petition for abandonment. The provisions of this section concerning abandoned real property do not apply to agricultural property as defined by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.57.html#t57c57-02s57-02-01" target="_blank">57-02-01</a></cite>.

       Session Laws 1989, chapter 394, effective April 11, 1989, as amended by chapter 360, S.L. 1991, effective July 3, 1991, provides to farmers, effective through June 30, 1993, and after that date ineffective, the right to redeem homesteads separately from other property; amends and reenacts section 28-23-07, relating to waivers of right to designate lots at execution sale; and repeals chapter 194 of the 1987 Session Laws, relating to redemption of separate known lots or parcels of property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 1 of chapter 394, S.L. 1989, is a declaration by the Legislative Assembly which provides that it is in the best interest of the state to protect farm families from the dislocation caused by the financial crisis in agriculture, and that the act is enacted in accordance with N.D. Const., Art. XI, Â§ 22, which requires the legislative assembly to adopt wholesome laws protecting homesteads.

       â
       <b>
        Separate redemption of homestead â Notice.
       </b>
       In any proceeding to foreclose any mortgage upon agricultural property as defined in subsection 1 of section 57-02-01, including a proceeding under chapter 15-03, 15-08, 32-19, 32-19.1, or 35-22, the executing creditor shall notify the debtor that the debtor may redeem the property described in section 47-18-01 separately from the remaining property. The notice required in sections 32-19-20 and 35-22-03 must contain a statement substantially similar to the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       WARNING: This creditor is seeking foreclosure on agricultural property that may contain your homestead. Under North Dakota law, you have the right to redeem the lot or parcel that contains your homestead separately from the remaining property that is being foreclosed upon, by paying the purchase price, plus interest and costs, within the redemption period, which is generally one year from the date of the sale. The purchase price is the price bid at the foreclosure sale for that lot or parcel. You should consult with an attorney so you do not lose these valuable rights. You must provide the sheriff and the register of deeds [now recorder] with an accurate legal description of the homestead you wish to redeem either at the sale or at least ten business days [but see section 4 printed below] before the date of the scheduled sheriffâs sale. If the creditor is foreclosed by action, an additional copy of the notice must be served with a summons and complaint. If the creditor is foreclosing by advertisement, an additional copy of the notice must be served no later than forty-five days before the date of the scheduled sale. The notice must be served in the same manner as service of a summons and complaint.â

       â
       <b>
        Designation of homesteads to be separately redeemed.
       </b>
       The debtor may designate a reasonably compact contiguous area including the debtorâs dwelling but not to exceed one hundred sixty acres [64.75 hectares] to be sold separately at the foreclosure sale by serving a copy of the legal description of the property claimed under this section on the sheriff, the register of deeds [now recorder], and the parties to the foreclosure proceeding at least ten business days before the date of the scheduled sheriffâs sale.â
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 5 of chapter 394, S.L. 1989, provides a procedure by which a party to foreclosure proceedings may contest the designation of property to be separately redeemed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 6 of chapter 394, S.L. 1989, provides that any sheriff who receives a designation of the legal description of property under section 4 of the act shall offer and sell that parcel separately from the remaining property, unless otherwise ordered by the court under section 5 of the act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 7 of chapter 394, S.L. 1989, provides a procedure for the redemption of homestead designated by the debtor after foreclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 8 of chapter 394, S.L. 1989, provides that no redemptioner or purchaser may subsequently redeem or purchase the property designated by the debtor under section 4 of the act if the debtor exercises the right to redeem or purchase it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 9 of chapter 394, S.L. 1989, describes the right of certain debtors to purchase homesteads acquired by lenders.

      <p>
       Section 11 of chapter 394, S.L. 1989, as amended by section 2 of chapter 360, S.L. 1991, provides that the act is effective through June 30, 1993, and after that date is ineffective.

       <p>
        If a mortgagor is in default for failure to pay two annual interest notes secured by a real estate mortgage, and if notice of the exercise of an option to declare the whole amount due has been served, a subsequent tender of the interest during the thirty-day notice period does not cure the default nor reinstate the mortgage.

       <p>
        Filing of affidavit of proof of service of notice of intention to foreclose is not a condition precedent to the commencement of the action and failure to file does not operate to divest court of jurisdiction. Nonweiler v. Rettinger, 65 N.D. 436, 259 N.W. 500, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 1935).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The requirement that the notice before foreclosure under this section âmustâ contain a statement advising the mortgagor of the right to have the property sold in parcels, connotes an imperative or mandatory requirement; therefore, in any proceeding to foreclose a mortgage upon agricultural property the notice before foreclosure is legally insufficient unless it includes the required language. Federal Land Bank v. Waltz, 423 N.W.2d 799, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Notice by mortgagor of amount due in foreclosure does not set a limit on the trial court in its findings of the true amount owed to the bank; it is merely a prerequisite to the foreclosure to the mortgage to advise the mortgagor of the contemplated foreclosure to the end that he may make payment or cure the default and thus save the costs and trouble incident to foreclosure. First W. Bank &amp; Trust v. Wickman, 527 N.W.2d 278, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 10</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Failure to give notice of intention to foreclose does not affect in any manner the debt secured by the mortgage, nor does it give rise to a counterclaim or valid defense against collection of amount claimed to be due. Larson v. Jacobson, 54 N.D. 69, 208 N.W. 833, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a bank voluntarily moved to dismiss a foreclosure proceeding because it defectively served the notice before foreclosure less than 30 days before commencement of the proceeding, there was no merit to mortgagorsâ argument that the bank could not serve a second notice before foreclosure before the dismissal of the first proceeding. United Valley Bank v. Lamb, 2003 ND 149, 669 N.W.2d 117, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Strict compliance with the notice before foreclosure provisions is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to the district courtâs exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over the foreclosure action, and therefore an inaccurate description of the property and failure to file the notice with the complaint did not render the judgment void as a matter of law. Northwestern Nat'l Life Ins. Co. v. Delzer, 425 N.W.2d 365, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1988).

         Acceleration of Debt in Notice.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If a creditor could accelerate the entire debt in the notice before foreclosure and make payment of that accelerated amount a condition for reinstatement of the mortgage, the provisions of reinstatement of the mortgage in this section would be surplusage because the mortgage would have been satisfied upon payment of the entire accelerated debt. That result is contrary to the rule of statutory construction that, whenever possible, meaning and effect are given to every provision of a statute. State Bank v. Lindberg, 436 N.W.2d 12, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        The requirement that notice before foreclosure under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-20 âmustâ contain a statement advising the mortgagor of the right to have the property sold in parcels, connotes an imperative or mandatory requirement; therefore, in any proceeding to foreclose a mortgage upon agricultural property the notice before foreclosure is legally insufficient unless it includes the required language.

        The language of this section and N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-28, when read together, authorizes reinstatement of the mortgage by paying the amount actually in arrearage (i.e., the âamount dueâ) under this section within thirty days after service of the notice before foreclosure. If the title owner pays the amount actually in arrearage, he will have performed the conditions or complied with the provisions upon which default in the mortgage shall have occurred within the meaning of N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-28 and the mortgage shall be reinstated. State Bank v. Lindberg, 436 N.W.2d 12, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1989).

     <p>
      In any case, service of the notice before foreclosure is sufficient if it actually was received by the title owner or by the personal representative of the ownerâs estate. A United States post-office registry return receipt showing that the envelope containing the notice has been delivered to the record title owner or to the personal representative of the ownerâs estate, or to the agent of either, is prima facie evidence that the owner or the ownerâs administrator or executor received the same.

      Proof of service of notice before foreclosure may be made by the return of a sheriff or other officer, or by affidavit of the person making personal service or mailing such notice. Proof of death of the title owner of record may be made by a certified copy of the death certificate or by affidavit of any person having knowledge of the fact. Proof of any other fact necessary to show the notice was properly served, service was attempted and refused or unclaimed, or the property is abandoned may be made by certificate of a proper officer or of an abstracter or by affidavit of any person having knowledge of the facts. Such proofs together with the notice must be filed with the complaint in any action for the foreclosure of a mortgage and must be recorded with the notice and certificate of sale in foreclosures by advertisement.

        If a creditor could accelerate the entire debt in the notice before foreclosure and make payment of that accelerated amount a condition for reinstatement of the mortgage, the provisions of reinstatement of the mortgage in this section would be surplusage because the mortgage would have been satisfied upon payment of the entire accelerated debt. That result is contrary to the rule of statutory construction that, whenever possible, meaning and effect are given to every provision of a statute. State Bank v.

        The purpose of a notice before foreclosure is to afford the record title owner an opportunity to be informed of the proposed foreclosure so that he can pay the amount due and avoid the cost, expense, and annoyance of foreclosure.

        The language of N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-21 and this section, when read together, authorizes reinstatement of the mortgage by paying the amount actually in arrearage (i.e., the âamount dueâ) under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-19-21 within thirty days after service of the notice before foreclosure. If the title owner pays the amount actually in arrearage, he will have performed the conditions or complied with the provisions upon which default in the mortgage shall have occurred within the meaning of this section and the mortgage shall be reinstated. State Bank v. Lindberg, 436 N.W.2d 12, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly entered a judgment in favor of a lender in its mortgage foreclosure action because, while the lenderâs notice before foreclosure showed an amount less than what was owed to satisfy the judgment and the borrower raised the defective notice issue during the pendency of the action after the lender moved to amend its complaint, the defect did not impair the borrowerâs right to reinstate the mortgage and was not fatal to the lenderâs foreclosure action where, had he paid the amount due under the notice, the mortgage would have been reinstated and the lender would have been required to start the process over to foreclose the mortgage.

    Warrant to seize property â Issuance â Service.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If the plaintiff is not in possession of the property, the judge of the court in which the action is commenced, at the time of the commencement of the action or at any time before judgment, may issue a warrant commanding the sheriff to seize and safely keep the same to abide the final judgment in the action. The warrant may be issued upon the filing of:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c32-20s32-20-02ol11">
       A verified complaint setting forth a claim for relief in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant for the foreclosure of a lien upon the property possession of which is sought to be obtained; and
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-20s32-20-02ol12">
       An affidavit stating that the affiant knows or has good reason to believe that the seizure of the property is necessary to prevent removal, destruction, or concealment of the property or loss of the creditorâs proprietary interests therein.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The sheriff shall without delay serve copies of the warrant, affidavit, and undertaking upon the defendant in the same manner as the summons. If the defendant has not filed a special answer, pursuant to this chapter, within ten days after notice of the issuance of a warrant or if in the trial of the special answer the court finds for the plaintiff, the sheriff shall seize the property of the defendant. The sheriff shall attach perishable property or property the judge has determined, when issuing a warrant, is likely to be removed, destroyed, or concealed if the property is not attached without delay, notwithstanding the right of the defendant to file a special answer.

     <p>
      Within ten days after notice of the issuing of a warrant to seize the defendantâs property, the defendant may, by special answer, deny the existence, at the time of the making of the affidavit, of the material facts stated therein, and may assert undue hardship as a defense. The issue so raised must be tried by the court before the trial of the action, and the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff. If the defendant has made an assignment for the benefit of the defendantâs creditors, the defendantâs assignee may answer and defend pursuant to this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In making its determination of the issue raised by the special answer, the court shall consider any undue hardship on the defendant that would result from an issuance of the warrant. If the court finds for the defendant, the judge shall tax the defendantâs costs of such trial, and shall enter an order dismissing the warrant or that the property attached be delivered to the defendant; and the jury or the court shall, on the trial of the action or thereafter, assess the damages sustained by the defendant by reason of the taking and detention or sale of the property attached or by reason of any injury thereto. The same, together with the costs so taxed, must be a setoff to the plaintiffâs demand, and if in excess of it, or the plaintiff fails to recover, the defendant shall have judgment for the amount due. If the court on the trial of such special issue finds for the plaintiff, the judge shall tax the plaintiffâs costs of such trial, and the amount so taxed must, if the plaintiff recovers, be taxed by the clerk as disbursement in the action. If the defendant or the defendantâs assignee recovers judgment in the action, said costs and the judgment must be offset.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In an action for the foreclosure of a lien on personal property, judgment in favor of the plaintiff must specify the amount due on the lien and must direct a sale of the property to satisfy the same and the costs, by a person appointed thereby, or by an officer designated therein, in the manner provided for the sale of personal property under execution, and the application by the person or officer of the proceeds of the sale, less the personâs or officerâs fees and expenses, to the payment of the judgment and costs. It also may provide for the payment of the surplus to the owner of the chattel and for the safekeeping of the surplus, if necessary, until it is claimed by the owner. If the defendant upon whom the summons is served personally is liable for the amount of the lien, or for any part thereof, judgment may be entered against the defendant accordingly. A judgment for either the defendant or plaintiff must specify any amounts awarded pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t32c32-20s32-20-04" target="_self">32-20-04</a></cite>.2.

        Wrongful death claim under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-21-01 fell squarely within the protections of N.D.C.C.

Because there was a factual dispute as to whether the bar owners exercised reasonable and ordinary care in ejecting the decedent from the bar a second time, and whether injury or death was foreseeable as a result of the ejection, judgment on the pleadings was not appropriate.

        Verdict of five thousand eight hundred dollars to mother for wrongful death of her son, aged twenty-nine, who was unmarried, in good health, and a good farmer, residing with and devoted to her, was not excessive. Schultz v. Winston &amp; Newell Co., 68 N.D. 674, 283 N.W. 69, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1938).

        Seventy thousand dollars was an appropriate award for wrongful death of fifty-six-year-old wife who had been in good health, was active in care and counseling of her husband, kept business records, was a good housekeeper, tended to incidental affairs, and left two adult sons. Brauer v. James J. Igoe &amp; Sons Constr., 186 N.W.2d 459, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 165</cite> (N.D. 1971).

        In awarding damages for death, a jury may consider pecuniary value of services which the beneficiary might reasonably have expected. Stejskal v. Darrow, 55 N.D. 606, 215 N.W. 83, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1927), overruled, Hopkins v. McBane, 427 N.W.2d 85, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       </p>
       <p>
        Mortality tables introduced in evidence are not binding on the jury, and jury may decide that mother suing for wrongful death of son will live beyond her computed life expectancy. Schultz v. Winston &amp; Newell Co., 68 N.D. 674, 283 N.W. 69, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial damages could be awarded under the Wrongful Death Act, even though no mortality tables were introduced in evidence. Schultz v. Winston &amp; Newell Co., 68 N.D. 674, 283 N.W. 69, 1938 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 156</cite> (N.D. 1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Factors to be considered by jury in an action for benefit of wife and minor children for wrongful death of husband include the decedentâs age, health, condition in life, habits of industry and sobriety, mental and physical capacity, disposition to frugality, opportunities and customary earnings of the deceased and use he made of them and his expectation of life. Umphrey v. Deery, 78 N.D. 211, 48 N.W.2d 897, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Age, circumstances, condition, and relation to the deceased of the party or parties for whose benefit the action was brought may be considered. Umphrey v. Deery, 78 N.D. 211, 48 N.W.2d 897, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Papers used by decedent in preparing his income tax return were competent evidence of the value of the pecuniary support he furnished to his family, and could be considered by jury in determining his earning capacity. Skramstad v. Miller, 78 N.D. 450, 49 N.W.2d 652, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1951).

        Damages are not limited to those for loss of money or income, but include loss of any and all services which a child would probably have received from his father or mother. Dahl ex rel.

        A wife-plaintiff in an action for wrongful death of her husband is a privy to that action as a representative and heir, but is not a privy to that action in her capacity as an individual bringing a subsequent action for her personal injuries arising from the same transaction and is not entitled to summary judgment on doctrine of res judicata in action against same defendants.

        Where special administrator represented the estate in defending third-party action for contribution and represented decedentâs surviving parents in prosecuting counterclaim for wrongful death, the application of the collateral estoppel doctrine rested upon the status and financial interest of decedentâs beneficiaries and not upon the identity of the administrator in the two actions; estoppel could not be asserted against the parents on the wrongful death claim unless they could be said to have been a party to or in privity with the administrator in his defense of the contribution claim or unless they were otherwise bound by the judgment on that claim.

        Trial courtâs findings that husband, who had been separated from decedent for more than two years, suffered no loss, economic or otherwise, as a result of her death, while decedentâs 11-year-old daughter suffered substantial loss from the death of her mother, upon whom she solely relied for her support and care, and that daughter was not disqualified from receiving a share of the wrongful death damages because her negligent driving of automobile caused her motherâs death, as the sole proximate cause of the accident was negligent entrustment of the automobile to her, was not clearly erroneous.

        Brothers and sisters are included in the term âheirs at lawâ. Satterberg v. Minneapolis, St. P. &amp; S. St. M. Ry., 19 N.D. 38, 121 N.W. 70, 1909 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        âHeirs at lawâ as used in this section is to be construed in its technical legal sense as used in the law of intestate succession; it is to be considered the equivalent of âheirsâ, since the statute also refers to a âdecedentâ and thereby excludes persons whose interest is in the nature of an expectancy prior to the death of the deceased. Broderson v. Boehm, 253 N.W.2d 864, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The âheirs at lawâ mentioned in this section are not limited to persons named in N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-21-03, but include any persons who may succeed to the property of an intestate; such persons may be collateral heirs, but only when there are no closer legal heirs as determined under the law of intestate succession; therefore, personal representative of deceased twelve-year-old girl, killed with her mother in an automobile accident, was not entitled to recover damages on behalf of the decedentâs younger sisters where her father also survived.

        Where a federal habeas petitioner challenged a deprivation of good time credits, a potential state remedy under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-22-01 was yet to be exhausted where petitioner failed to appeal the denial of his state habeas petition by the district court to the North Dakota Supreme Court and did not bring an original habeas petition to the North Dakota Supreme Court pursuant to the authority conferred by N.D. Const. Art. VI, Â§ 2, a remedy for which there did not appear to be a time limit; the North Dakota Supreme Court could have disagreed with the respondentâs argument that N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-22-01 barred consideration of the petitionerâs claims.

       <p>
        Habeas corpus proceeding to determine custody of child is in the nature of an equitable action and is to be determined upon equitable principles by what appears to be for the best interests of the child. In re Custody of Wagner, 84 N.W.2d 587, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The objectives and procedures used in a writ of habeas corpus, unless substantially modified, are unrealistic and inappropriate for determining the custody of a child, especially because of changed circumstances where the best interests of the child are involved; the better procedure for litigant seeking custody of a child because of changed circumstances is to initiate an action or proceeding by using a complaint, petition, or application stating the facts and the nature of the matter and the remedial relief sought, or by a motion if the parties are the same as those in the divorce decree or judgment, and requesting an evidentiary hearing whenever the evidence is in dispute. Mansukhani v. Pailing, 300 N.W.2d 847, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 321</cite> (N.D. 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 818, 102 S. Ct. 98, 70 L. Ed. 2d 88, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 3139 (U.S. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where divorced father to whom custody of the children had been granted was killed, trial court order awarding divorced mother custody of the children in a habeas corpus proceeding without an evidentiary hearing was vacated and remanded for an evidentiary hearing as to the best interest and welfare of the children where the writ of habeas corpus was not used to free the children unlawfully detained of their liberty or to enforce a decree or judgment, but was used in an effort to obtain custody of the children because of changed circumstances, and the grandparents, who were also wanting custody, made an adequate request before the trial court to convert the habeas corpus proceeding into an evidentiary hearing. Mansukhani v. Pailing, 300 N.W.2d 847, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 321</cite> (N.D. 1980), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 818, 102 S. Ct. 98, 70 L. Ed. 2d 88, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 3139 (U.S. 1981).

       <p>
        Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act was intended to replace the habeas corpus statutes insofar as persons arrested for or convicted of criminal violations are concerned; the act does not unconstitutionally restrict the right to habeas corpus since the post-conviction statutes are not less favorable to the accused than the habeas corpus provisions; legislatureâs failure to repeal habeas corpus statutes was attributed to fact they remained applicable to civil matters. McGuire v. Warden of State Farm (State Penitentiary), 229 N.W.2d 211, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Without expressly stated circumstances warranting an exception, supreme court will decline to hear applications for habeas corpus which properly belong under post-conviction remedies. Smith v. Satran, 295 N.W.2d 118, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 267</cite> (N.D. 1980).

     </h3>
     <p>
      When, upon application to the supreme court for a writ of habeas corpus, it is apparent that no necessity exists for its immediate issuance, and a district court has entertained an application for the writ, and, upon hearing, quashed it, the supreme court will require all the papers, including the application and supporting affidavits, the return and supporting affidavits, and the order of such lower court, to accompany the application made to said court. In emergency cases, the foregoing requirement may be waived.

     <p>
      Whenever the writ is directed to the sheriff or other ministerial officer of the court out of which it is issued, it must be delivered by the clerk or by such person as it may be entrusted to, without delay, as other writs are delivered to such sheriff or other officer for service, or it may be left with the jailer, keeper, or other person under such sheriff or other officer in charge of and at the jail or place where the person seeking the writ may be imprisoned or restrained. If it is directed to any other person, it may be delivered to the sheriff or sheriffâs deputy and be by the sheriff or sheriffâs deputy served upon such person by delivering the same to such person without delay. If the person to whom the writ is directed cannot be found or refuses admittance to the officer or person serving or delivering such writ, it may be served or delivered by leaving it at the residence of the person to whom it is directed, or by affixing it to some conspicuous place on the outside either of that personâs dwelling house or of the place where the party is confined or under restraint. In any case the court issuing the writ, at its discretion, may authorize any person to serve and deliver it by an entry signed by the judge thereon to the following effect: âI hereby authorize
   _____________________________________
   to serve the within writâ, and service made by such person in the manner designated in this section shall be due and lawful service.

        Where Indian was arrested on reservation without warrant by deputy sheriff of adjacent county for felony committed in that county and no contention was made that felony was not committed or that officer did not have reasonable grounds to believe that Indian had committed it, arrest did not deprive Indian of rights under constitution or laws or treaties of United States, and thus he was not entitled to habeas corpus; failure to take Indian before nearest magistrate in county where arrest was made, but rather taking him before magistrate of county in which offense was triable, was not prejudicial and did not entitle Indian to habeas corpus.

      When it appears to any court authorized by law to issue the writ of habeas corpus that anyone is illegally held in custody, confinement, or restraint, and that there is reason to believe that the person will be carried out of the jurisdiction of the court, or will suffer some irreparable injury before compliance with the writ of habeas corpus can be enforced, the court may cause a warrant to be issued reciting the facts and directed to the sheriff or coroner of the county, commanding the officer to take the person thus held in custody, confinement, or restraint, and forthwith bring that person before the court to be dealt with according to law. The court also may insert in the warrant a command for the arrest of the person charged with the illegal detention and restraint.

     <p>
      The supreme court or any district court within this state, or any judge of any such court, may issue a writ of habeas corpus to bring the body of any person confined in any jail in the state before such court or judge to testify or to be surrendered in discharge of bail. Where a writ is issued for any such purpose and the witness or principal sought is confined in any jail in a county other than the county in which such person is to be surrendered, or to which such person is to be removed, and where such writ is executed and returned by an officer to whom it is directed, the jailer from whose custody such person is taken shall be exonerated from liability for an escape if:

       An attested copy of such order is delivered to the said jailer.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A declaratory judgment, by its very nature, is intended to clarify the rights of parties before those rights are violated. Once rights are violated, declaratory relief is inappropriate. Allen v. Minot, 363 N.W.2d 553, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Where the plaintiff was not asking that his prospective rights be determined, but rather, was seeking redress for a violation of his rights which he alleged had already occurred, declaratory relief was inappropriate.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The Declaratory Judgment Act is intended to provide a method whereby the parties to a justiciable controversy may have such controversy determined by a court in advance of the invasion of any rights. G. W. Jones Lumber Co. v. Marmarth, 67 N.D. 309, 272 N.W. 190, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 1937); LANGER v. STATE, 69 N.D. 129, 284 N.W. 238, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        The parties in a declaratory judgment action cannot by consent, either express or passive, transform a controversy that is not justiciable into one which is justiciable. LANGER v. STATE, 69 N.D. 129, 284 N.W. 238, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 1939).

        A justiciable controversy must exist before a declaratory judgment action can be maintained. United Pac. Ins. Co. v. Aetna Ins. Co., 311 N.W.2d 170, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 387</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no justiciable controversy, and district court lacked jurisdiction to render a declaratory judgment deciding which of two insurers had the duty to defend and provide coverage to an insured, where the liability of either insurer was contingent upon the outcome of an action by a third party against the insured which was still pending in the district court. United Pac. Ins. Co. v. Aetna Ins. Co., 311 N.W.2d 170 (N.D. 1981), decided prior to the amendment to N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-23-06 by Session Laws 1983, ch. 377.

        District court had subject matter and personal jurisdiction to determine cities' rights and obligations under a contract to build and operate a waste water treatment facility and consider partition of the facility because (1) the court was a court of general jurisdiction, and (2) proper service of process under N.D.

        Declaratory relief may be granted even though the declaration would not terminate the underlying controversy if the declaration can be of some help to end the controversy; for purposes of appeal, supreme court suggests that there be a showing of how the declaration aids in the disposition of the basic controversy where it may be otherwise obvious that the declaratory relief would not dispose of such controversy. Aberle v. Karn, 316 N.W.2d 779 (N.D. 1982), decided prior to the amendment to N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-23-06, by Session Laws 1983, ch. 377.

        Appeal was reviewable because the court's January 2014 order and subsequent consistent judgment were intended to be a final judgment on all proceedings relating to the lessors' action for declaratory relief; further, the January 2014 judgment dismissing lessee's counterclaim against the lessor also effectively dismissed the lessors' claim against the lessee's president.

       <p>
        A courtâs authority to grant declaratory relief requires exhaustion of administrative remedies. Tooley v. Alm, 515 N.W.2d 137, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        Plaintiff does not have to exhaust administrative remedies before court can grant declaratory relief based upon interpretation of unambiquous statute, because interpretation of an unambiguous statute is not an issue generally reserved to an administrative decisionmaker.

        Claims by former property owners (FPOs) against the new owners were barred by the doctrine of issue preclusion because it had been previously decided in a state court action that the FPOs lacked a contractual interest in the property, such that they could not relitigate that issue under a tortious interference claim.

        Declaratory judgment is proper to determine if a particular dispute is subject to arbitration under a labor-management contract providing for binding arbitration of grievances; however, once it is determined that a dispute is subject to arbitration, the resolution of the actual dispute is for the determination of the arbitrator and is not ripe for declaratory judgment.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although this section initially empowers courts to determine any question of construction or validity arising under a written contract and other writings constituting a contract, the statute also allows courts to determine questions of construction or validity for any person âwhose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchiseâ. North Dakotaâs Declaratory-Judgment Act has been liberally construed and has not been confined to the construction of formal writings. Thus the fact that a case involves an oral contract would not be sufficient of itself to preclude use of the Hoops v. Selid, 379 N.W.2d 270, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        In a case in which the personal representative petitioned the probate court for direction regarding a settlement offer in a separate civil action, and respondents cited no authority precluding the probate court from providing direction on the settlement of the separate civil action in the context of a supervised administration, the probate court did not abuse its discretion in providing the personal representative with the authority to manage the separate civil action.

        The court in its discretion may refuse to render a declaratory judgment where it would not terminate the uncertainty or controversy giving rise to the proceeding, and courts should strive to avoid granting declaratory judgments if to do so would entail piecemeal litigation of the matters in controversy.

        Action for declaratory judgment to determine the validity of a cash lease of farm property was not inappropriate because a breach of the lease had already occurred, or because plaintiffs could instead have sued for breach of the lease.

        Where the insurance carrier concedes both a duty to defend and a potential obligation to indemnify the insured, there is no legitimate purpose for rendering a declaratory judgment prior to the conclusion of the underlying tort action.

        In an insurerâs action seeking a declaration that the decedentsâ underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage did not apply to their accident and could not be stacked, as the insurer was not seeking to determine if it had any responsibility to defend or if the policies covered underinsured motorists, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rendering declaratory relief under N.D.C.C.

        In a suit brought by a condominium association against a pet owner for failing to comply with the associationâs pet restrictions, the trial court did not err in its judgment regarding the Federal Fair Housing Act, or the North Dakota Fair Housing Act, in which it found that pet owner did not have a valid claim for an accommodation under the Fair Housing Act and that it would not honor any future claim unless the pet ownerâs health changed significantly.
   Although pet owner claimed there was no justiciable controversy as to a claim for accommodation under the Fair Housing Act, the trial court found that there was a controversy since he had asserted a right to a housing act accommodation in his answer and, despite trying to remove it as an issue in the case, he tried to reserve the issue for future decision, by continuing to assert a right to make such a claim in the future. Riverside Park Condos. Unit Owners Ass'n v. Lucas, 2005 ND 26, 691 N.W.2d 862, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 26</cite> (N.D. 2005).

        The 1983 amendment to this section requires a trial court to render a declaratory judgment to determine both insurerâs coverage and duty to defend, whether or not the insuredâs liability has been determined.

        Summary judgment under N.D.R.Civ.P. 56 for an insurer was proper in the insurerâs declaratory action under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-23-06 to resolve business policy coverage where a house fell off of the support jack when the insured was replacing the foundation because the insured did not present evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the damages did not occur as a result of the insuredâs faulty workmanship, which was excluded in the policy. It was also proper as to coverage for non-payment to a subcontractor because the policy did not cover contract claims. Grinnell Mut. Reinsurance Co. v.

        Appeal was reviewable because the court's January 2014 order and subsequent consistent judgment were intended to be a final judgment on all proceedings relating to the lessors' action for declaratory relief; further, the January 2014 judgment dismissing lessee's counterclaim against the lessor also effectively dismissed the lessors' claim against the lessee's president.

        In a declaratory judgment action brought by an insurance company to determine coverage, it was not error to award the attorney fees and costs incurred by plaintiff in defending a declaratory judgment action brought by his insurer. If an insured is not awarded attorney fees as supplemental relief, he is effectively denied the benefit he bargained for in the insurance policy. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Sigman, 508 N.W.2d 323, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-23-08, an insured who prevailed in a declaratory relief action was entitled to reimbursement of its attorneysâ fees despite the absence of any finding of bad faith on the part of the insurer in its denial of coverage. The award is based upon the principle that insureds should be made whole, not on a desire to deter bad acts by insurers, which principle applies even if an insurer denies coverage in good faith, since even a good faith denial that leads to litigation forces the insured to spend money litigating the issue of coverage.

        Although the district courtâs determination that the statutory method for distributing funding for education, as a whole, is unconstitutional was sustained, the district court erred in mandating specific actions to be taken by the governor, the superintendent of public instruction, and the legislative assembly and its leaders, and in retaining jurisdiction to monitor and enforce compliance with its decision. The procedure for a declaratory judgment provides an adequate alternative to the courtâs retention of jurisdiction. Bismarck Pub. Sch. Dist. #1 v.

        In a suit brought by a condominium association against a pet owner for failing to comply with the associationâs pet restrictions, the trial court did not err in its judgment regarding the Federal Fair Housing Act, or the North Dakota Fair Housing Act, in which it found that pet owner did not have a valid claim for an accommodation under the Fair Housing Act and that it would not honor any future claim unless the pet ownerâs health changed significantly.
   Although pet owner claimed there was no justiciable controversy as to a claim for accommodation under the Fair Housing Act, the trial court found that there was a controversy since he had asserted a right to a housing act accommodation in his answer and, despite trying to remove it as an issue in the case, he tried to reserve the issue for future decision, by continuing to assert a right to make such a claim in the future.

       Whenever an insolvent debtor made a general disposition of all his property and effects, whether to all or only a part of his creditors, thereby abandoning his business or putting himself in such a situation that it was impossible for him to continue in it, he made a voluntary assignment.

       So long as the instrument employed by the debtor, whatever it be called, worked an absolute transfer of substantially all the property and effects of the insolvent from him to another or others with a design on his part that it should do so, and that his connection with the business should cease, it was a voluntary assignment on his part.

       When an individual files a petition for a name change, the court shall determine whether the petitioner has a criminal history in this state or any other state. The court may require the petitioner to submit to a statewide and nationwide criminal history record check. The criminal history record check must be conducted in the manner provided for in section 12-60-24. All costs associated with the criminal history record check are the responsibility of the petitioner. This subsection does not apply to a request for a name change as part of an application for a marriage license under section 14-03-20, to a request for a name change in conjunction with the annulment of a marriage under chapter 14-04 or the dissolution or separation of a marriage under chapter 14-05, or to the change of a minorâs name unless the court has reason to believe the request is being made to defraud or mislead, is not being made in good faith, will cause injury to an individual, or will compromise public safety. If the individual petitioning for a name change has a felony conviction under a law of this state or a law of another state or the federal government, the request is presumed to be made in bad faith, to defraud or mislead, to cause injury to an individual, or to compromise public safety. The name change may not be granted unless the individual requesting the name change proves by clear and convincing evidence that the request is not based upon an intent to defraud or mislead, is made in good faith, will not cause injury to an individual, and will not compromise public safety.

      <li id="t32c32-28s32-28-02ol13">
       The judge of the district court, upon being duly satisfied by affidavit or proof in open court of the truth of the allegations set forth in the petition, that there exists proper and reasonable cause for changing the name of the petitioner, and that thirty daysâ previous notice of the intended application has been given in the official newspaper of the county in which the petitioner resides, shall order a change of the name of the petitioner. Proper and reasonable cause does not exist if the court determines that the request for a name change is made to defraud or mislead, is not made in good faith, will cause injury to an individual, or will compromise public safety. The court may waive publication of the notice when the proposed change relates only to a first or given name as distinguished from a surname or upon evidence satisfactory to the court that the petitioner has been the victim of domestic violence as defined in section 14-07.1-01.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-28s32-28-02ol14">
       If the person whose name is to be changed is a minor, the court shall consider the appointment of a guardian ad litem, and notice of the intended application must be published in the official newspaper of the county in which the minor resides and, if different, the official newspaper of the county in which each of the minorâs parents reside. If the minor has a noncustodial parent, a copy of the notice must be deposited in a post office in this state, postage prepaid, not later than ten days after the publication of the notice, and directed to the noncustodial parentâs last reasonably ascertained post-office address. An affidavit of mailing of the notice prepared in accordance with the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure must be filed with the court.

        Although generally there should be some substantial reason to do so before the court denies a petition for change of name, that principle did not require it to permit a petitioner to change his name to â1069â, and it would not do so.

       <p>
        A trial court is vested with discretion in reviewing a petition for change of name. The statutory requirement âthat there exists proper and reasonable cause for changing the nameâ clearly vests the trial court with a great degree of judicial discretion. In re Mees, 465 N.W.2d 172, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        While the trial court is granted a great deal of judicial discretion in reviewing a petition for change of name, the discretion afforded to the trial court is not absolute. In re Mees, 465 N.W.2d 172, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        District court did not err in ordering the name change of the childâs surname as it would enhance his sense of belonging and security both at home and at school and prevent confusion and embarrassment to the child and promote a sense of family identity.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the motherâs petition to change the surname of her minor child to the motherâs new married name; the mother failed to establish proper and reasonable cause to change the name of the child, and if the mother divorced, the child would have to bear the surname of a man to whom she had no legal or biological relationship. Grad v. Jepson, 2002 ND 153, 652 N.W.2d 324, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        Because a father had failed to show that there was proper and reasonable cause for changing the last name of a child, N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-28-02, and there was no showing that the change would have been in the childâs best interests, the fatherâs petition to change the childâs last name was properly denied.

       <p>
        District court properly granted a mother's petition to change the surname of the parties' child because the district court did not err in including the father's request for paternity in its analysis of the child's best interest, the social stigma associated with the father's sex offence was relevant in the court's analysis of the child's best interests, the mother provided proper notice of the name-change petition, including physical publication in both counties and mailing notice to the father at the state penitentiary, and the district court allowed the father to appear at the name-change hearing telephonically or through ITV if he made all of the necessary arrangements himself.

       <p>
        A ânameâ generally, and at common law, consists of a Christian or given name and a patronymic or family name; it is a characterization in words used to distinguish one person from others; it was in this sense that the legislature used the word in the context of this section, and it did not intend that it should be possible to change oneâs name to a number; therefore, the court would deny petitionerâs request to change his name to â1069â.

       <p>
        While the general standard of review for name change petitions under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-28-02 remains the abuse-of-discretion standard, a district courtâs findings on the best interests of a child when deciding a petition to change the name of a minor child are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review under N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a).
   Berger v. Myhre, 2010 ND 28, 778 N.W.2d 579, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 31</cite> (In re Berger 2010).

        The district court must make findings sufficiently definitive so that on appeal reviewing court can determine whether or not the findings are arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable. In re Mees, 465 N.W.2d 172, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Requiring written findings delineating the reason(s) for denying a change of name petition is consistent with legislation which has expanded civil rights retained by convicts. In re Mees, 465 N.W.2d 172, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 1991).

      Whenever it may be desirable to change the name of any city in this state, a petition for that purpose may be filed in the district court of the county in which the city is situated, setting forth the reason for the change of name and the name requested. The court may order the change of name, on being satisfied by proof that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c32-28s32-28-03ol11">
       The request of the petitioners is just, proper, and reasonable.

       Notice has been provided as required in section 32-28-02.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-28s32-28-03ol13">
       Two-thirds of the qualified electors of the city, as determined by the vote cast for the office of governor at the last preceding gubernatorial election, have signed such petition expressing their desire that such change of name be granted.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-28s32-28-03ol14">
       There is no other city in this state with the requested name.

       Financial advisorâs motion to compel arbitration was improperly denied because the arbitration provision, which required arbitration of any controversy âarising out of or relating toâ any transaction with the brokerage firmâs agents or employees, was a broad provision which applied to the beneficiariesâ
   claims based primarily on the relationship between the financial advisor and the client and fell within the scope of the arbitration provision because the beneficiariesâ
   claims asserted a breach of an alleged duty the financial advisor owed to the client.

       Where the soybean seller failed to file a motion to vacate the arbitration award in favor of the soybean purchaser within 90 days of that award being entered, the soybean seller under N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-29.3-23(1)(a)-(f) waived any grounds for challenging the award. Pursuant to N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-29.3-23(2), the soybean seller was required to file a motion to vacate that award within 90 days, and that was true even where the soybean purchaser moved 70 days after the award to confirm it, as nothing in N.D.C.C. Â§ 32-29.3-22 regarding the confirmation of awards indicated that the filing of a motion to confirm tolled the 90-day time limit for filing a motion to vacate.

        Arbitrator did not act in a completely irrational manner in awarding arbitration in favor of an engineering company and against a contractor and the arbitration award was not so mistaken that it resulted in real injustice or constructive fraud nor did the arbitratorâs decision evidence a manifest disregard for the law. The arbitrator stated the correct law and applied it as he understood it and there was nothing in the record that evidenced the arbitrator knew the law and intentionally disregarded the law; even if the arbitrator had been mistaken as to the application of the law of collateral estoppel, it would not meet either standard to require vacation of the award.

     <p>
      When the action is against two or more defendants, the plaintiff may proceed as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t32c32-30s32-30-01ol11">
       If the action is against defendants jointly indebted upon contract and the summons is served on one or more, the plaintiff may proceed against the defendant served, unless the court otherwise directs, and if the plaintiff recovers judgment it may be entered against all the defendants thus jointly indebted to the extent only that it may be enforced against the joint property of all and the separate property of the defendants served, and, if they are subject to arrest, against the persons of the defendants served.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-30s32-30-01ol12">
       If the action is against defendants severally liable and one or more shall be served, the plaintiff may proceed against the defendants served in the same manner as if they were the only defendants.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-30s32-30-01ol13">
       If all the defendants have been served, judgment may be taken against any of them severally, when the plaintiff would be entitled to judgment against any one or more of such defendants if the action had been against such defendants or any of them alone.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-30s32-30-01ol14">
       If the name of one or more partners for any cause shall have been omitted in any action in which judgment shall have been entered against the defendants named in the summons, and such omission shall not have been pleaded in such action, the plaintiff, in case the judgment therein shall remain unsatisfied, may recover by action of such partner separately upon proving such partnerâs joint liability, notwithstanding that partner may not have been named in the original action, but the plaintiff shall have satisfaction of only one judgment rendered for the same claim for relief.

        In an action against several nonresident joint debtors to recover upon a joint contractual liability, the district court acquires provisional jurisdiction in personam over the joint debtor defendants by virtue of substituted service of the summons upon only one of the joint debtors.

        Where the district court acquires provisional jurisdiction in personam over nonresident joint debtor defendants by virtue of substituted service of the summons upon only one of the joint debtors in an action to recover upon a joint contractual liability, an attachment of their joint property serves to secure plaintiffâs claim and brings the property within the control of the court so that a default judgment in rem may be entered and enforced by execution sale of the joint property to the extent necessary to satisfy the joint liability in personam.

    Jurisdiction of district court in foreclosure of tax lien.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In any case in which the owner of real estate has been given notice of tax lien under chapter 57-20 for general taxes, for special assessments, for assessments of irrigation districts, for drain assessments, or for both general taxes and any such special taxes or assessments, the district court of the proper county shall have jurisdiction in an action in equity brought for that purpose to foreclose the lien of the delinquent taxes and assessments for which such land was noticed and to enter judgment foreclosing the same and decreeing that the same shall be sold under special execution in a manner similar to that prescribed in case of the foreclosure by action of a mortgage or other lien upon real property.
     </p>
     <p>
      If in such action it shall appear that the taxes or assessments are invalid or void by reason of noncompliance with the law, the court shall determine the true and just amount which the property attempted to be so assessed should pay to make the same uniform with other taxes and assessments for the same purpose, and judgment must be rendered and given against the property liable for such taxes or assessments without regard to the proceedings had for the levy thereof, and such judgment shall be a lien upon the property upon which the taxes or assessments shall have been levied, of equal force and effect as the lien of the tax or assessment, and the lien of such judgment shall be enforced by the court in such action.

      The ordinary procedure in an equity case shall apply to an action brought under the provisions of this chapter. The court shall include in its decree such provision as will permit such period of redemption from execution sale as may be necessary to give to those entitled to redeem at least as long a period of redemption as they would have had if the foreclosure of tax lien in question had been valid in all respects and tax deed thereunder had been applied for at the earliest date permitted under statutes with reference to procuring tax deeds under tax lien foreclosures. The remedy provided by this chapter shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies and shall not be held to impair or detract from any other remedy provided by any other statute or statutes.

      If the officer or other person whose duty it is to make a return dies, absconds, or moves from the state, or becomes insane after the writ is issued and before making a return, or after making an insufficient return, and it appears that there is no other officer or person from whom a sufficient return can be procured by means of a new writ, the court in its discretion may permit affidavits or other written proofs relative to the matters not sufficiently returned to be produced and may hear the case accordingly. The court also in its discretion may permit either party to produce affidavits or other written proofs relative to any alleged error of fact or any other question of fact which is essential to the jurisdiction of the body or officer to make the determination to be reviewed, when the facts in relation thereto are not stated sufficiently in the return and the court is satisfied that they cannot be made to appear by means of an order for a further return.

        Mandamus is available to compel an administrative agency to perform a ministerial duty which the law requires the agency to perform, but mandamus is not available to direct how, or in whose favor, the agency decides a case. Tooley v. Alm, 515 N.W.2d 137, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        Mandamus is not available if an appeal is authorized from an adverse decision of an administrative agency. Tooley v. Alm, 515 N.W.2d 137, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employeeâs petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the Director of the Office of Administrative Hearings to appoint an attorney to preside over the employeeâs hearing was properly denied; the employee could have raised the issue on appeal and therefore had a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law. Wutzke v. Hoberg, 2004 ND 42, 675 N.W.2d 179, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 54</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Agency may consult its attorney if there is a reasonable probability of some form of legal action, either litigation or an administrative proceeding; therefore, an employeeâs petition for a writ of mandamus was properly denied because a governing authority was not required to allow an open meeting under N.D.C.C.

        Landowner had a clear legal right to seek a writ of mandamus to compel township to install a culvert under a township road, and the lack of evidence at trial showing that the culvert would comply with scientific highway construction and engineering methods did not preclude the court from finding that the township had a clear legal duty to act. Kadlec v. Greendale Twp. Bd. of Twp. Supervisors, 1998 ND 165, 583 N.W.2d 817, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 1998), limited, Pembina County Water Res. Bd. v.

Red River Brick Corp. v. District Court, 24 N.D. 28, 138 N.W. 988, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1912).

       <p>
        Where an inferior court erroneously decides a jurisdictional question, or one preliminary to the main controversy submitted to it, adversely to its jurisdiction, and refuses to proceed further, the supreme court, by a writ of mandamus, may compel the inferior court to perform its duties. State ex rel. Heffron v. District Court, 26 N.D. 32, 143 N.W. 143, 1913 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1913).

        An inferior tribunal cannot be compelled to decide a question of fact in a particular way, though it may be compelled to take action and make some determination. Mogaard v. Garrison, 47 N.D. 468, 182 N.W. 758, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1921).

       </p>
       <p>
        Mandamus may be used to compel county commissioners to act where they have refused to act, but it may not be used to review the legality of a bid on the basis of which the commissioners have acted in awarding a contract. Bismarck Tribune Co. v. Wolf, 64 N.D. 656, 255 N.W. 569, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1934).

        District court properly dismissed a public employeeâs petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to compel a city to reinstate him after his termination because his due process rights were not violated in either the pre-termination or post-termination proceedings where he was represented by counsel during both hearings, admitted that he disobeyed a direct order of a supervisor by refusing to perform requested work, that he pushed the supervisor âpretty hard,â and the supervisor fell against a wall, was offered several opportunities to present a defense and to present evidence, was allowed to present witnesses to testify, to question those witnesses, and to submit documentary evidence.

        Education associationâs writ of mandamus was denied where it did not demonstrate a clear legal right to remove additional contract language regarding an identified teacher need, N.D.C.C. ch. 15-38.1, and there was no bad faith in the negotiations by the school district, N.D.C.C. Â§ 15.1-16-13; the school districtâs limited ability to contract separately was not contrary to N.D.C.C. ch. 15.1-16.

        Under the plain language of Rule GBRB-R, the teachers were fulfilling the 1,500-minute weekly teaching contact time they bargained for, and the partiesâ
   past course of dealing reflected a mutual understanding that the teachers were fulfilling their normal duties required under the rule; the district court did not err in rescinding its writ of mandamus, N.D.C.C.

        It was no abuse of discretion to require a school district to offer a teacherâs association a contract for one year, under the districtâs authority to unilaterally issue a last-offer contract on reaching an impasse, because limiting a this authority to a single school year then under negotiation was consistent with the purpose of letting a school district bring good-faith negotiations for an ensuing school year to an end to permit schools to operate.

        When there is no other adequate remedy and a threat of irreparable harm, a writ of prohibition may be sought to prohibit a hearing officer from enforcing an administrative discovery decision. Medical Arts Clinic, P.C. v. Franciscan Initiatives, 531 N.W.2d 289, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        The writ of prohibition is not a writ of right, but is available only when the inferior court, body, or tribunal is about to act without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction. Zinn v. District Court, 17 N.D. 128, 114 N.W. 475, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        The writ of prohibition issues only when the proceedings of a tribunal, corporation, board, or officer are without jurisdiction or in excess thereof. State ex rel. McDonald v. Hanley, 43 N.D. 388, 175 N.W. 569, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        A writ of prohibition is not a process for the correction of errors, and it lies only where there is no jurisdiction in the inferior court or body, or when such court or body is about to act in excess of jurisdiction. Lynch v. District Court, 48 N.D. 431, 185 N.W. 303, 1921 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition lies against a judge acting without jurisdiction, even though the court itself has jurisdiction of the defendant and of the charge against him. State ex rel. Lucia v. Monson, 55 N.D. 892, 215 N.W. 680, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of prohibition is to be used sparingly and only in cases where there is an inadequate remedy by appeal or other equitable considerations require its use. Davis v. O'Keefe, 283 N.W.2d 73, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 276</cite> (N.D. 1979).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a district court enjoins proceedings by a board of drainage commissioners acting regularly and within its exclusive jurisdiction, a writ of prohibition from the supreme court is a proper remedy to be invoked against further proceedings by the district court. State ex rel. Dorgan v. Fisk, 15 N.D. 219, 107 N.W. 191, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        The writ of prohibition is the proper remedy where the tax commission is acting outside its jurisdiction. State ex rel. Linde v. Packard, 32 N.D. 301, 155 N.W. 666, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        A writ of prohibition under the general and supervisory jurisdiction of the supreme court is the appropriate means that it may employ to arrest and control proceedings of district court in the issue of its injunctional orders. State ex rel. Shafer v. Lowe, 54 N.D. 637, 210 N.W. 501, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1926), overruled in part, Bulman v. Hulstrand Constr.

       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of prohibition was not a proper remedy where the district court, by issuing an ex parte order, had completed the act for which petitioner had sought the writ; however, fact that writ of prohibition was not a proper remedy did not prevent Supreme Court from granting appropriate relief. Beck v. Smith, 296 N.W.2d 886, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 280</cite> (N.D. 1980).

        Prohibition was not proper remedy to test power of public service commission to issue temporary certificate of convenience and necessity without hearing where certificate had already been issued; prohibition is not appropriate writ to revoke order already made since proper use is to prohibit doing of something, not undoing of something already done.

       </p>
       <p>
        The writ of prohibition issues only when the proceedings of a tribunal, corporation, board, or officer are without jurisdiction or in excess thereof. State ex rel. McDonald v. Hanley, 43 N.D. 388, 175 N.W. 569, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1919).

       <p>
        A writ of prohibition is not a process for the correction of errors, and it lies only where there is no jurisdiction in the inferior court or body, or when such court or body is about to act in excess of jurisdiction.

        Application for a writ of prohibition is an appropriate method of attacking the constitutionality of a statute and can provide a convenient way of reaching the constitutional question without the expense and delay of a full trial.

        Taxpayer was a person âbeneficially interestedâ in the subject of litigation, and was entitled to petition for a writ of prohibition in an action to bar the director of accounts and purchases from making unvouchered quarterly expense payments to certain elected officials as provided for in S.L. 1975, ch. 25, subd. 17.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Petition in supreme court for an original writ of prohibition against the public service commission to prohibit the commission from carrying into effect a certain order claimed to affect substantial rights of the relators was denied where relators were private corporations and no right of the public was involved. State ex rel. Amerada Petro. Corp. v. North Dakota Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 79 N.W.2d 297 (N.D. 1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition was not proper remedy to test power of public service commission to issue temporary certificate of convenience and necessity without hearing where certificate had already been issued; prohibition is not appropriate writ to revoke order already made since proper use is to prohibit doing of something, not undoing of something already done.

        Before the supreme court will conclude that the lower court erred in refusing to issue a writ of prohibition, an appellant must affirmatively establish that there was an abuse of discretion, i.e., that the lower court acted in an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable manner.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The denial of a writ of prohibition restraining enforcement of a statute or ordinance would be unreasonable where there is no adequate alternative and the statute or ordinance is flagrantly and patently violative of express constitutional prohibitions. But where nonfrivolous arguments can be made to support the constitutionality of the enactment, it could not be said that the lower courtâs refusal to issue the writ was unreasonable. Schneider v. Seaworth, 376 N.W.2d 49, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 461</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, if two or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property or for the same wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among them even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-38s32-38-01ol12">
       The right of contribution exists only in favor of a tort-feasor who has paid more than that tort-feasorâs pro rata share of the common liability, and that tort-feasorâs total recovery is limited to the amount paid by that tort-feasor in excess of that tort-feasorâs pro rata share. No tort-feasor is compelled to make contribution beyond that tort-feasorâs own pro rata share of the entire liability.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-38s32-38-01ol13">
       There is no right of contribution in favor of any tort-feasor who has intentionally (willfully or wantonly) caused or contributed to the injury or wrongful death.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-38s32-38-01ol14">
       A tort-feasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant is not entitled to recover contribution from another tort-feasor whose liability for the injury or wrongful death is not extinguished by the settlement nor in respect to any amount paid in a settlement which is in excess of what was reasonable.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-38s32-38-01ol15">
       A liability insurer, who by payment has discharged in full or in part the liability of a tort-feasor and has thereby discharged in full its obligation as insurer, is subrogated to the tort-feasorâs right of contribution to the extent of the amount it has paid in excess of the tort-feasorâs pro rata share of the common liability. This provision does not limit or impair any right of subrogation arising from any other relationship.
      </li>
      <li id="t32c32-38s32-38-01ol16">
       This chapter does not impair any right or indemnity under existing law. If one tort-feasor is entitled to indemnity from another, the right of the indemnity obligee is for indemnity and not contribution, and the indemnity obligor is not entitled to contribution from the obligee for any portion of the obligorâs indemnity obligation.

        A tort-feasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant is not entitled to recover contribution from another tort-feasor whose liability for the injury or wrongful death is not extinguished by the settlement nor in respect to any amount paid in a settlement which is in excess of what was reasonable; therefore, because there was no evidence that the third party defendantâs liability was extinguished by the defendantâs settlement with the plaintiffs, the defendant was not entitled to maintain an action for contribution against the third party defendant. Pierce v. Shannon, 2000 ND 54, 607 N.W.2d 878, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 47</cite> (N.D. 2000).

        Nothing within this chapter restricts its application to situations in which parties act in concert or jointly; statute applies when parties become jointly or severally liable in tort for same indivisible injury, even if one party becomes liable as result of maintaining a nuisance which may be either with or without negligence. Thorson v. City of Minot, 153 N.W.2d 764 (N.D. 1967), decided prior to the enactment of N.D.C.C. Â§Â§ 32-03.2-02 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t32c32-03.2s32-03.2-03" target="_self">32-03.2-03</a></cite>.

        A claim for contribution is a separate and distinct action from the underlying tort.

     <p>
      Upon final voluntary compromise settlement of any claim, including a claim of medical malpractice, against any person based on alleged liability of that person for injury or damage arising out of any occurrence, the parties may make any agreement they desire concerning previous voluntary services or partial payments of the claim. If the claim is tried in a court, after entry of judgment involving the claim, the value of any previous voluntary service or partial payment of the claim must be deducted from the amount of the judgment if the value thereof was included in the assessment of damages contained in the judgment. If, after entry of judgment involving the claim, it is determined by the judgment that the amount of injury or damages is less than the value of the previous services and voluntary payments, the provider of the services or payer of the payments has no claim for relief for the recovery of amounts by which the voluntary services or payments exceed the final court judgment.

      The effect of this chapter may be varied by agreement of the parties made before or after commencement of an action or distribution proceeding or the entry of judgment. Parties to a transaction may agree upon the money to be used in a transaction giving rise to a foreign-money claim and may agree to use different moneys for different aspects of the transaction. Stating the price in a foreign money for one aspect of a transaction does not alone require the use of that money for other aspects of the transaction.

       A monetary claim is neither usurious nor unconscionable because the agreement on which it is based provides that the amount of the debtorâs obligation to be paid in the debtorâs money, when received by the creditor, must equal a specified amount of the foreign money of the country of the creditor. If, because of unexcused delay in payment of a judgment or award, the amount received by the creditor does not equal the amount of the foreign money specified in the agreement, the court or arbitrator shall amend the judgment or award accordingly.

        Damage cap in the statute does not violate the equal-protection provisions of N.D. Const. art. I, Â§ 21 and is not unconstitutional; the statute does not prevent seriously injured individuals from being fully compensated for any amount of medical care or lost wages, but instead, injured individuals are prevented from receiving more abstract damages in excess of $ 500,000. Condon v. St. Alexius Med. Ctr., 2019 ND 113, 926 N.W.2d 136, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in denying a doctorâs motion for a reduction of noneconomic damages on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional because there was a close correspondence between the damage cap at issue in the case and legitimate legislative goals to satisfy the intermediate level of scrutiny under N.D. Const. art. I, Â§ 21; the statute is supported by the general goals of the health care task force and testimony suggesting benefits to insurance rates may result from the cap. Condon v.

      A person who willfully or purposefully disseminates a false and defamatory statement, knowing the statement to be false, regarding an agricultural producer or an agricultural product under circumstances in which the statement may be reasonably expected to be believed and the agricultural producer is damaged as a result, is liable to the agricultural producer for damages and other relief allowed by law in a court of competent jurisdiction, including injunctive relief and compensatory and exemplary damages. If it is found by a court or jury that a person has maliciously disseminated a false and defamatory statement regarding an agricultural product or agricultural producer, the agricultural producer may recover up to three times the actual damages proven and the court must order that the agricultural producer recover costs, disbursements, and actual reasonable attorneyâs fees incurred in the action.
