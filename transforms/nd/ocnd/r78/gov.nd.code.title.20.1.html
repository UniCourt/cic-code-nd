    Ownership and control of wildlife is in the state — Damages — Schedule of monetary values — Civil penalty.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The ownership of and title to all wildlife within this state is in the state for the purpose of regulating the enjoyment, use, possession, disposition, and conservation thereof, and for maintaining action for damages as herein provided. Any person catching, killing, taking, trapping, or possessing any wildlife protected by law at any time or in any manner is deemed to have consented that the title thereto remains in this state for the purpose of regulating the taking, use, possession, and disposition thereof. The state, through the office of attorney general, may institute and maintain any action for damages against any person who unlawfully causes, or has caused within this state, the death, destruction, or injury of wildlife, except as may be authorized by law. The state has a property interest in all protected wildlife. This interest supports a civil action for damages for the unlawful destruction of wildlife by willful or grossly negligent act or omission. The director shall adopt by rule a schedule of monetary values of various species of wildlife, the values to represent the replacement costs of the wildlife and the value lost to the state due to the destruction or injury of the species, together with other material elements of value. In any action brought under this section, the schedule constitutes the measure of recovery for the wildlife killed or destroyed. Notwithstanding the director’s schedule of monetary values, an individual who unlawfully takes a bighorn sheep, elk, or moose is subject to a civil penalty for the replacement value of the animal of five thousand dollars for a bighorn sheep, three thousand dollars for an elk, and two thousand dollars for a moose. For a male bighorn sheep, elk, or moose over two and one-half years of age, the civil penalty for the replacement value of the animal is an additional fifty percent of the penalty. The funds recovered must be deposited in the general fund, and devoted to the propagation and protection of desirable species of wildlife.

        Although the repealed Game, Fish, and Predators title provides that the ownership of fish, while they are in a state of freedom, is in the state for the purposes of regulation of their taking and conservation, the interest of the state in fish running wild in the streams of the state is that of a sovereign, and not that of an owner.

      Except as provided in subsection 10 of section 20.1-02-05 and as otherwise provided in this section, a person, other than the landowner, without the written permission of the landowner or a lessee who actively farms or ranches that land, while hunting big game or small game, other than waterfowl or cranes, statewide, may not use a motor-driven vehicle on any land other than an established road or trail, unless that person has reduced a big game animal to possession and cannot easily retrieve the big game animal, in which case a motor-driven vehicle may be used to retrieve the big game animal, but after retrieval, the motor-driven vehicle must be returned to the established road or trail along the same route it originally departed. A person may not use a motor-driven vehicle on any land other than an established road or trail to hunt upland game during the deer gun season. For purposes of safety and allowing normal travel, a motor-driven vehicle may be parked on the roadside or directly adjacent to said road or trail. No person, while hunting big game or small game, statewide, may drive or attempt to drive, run or attempt to run, molest or attempt to molest, flush or attempt to flush, or harass or attempt to harass any such game with the use or aid of any motor-driven vehicle. A person, other than the landowner, without the written permission of the landowner or a lessee who actively farms or ranches that land, while hunting big game or small game, other than waterfowl or cranes, statewide, may not drive through any retired cropland, brush area, slough area, timber area, open prairie, or unharvested or harvested cropland, except upon an established road or trail. The provisions of this section relating to hunting big game or small game while using a motor-driven vehicle on any land other than an established road or trail without the written permission of the landowner or a lessee who actually farms or ranches that land do not apply to the hunting of big game during an open and lawful season for small game.

    Suspension of hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges — Surrender and return of license.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the penalty provided upon conviction under this title, the court may suspend the defendant’s hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges for up to three years; however, if the defendant is convicted of an offense under section 20.1-01-33, the court may suspend the defendant’s hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges for up to the life of the defendant but not less than five years. The court may not suspend the defendant’s privileges for a noncriminal violation if the defendant has not been convicted for a violation of this title in the last three years. Upon conviction for a violation of section 20.1-01-18, the court shall suspend the defendant’s hunting, fishing, and trapping privileges for a period of at least one year, two years for the second conviction, and three years for the third or subsequent conviction. At the time of the suspension, the court shall determine whether the defendant must successfully complete the hunter education course provided for in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t20.1c20.1-03s20.1-03-01" target="_self">20.1-03-01</a></cite>.1, as prescribed by the proper state or provincial natural resources or wildlife management agency, before the defendant may purchase a new or obtain the return of a valid hunting license.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon imposition of the suspension, the court shall take any hunting, trapping, or fishing license or permit held by the defendant and forward it, together with a certified copy of the suspension order, to the director. Except as otherwise provided in this section, upon expiration of the suspension, the director shall return the person’s license or permit if it is still valid. No person may purchase, or attempt to purchase, a hunting, trapping, or fishing license or permit during a suspension period. If the court so ordered, no person who has had a hunting license suspended may purchase or attempt to purchase a hunting license nor may the director return a valid hunting license until the person has successfully completed the course provided for in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t20.1c20.1-03s20.1-03-01" target="_self">20.1-03-01</a></cite>.1 and as prescribed by the proper state or provincial natural resources or wildlife management agency. A certificate of completion for a similar course issued by any other state or province of Canada is sufficient to meet this requirement. The person shall file proof of that completion with the court.

     <p>
      For the purpose of this section, the term “conviction” includes an admission or adjudication of a noncriminal violation.

       Violation of this section is a class C felony and, in addition to other penalties imposed by law, is subject to section 20.1-01-26. The defendant being over a daily or possession limit of fish, small game, or waterfowl is not sufficient as a predicate offense for a conviction under subdivision b or c of subsection 1 unless the state proves that the conduct occurred over more than three days or the person takes or possesses more than four times a daily limit and the state alleges and proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the minimum number of predicate offenses required were committed intentionally. Except for a charge under subdivision d of subsection 1, the state may not charge an individual for both the predicate offense and a charge under this section. A conviction from another state or a federal court for an offense similar to one prescribed in title 20.1 may be used as a conviction under this section.

The department shall establish a prorated repayment system over a three-year period. For winter management program purposes of this section, a person may not willfully hunt, harass, chase, pursue, take, attempt to take, possess, transport, ship, convey by common carrier, sell, barter, or exchange a deer except as provided in carrying out practices to alleviate depredations under the private land habitat and access improvement program and elsewhere in this title.

      Upon request, the director may appoint the person making the request an agent to distribute hunting and fishing licenses. The director may provide licenses to agents located outside this state if there are no agents located a reasonable distance within this state where nonresidents may obtain licenses. Upon request, the director may appoint the county auditor of any county as an agent to distribute hunting and fishing licenses. The director may require an agent to show evidence of adequate financial security before the agent is appointed. Adequate financial security may be evidenced by a letter of credit, cash deposit, or bond. Agents may be bonded through the state bonding fund. An agent may charge a purchaser up to three percent of the total license fee excluding the certificate fee. The agent shall return the remainder of the license fees to the director at least once each month. Notwithstanding section 26.1-21-11, if a claim against the state bonding fund is not filed within sixty days of the expiration of the reporting period provided in this section, the claim is waived. Deposits are to be accompanied by a report showing the amounts received from the sale of each type of license, the amount retained, and the net amounts deposited. The director shall deposit all license fees received with the state treasurer to be credited to the game and fish fund. Each agent appointed to distribute hunting and fishing licenses shall implement a computerized online licensing system approved by the department. The agent is responsible for any equipment, supplies, and technical support associated with selling licenses online.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any person providing guide or outfitter services without a license, or while under suspension, revocation, or denial is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. The court must suspend an individual’s hunting, trapping, and fishing privileges for at least one year under section 20.1-01-26 if an individual provided guide or outfitter services without a license, or while under suspension, revocation, or denial, or guided on prohibited lands. Unless otherwise specified, other violations of this chapter are a class B misdemeanor. Each client guided is subject to separate and distinct offenses. In addition to this penalty, the director may initiate civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction as necessary to enforce this chapter or any rule adopted under this chapter, including an injunction to restrain a violation, without proof of actual damages sustained by any person. Any individual who commits for remuneration or compensation an act of fraud involving hunting or fishing or any individual who illegally takes or causes death to fish or wildlife for remuneration or compensation may be prosecuted for theft, fraud, or conspiracy under title 12.1 and is, upon conviction, liable for the higher amount between the actual compensation received or the value of the fish or wildlife illegally taken or killed.

      If the director determines by clear and convincing evidence that a substantial violation of state or federal criminal hunting, fishing, or trapping laws of this chapter by a guide or outfitter has occurred, the director may suspend, revoke, or deny a guide or outfitter license to the person violating the laws or provisions. In such a case, a hearing must be held within ten days of the director’s intended action and the person must be given notice of the hearing. The person may waive the hearing after having been notified of the person’s right to a hearing, in which case the action of the director takes effect upon signing the waiver. The director may serve notice of the hearing by publication if reasonable efforts to make personal service have failed.

      A person may not act as a hunting guide or hunting outfitter on land the person knows is owned by the state unless the appropriate state agency permits or authorizes the guiding or outfitting, on private land enrolled by the department for purposes of hunting, on land in which the department pays in lieu of taxes, on federal lands without being authorized or permitted as required by the appropriate federal agency, or on private lands posted against hunting or trespassing without first informing and obtaining permission from the landowner to conduct guiding or outfitting on the land. If the landowner did not grant the permission in writing, there is a presumption that the permission did not exist.

No license is required of any person for taking fish by angling at a licensed private fish hatchery operated in accordance with the rules of the director. The hatchery operator shall furnish to each person taking fish a written certificate in the form the director prescribes, giving the number and description of the fish taken and other information as the director requires, whereupon the fish may be possessed, shipped, or transported within the state in like manner as fish taken by residents under a license. The director shall issue an annual license to operate the hatchery during a calendar year or a portion of a year upon application and payment of the appropriate fee by the owner or operator. The license may be suspended for noncompliance with the director’s regulations.

        Defendant did not have standing to argue the tagging requirement of the Governor’s deer hunting proclamation was unconstitutionally vague where defendant did not tag the deer before he transported it to his house or before he began cutting it up on his driveway; under the circumstances of the case, a reasonable person would know defendant’s conduct violated the tagging requirement.

    Governor’s proclamation concerning the hunting of bighorn sheep — Certain license recipients not eligible to apply again.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The governor may by proclamation provide for a season to hunt bighorn sheep in the manner, number, places, and times as the governor prescribes. Licenses to hunt bighorn sheep must be issued by lottery, except special allocation licenses issued under subsection 1 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t20.1c20.1-05.1s20.1-05.1-01" target="_self">20.1-05.1-01</a></cite>. Upon payment of the nonrefundable application fee required by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t20.1c20.1-03s20.1-03-12" target="_self">20.1-03-12</a></cite>.2, a nonresident may participate in the state lottery. One license to hunt bighorn sheep may be issued to a nonresident participating in the state lottery. If a nonresident is issued a license to hunt bighorn sheep, no other nonresident may be issued a license to hunt bighorn sheep through the state lottery. If all of the licenses to hunt bighorn sheep made available through the state lottery are issued to residents, then a nonresident is not eligible to be issued a license to hunt bighorn sheep through the state lottery. Individuals who receive a license through the raffle or auction may not transfer the license.

    Property unlawfully taken, transported, or used to be confiscated by certain game and fish officials — Procedure.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The director, deputy director, or any bonded game warden shall seize all wild birds, wild animals, or fish, or any part thereof, taken, killed, or possessed, or transported contrary to law, and shall seize all dogs, guns, seines, nets, boats, lights, automobiles, vehicles, instrumentalities, appliances, and devices unlawfully used, or held with intent to be unlawfully used, in pursuing, taking, or attempting to take, concealing, or disposing of wild birds, wild animals, or fish, or any part thereof. Property used or held with the intent to be used unlawfully in pursuing, taking, attempting to take, concealing, or disposing of wild birds, wild animals, or fish may not be confiscated when the violation is a noncriminal offense. All property seized must be held subject to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. When property is confiscated, the confiscating officer shall bring the alleged offender before a court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of determining disposition. However, if the court having nominal jurisdiction over the alleged wrongdoer determines that the value of the confiscated property exceeds the court’s jurisdictional limitations, the matter may, upon the motion of either party, be removed to district court for determination. If the alleged offender desires an attorney, a reasonable time must be given to secure counsel. If it is not feasible to bring the alleged offender immediately before the court, the property may not be seized or confiscated if the alleged offender gives a receipt to the officer assuring delivery before the court when the matter comes up. The receipt must contain the provisions of this section to advise the alleged offender of the law.

The application must be made by the applicant, the applicant’s agent, or the applicant’s attorney; must be in the form the director prescribes; and must be accompanied by the appropriate operating permit fee. Acreage [hectarage] amounts must include lands used for hatching, game production areas, or headquarters areas. Upon the receipt of the application, the director shall inspect the area described therein, including the facilities, and shall investigate the ability of the applicant to operate an area of this character, in accordance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t20.1c20.1-12s20.1-12-03" target="_self">20.1-12-03</a></cite>.

At no time following release may a shooting preserve operator allow the number of wild and released birds harvested to exceed one hundred percent of the number of birds that have been released. All birds must be healthy when released. The total percent of harvested wild birds kept by clients may not exceed twenty-five percent of the birds harvested during the season. Other than those wild birds allowed to be retained by a client, the shooting preserve operator shall deliver to the department all wild birds harvested.

      The owner of a vessel is liable for any injury or damage occasioned by the negligent operation of such vessel, whether such negligence consists of a violation of state statutes, or neglecting to observe such ordinary care and such operation as the rules of the common law require. The owner is not liable, however, unless such vessel is being used with the owner’s express or implied consent. It must be presumed that such vessel is being operated with the knowledge and consent of the owner, if at the time of the injury or damage it is under the control of the owner’s spouse, father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, or other immediate member of the owner’s family. Nothing herein relieves any other person from any liability that person would otherwise have, and nothing contained herein authorizes or permits any recovery in excess of injury or damage actually incurred.

    Implied consent to determine alcohol concentration and presence of drugs.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any individual who operates a motorboat or vessel in this state is deemed to have given consent, and shall consent, subject to this chapter, to a chemical test, or tests, of the blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, or urine. As used in this chapter, “operates” means to be in motion, en route, but not at anchor or aground; “vessel” means any watercraft used or designed to be used for navigation on the water such as a boat operated by machinery, either permanently or temporarily affixed, a sailboat other than a sailboard, an inflatable manually propelled boat, a canoe, kayak, or rowboat, but does not include an inner tube, air mattress, or other water toy; “drug” means any drug or substance or combination of drugs or substances which renders an individual incapable of safely operating a motorboat or vessel; and “chemical test” means any test or tests to determine the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, or urine, approved by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee under this chapter. The chemical test must be administered at the direction of a game warden or a law enforcement officer only after placing the individual, except individuals mentioned in section 20.1-13.1-04, under arrest and informing that individual that the individual is or will be charged with the offense of operating a motorboat or vessel while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or a combination thereof. For the purposes of this chapter, the taking into custody of a minor under section 27-20.4-05 satisfies the requirement of an arrest. The game warden or law enforcement officer shall also inform the individual charged that refusal of the individual to submit to the chemical test determined appropriate will result in that individual being prohibited from operating a motorboat or vessel for up to three years. The game warden or law enforcement officer shall determine the chemical test to be used. When a minor is taken into custody for violating section 20.1-13-07, the game warden or law enforcement officer shall diligently attempt to contact the minor’s parent or legal guardian to explain the cause for the custody and the implied consent chemical testing requirements. Neither the game warden or law enforcement officer’s efforts to contact, nor any consultation with, a parent or legal guardian may be permitted to interfere with the administration of chemical testing requirements under this chapter.

      Only an individual medically qualified to draw blood, acting at the request of a game warden or a law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood. The director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee shall determine the qualifications or credentials for being medically qualified to draw blood and shall issue a list of approved designations, including medical doctor and registered nurse. This limitation does not apply to the taking of a breath or urine specimen. The director of the state crime laboratory, or the director’s designee, shall electronically post a copy of the certified list of approved designations, including medical doctor and registered nurse, with the state crime laboratory division of the attorney general at the attorney general website and shall make the certified records required by this section available for download in a printable format on the attorney general website. The individual tested may have an individual of that individual’s own choosing, who is medically qualified to draw blood, administer a chemical test in addition to any administered at the direction of a game warden or a law enforcement officer with all costs of the additional chemical test to be the responsibility of the individual charged. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by an individual does not preclude the admission of the chemical test taken at the direction of a game warden or a law enforcement officer. Upon the request of the individual who is tested, a copy of the operational checklist and test record of a breath sample test or analytical report of a blood or urine sample test taken at the direction of the game warden or law enforcement officer must be made available to that individual by the department or law enforcement agency that administered the chemical test.

On that notification, that game warden or law enforcement agency shall immediately issue a statement of intent to prohibit the individual from operating a motorboat or vessel. The issuance of a statement of intent to prohibit the individual from operating a motorboat or vessel serves as the director’s official notification to the individual of the director’s intent to prohibit the individual from operating a motorboat or vessel in this state.

      Any person who has been prohibited from operating a motorboat or vessel by the decision of the hearing officer under section 20.1-13.1-08 may appeal within seven days after the date the hearing officer issued the decision under section 20.1-13.1-08 as shown by the date of the hearing officer’s decision, notwithstanding section 28-32-42, by serving on the director and filing a notice of appeal and specifications of error in the district court in the county where the events occurred for which the demand for a chemical test was made or in the county in which the administrative hearing was held. The court shall set the matter for hearing, and the petitioner shall give twenty days’ notice of the hearing to the director and to the hearing officer who rendered the decision. Neither the director nor the court may stay the decision pending decision on appeal. Within fifteen days after receipt of the notice of appeal, the director or the hearing officer who rendered the decision shall file in the office of the clerk of court to which the appeal is taken a certified transcript of the testimony and all other proceedings. This record is the record on which the appeal must be determined. No additional evidence may be heard. The court shall affirm the decision of the director or hearing officer unless it finds the evidence insufficient to warrant the conclusion reached by the director or hearing officer.

    Implied consent to determine alcohol concentration and presence of drugs.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any individual who is afield with a gun or other firearm or a bow and arrow is deemed to have given consent, and shall consent, subject to this chapter, to a chemical test of the blood, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, or urine. As used in this chapter, “drug” means any drug or substance or combination of drugs or substances which renders an individual incapable of safely hunting or being afield with a gun or other firearm or a bow and arrow, and “chemical test” means any test or tests to determine the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood, breath, or urine, approved by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee under this chapter. The chemical test must be administered at the direction of a game warden or a law enforcement officer only after placing the individual, except individuals mentioned in section 20.1-15-04, under arrest and informing that individual that the individual is or will be charged with the offense of being afield with a gun or other firearm or a bow and arrow while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, drugs, or a combination thereof. For the purposes of this chapter, the taking into custody of a minor under section 27-20.4-05 satisfies the requirement of an arrest. The game warden or law enforcement officer shall also inform the individual charged that refusal of the individual to submit to the chemical test determined appropriate will result in a revocation for up to four years of the individual’s hunting privileges. The game warden or law enforcement officer shall determine the chemical test to be used. When a minor is taken into custody for violating section 20.1-01-06, the game warden or law enforcement officer shall diligently attempt to contact the minor’s parent or legal guardian to explain the cause for the custody and the implied consent chemical testing requirements. Neither the game warden or law enforcement officer’s efforts to contact, nor any consultation with, a parent or legal guardian may be permitted to interfere with the administration of chemical testing requirements under this chapter.

      Notwithstanding section 20.1-15-01 or 20.1-15-06, when a hunter is involved in an accident resulting in the death or serious bodily injury, as defined in section 12.1-01-04, of another person, and there is probable cause to believe that the hunter is in violation of section 20.1-01-06, the hunter may be compelled by a game warden or a police officer to submit to a chemical test.

     <p>
      Only an individual medically qualified to draw blood, acting at the request of a game warden or a law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or presence of other drugs, or combination thereof, in the individual’s blood. The director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee shall determine the qualifications or credentials for being medically qualified to draw blood and shall issue a list of approved designations, including medical doctor and registered nurse. This limitation does not apply to the taking of a breath or urine specimen. The director of the state crime laboratory, or the director’s designee, shall electronically post a copy of the certified list of approved designations, including medical doctor and registered nurse, with the state crime laboratory division of the attorney general at the attorney general website and shall make the certified records required by this section available for download in a printable format on the attorney general website. The individual tested may have an individual of that individual’s own choosing, who is medically qualified to draw blood, administer a chemical test in addition to any administered at the direction of a game warden or a law enforcement officer with all costs of the additional chemical test to be the responsibility of the individual charged. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by an individual does not preclude the admission of the chemical test taken at the direction of a game warden or a law enforcement officer. Upon the request of the individual who is tested, a copy of the operational checklist and test record of a breath sample test or analytical report of a blood or urine sample test taken at the direction of the game warden or law enforcement officer must be made available to that individual by the department or law enforcement agency that administered the chemical test.

       Before issuing an order of suspension, revocation, or denial under section 20.1-15-06 or 20.1-15-07, the director shall afford that person an opportunity for a hearing if the person mails a request for the hearing to the director within ten days after the date the game warden or law enforcement officer issued a statement of intent to revoke, suspend, or deny hunting privileges and took possession of that person’s hunting license. The hearing must be held within twenty-five days after the date the game warden or law enforcement officer issued a statement of intent to revoke, suspend, or deny hunting privileges and took possession of that person’s hunting license, but the hearing officer may extend the hearing to within thirty-five days after the date the game warden or law enforcement officer issued a statement of intent to revoke, suspend, or deny hunting privileges and took possession of that person’s hunting license if good cause is shown.

The hearing must be recorded and its scope may cover only the issues of whether the arresting warden or officer had reasonable grounds to believe the individual had been afield with a gun or other firearm or bow and arrow in violation of section 20.1-01-06; whether the individual was placed under arrest; whether the individual was tested in accordance with section 20.1-15-01 or 20.1-15-04 and, if applicable, section 20.1-15-03; and whether the chemical test results show the individual had an alcohol, other drug, or a combination thereof concentration of at least ten one-hundredths of one percent by weight. For purposes of this section, a copy of a certified copy of an analytical report of a blood or urine sample from the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee, or a certified copy of the checklist and test records from a certified breath test operator establish prima facie the alcohol, other drug, or a combination thereof concentration shown therein.

    Screening tests.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any individual who is afield with a gun or other firearm or a bow and arrow is deemed to have given consent to submit to an onsite screening test of the individual’s breath for the purpose of estimating the alcohol concentration in the individual’s breath upon the request of a game warden or a law enforcement officer who has reason to believe and has, through the officer’s observations, formulated an opinion that the individual’s body contains alcohol. An individual may not be required to submit to a screening test of breath while at a hospital as a patient if the medical practitioner in immediate charge of the individual’s case is not first notified of the proposal to make the requirement or objects to the test on the ground that such would be prejudicial to the proper care or treatment of the patient. The screening test must be performed by a game warden or an enforcement officer certified as a chemical test operator by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee and according to methods and with devices approved by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee. The results of the screening test must be used only for determining whether a further test is to be given under the provisions of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t20.1c20.1-15s20.1-15-01" target="_self">20.1-15-01</a></cite>. The officer shall inform the individual that refusal of the individual to submit to a screening test will result in a revocation for up to four years of that individual’s hunting privileges. If the individual refuses to submit to the screening test, none may be given, but the refusal is sufficient cause to revoke the individual’s hunting privileges in the same manner as provided in section 20.1-15-06, and a hearing as provided in section 20.1-15-08 and a judicial review as provided in section 20.1-15-09 must be available. However, the director may not revoke an individual’s hunting privileges for refusing to submit to a screening test requested under this section if the individual provides a sufficient breath, blood, or urine sample for a chemical test requested under section 20.1-15-01 for the same incident. This section does not supersede any provisions of sections 20.1-15-01 through 20.1-15-14, nor does any provision of sections 20.1-15-01 through 20.1-15-14 supersede this section except as provided herein. For the purposes of this section, “chemical test operator” means an individual certified by the director of the state crime laboratory or the director’s designee as qualified to perform analysis for alcohol, other drugs, or a combination thereof in an individual’s blood, breath, or urine.
