        Municipal Courts.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Although municipal courts are not courts of record, they nevertheless appear subject to the requirements of N.D.R.Crim.P., Rule 11(f). City of Fargo v. Christiansen, 430 N.W.2d 327, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court of North Dakota held that post-conviction relief under N.D.C.C. ch. 29-32.1 was not available in municipal courts in North Dakota, because municipal courts were not courts of record under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-01s27-01-01" target="_self">27-01-01</a></cite>. If an appeal from municipal court directly to the Supreme Court was proper, review would be impossible because of the lack of a record; therefore, the municipal court judgment denying petitioner’s application for post-conviction relief was void.

      The state court administrator shall submit a comprehensive budget for the supreme court and the district courts to the legislative assembly.

The budget for the district courts must include all salary and expenses for the district courts, including the juvenile courts, and their employees. Each county shall provide the district court in that county with adequate chamber, court, and law library quarters, and lights and fuel and appropriate facilities for clerk of court services that are state-funded pursuant to section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-05.2s27-05.2-02" target="_self">27-05.2-02</a></cite>. Any equipment, furnishings, and law libraries in the control and custody of the district court on January 1, 1980, and any such property acquired from that date until July 1, 1981, must continue to be in the district court’s custody and control until the state court administrator determines such items are no longer needed by the court.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Indigency is the threshold for the granting of leave to proceed in forma pauperis. Yet, even if indigency is alleged sufficiently, the trial court still has discretion to deny a petition according to the language of this section. Patten v. Green, 369 N.W.2d 105, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 335</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature intended that a court be entitled to exercise its discretion in examining a request to proceed in forma pauperis. At the same time, the legislature contemplated that a court would not be allowed to arbitrarily deny such a request. Patten v. Green, 369 N.W.2d 105, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 335</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying inmate’s motion to proceed in forma pauperis where his claim against two prison employees lacked merit due to the fact that a prison employee cannot be held liable for damage to the property of a prisoner and because inmate failed to request, and therefore was not denied by the warden, access to his release aid account for court costs. Vogel v. Braun, 2001 ND 29, 622 N.W.2d 216, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to waive a wife’s filing fees because the district court had sufficient information on the wife’s financial circumstances based on the affidavits and testimony at the interim hearing, and in denying her petition, the district court acted in a reasonable manner, rather than arbitrarily. Rhodenbaugh v. Rhodenbaugh, 2019 ND 109, 925 N.W.2d 742, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 2019).

         Marriage Dissolution Fee.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The marriage dissolution fee does not significantly interfere with a person’s right to obtain a divorce; the fee does not prohibit a person from a divorce because it may be waived if the applicant is indigent. Gange v. Clerk of Burleigh County Dist. Court, 429 N.W.2d 429, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>
        Review of the district court’s decision denying a petitioner’s request to proceed in forma pauperis in a civil action is limited to determining whether or not the court abused its discretion. Patten v. Green, 369 N.W.2d 105, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 335</cite> (N.D. 1985).

         Right to Waiver.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no constitutional right to the waiver of fees in a civil action. Patten v. Green, 369 N.W.2d 105, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 335</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike this section, which allows any court in the judicial system to waive, at its discretion, filing fees for indigents in a civil action, the language of N.D.R.App.P., Rule 7 indicates that a request concerning a bond for costs on appeal must be made to the trial court. Federal Land Bank v. Overboe, 426 N.W.2d 1, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1988).

     <p>
      The district courts shall recognize and cause to be enforced any judgment, decree, or order of the tribal court of the Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation in any case involving the dissolution of marriage, the distribution of property upon divorce, child custody, adoption, an adult abuse protection order, or an adjudication of the delinquency, dependency, or neglect of Indian children if the tribal court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the judgment, decree, or order. The tribal court judgment, decree, or order must be rendered by a judge who is a graduate of an accredited law school and holds a current valid license to practice law in at least one state. A state court may inquire as to the facts of the case or tribal law only to the extent necessary to determine whether the tribal court had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the judgment, decree, or order and personal jurisdiction over the parties to the action. Recognition and enforcement of tribal court judgments, decrees, and orders under this section is conditioned upon recognition and enforcement of state court judgments, decrees, and orders by the tribal court of the Three Affiliated Tribes and tribal law enforcement agencies under the same limitations provided by this section for recognition and enforcement of tribal court judgments, decrees, and orders by state courts.

        A final order discharging a petitioner in a habeas corpus proceeding is not reviewable by appeal, but may be reviewed through the supreme court’s exercise of the constitutional power of superintending control. State ex rel. Bismarck v. District Court, 64 N.D. 399, 253 N.W. 744, 1934 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 213</cite> (N.D. 1934).

       <p>
        For persons arrested for or convicted of violating a criminal law, post-conviction relief has superseded habeas corpus as a remedy in most situations; without expressly stated circumstances warranting an exception, supreme court will decline to hear applications for habeas corpus which properly belong under post-conviction remedies.

        A final judgment dissolving a temporary injunction in dismissing a claim for a permanent injunction is not subject to stay by supersedeas, but when an appeal is filed the trial court may, in its discretion, restore the temporary injunction during the pendency of the appeal. However, refusal of trial court to do so does not limit supreme court’s power to grant a temporary injunction during pendency of the appeal to preserve status quo of the parties as an aid in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.

        An original proceeding challenging the constitutionality of apportionment and seeking an order restraining the secretary of state from acting in furtherance of the election of members of the house of representatives was a controversy affecting the sovereignty of the state and the franchises, prerogatives and liberties of the people and was within the jurisdiction of the supreme court as prescribed by section 87 of the constitution of 1889 (see now Art.

        Harmless conversation on an unrelated topic between bailiff, petitioner, and jurors during a recess at petitioner’s trial for driving under the influence did not warrant the mistrial that the trial court granted in the State’s favor and, thus, the state supreme court under its authority to grant supervisory writs, N.D. Const. art. VI, § 2 and N.D.C.C. § 27-02-04, could order the trial court to grant the motion to dismiss petitioner filed seeking dismissal of the relevant complaint in order to keep the State from retrying petitioner on that charge. Dismissal of the complaint was necessary to avoid trying petitioner in violation of petitioner’s right to be free from double jeopardy under the Fifth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend.

        Case was appropriate for the supreme court to exercise supervisory jurisdiction because the issue was whether a shareholder was entitled to a jury trial on remand after the supreme court reversed the district court’s summary judgment dismissing all of his claims for damages. 2020 ND 46; 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Because the State of North Dakota lacked the ability to realistically appeal the district court’s orders denying a motion to amend the charge against defendant or the order denying a plea agreement, the Supreme Court of North Dakota concluded that the matter was an appropriate circumstance to consider exercising the court’s supervisory jurisdiction and considered the issues raised by the State on the merits.

        Supreme Court of North Dakota lacked jurisdiction to consider the State’s appeal of the district court’s orders limiting the admission of video evidence and denying the State’s motion to amend the criminal information because the State had no statutory right to appeal the issues where the State made no argument that the case raised issues of vital concern regarding matters of important public interest or why the case was extraordinary, nothing required the court to amend an information, and a possible error by the court did not require supervision.

        Statutory arrangement for permitting a litigant to obtain change of judge, in N.D.C.C. § 29-15-21, does not conflict with any rules promulgated by the supreme court and is not unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine.

       <p>
        North Dakota Constitution in N.D. Const. art. VI, § 3 gave the state supreme court the ultimate authority to promulgate rules and, thus, those rules took precedence over the legislature’s statutes in matters of procedure, as recognized by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-02s27-02-09" target="_self">27-02-09</a></cite>. As a result, the rules of criminal procedure applied rather than statutory criminal rules in determining whether the county’s charging information sufficiently apprised defendant that defendant had violated an animal control ordinance and allowed for a determination that the information was sufficient.

      The supreme court, subject to such regulations and conditions as it may prescribe, always must be open for the issuance and return of all writs and process which it may lawfully issue and for the hearing and determination of the same. Any judge of said court may order the issuance of any such writ or process and prescribe the time and manner of service and the time and place of return of the same. In cases of habeas corpus, the judge of the supreme court who issues or causes the writ to issue may direct that the writ must be made returnable and must be heard and determined, either before the supreme court or any judge thereof, or before any district court of this state, or any judge of any district court of this state. Any district court or any judge thereof before whom any writ is made returnable as prescribed in this section is authorized to carry into complete execution all of its judgments, decrees, and determinations, subject to appeal as provided by law.

      </p>
      <p>
       “
       <b>
        LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
       </b>
       The legislative assembly recognizes that this Act to implement article VI, section 1, of the Constitution of North Dakota, while it makes no present statutory change in the current distribution of court revenue, will result in the transfer of responsibility for certain court expenditures beginning January 2, 1995, from the counties to the state, including judicial compensation expenditures associated with the transition from county court judgeships to district court judgeships. The counties will remain responsible for all county court services until January 1, 1995, and thereafter will remain responsible for all other substantial court expenditures, including costs associated with the provision of courthouse facilities and the office and staff of clerk of district court in each county.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislative assembly also recognizes that the present allocation of court revenue will change substantially, without the need for statutory revision, due to anticipated changes in judicial practices associated with the imposition of fines and assessment of court costs, thereby subjecting counties to diminished court revenues and the state to increased fine revenues to the common schools trust fund. Although it is difficult to assess the precise fiscal impact of the transition from county court judgeships to district court judgeships, the legislative assembly recognizes that the required reduction in the present number of judges under this Act will result in a substantial cost savings to all taxpayers of North Dakota through the judicial reductions that will occur, regardless of whether the court expenditures are borne by the counties or the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, it is the intent of the legislative assembly that the interim legislative council committee assigned to review and monitor the implementation of this Act pursuant to Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4043, as approved by the fifty-second legislative assembly, in conjunction with the office of the state court administrator, perform a detailed analysis of the fiscal implications of this Act prior to the convening of the fifty-third legislative assembly and the fifty-fourth legislative assembly. It is the intent of the legislative assembly that the transition to a single trial court of general jurisdiction include revision of the distribution of court revenues and legislative appropriations from the state general fund to provide a fair and equitable allocation of expenditures between the counties and the state.”

        <li id="t27c27-05s27-05-02.1ol11a">

      <li id="t27c27-05s27-05-02.1ol12">
       For purposes of subsection 1, a vacancy is also only deemed to have occurred in the office of district judge if the judge in the affected office declares the intention not to seek re-election or if a judge fails to timely file a petition for candidacy with the secretary of state pursuant to section 16.1-11-06. The secretary of state shall immediately notify the supreme court if a judge fails to timely file a petition. The supreme court may establish by rule procedures for providing notice of the intention not to seek re-election. The supreme court, within ninety days of receiving notice of a judge’s intention not to seek re-election or within twenty-one days of receiving notice that a judge has failed to timely file a petition for candidacy, shall determine whether the office is necessary for effective judicial administration. The supreme court shall consult with the judges and attorneys of the affected judicial district in making the determination. The supreme court, consistent with that determination, may order any disposition available under subsection 1. The supreme court shall notify the secretary of state of its determination.

        Fact that population and commercial enterprises, and therefore the judicial needs of the district with the judicial vacancy, are expected to increase warrants retention of the judgeship.

     <p>
      Whenever a judge of the supreme court or a judge of the district court of this state who is not a member of the public employees retirement system becomes unable, because of mental or physical disability, to perform the judicial duties of the office during the remainder of the term for which that judge has been elected or appointed and makes a written application to the chief justice or acting chief justice of the supreme court for retirement, setting forth the nature and extent of such disability, the supreme court judges and the district court judges shall make such investigation as they deem advisable. If two-thirds of the supreme court judges and the district court judges thereby determine that disability exists and that the performance of that judge’s judicial duties is thereby substantially impaired and that the impairment will not likely be remedied, the chief justice or acting chief justice, by written order to be filed in the office of the secretary of state, shall thereupon direct the retirement of the judge. The order must specify the effective date of the retirement and thereby create a vacancy in the office which must be filled by appointment as provided by law. A copy of the order must be transmitted to the office of management and budget. If the disability renders the judge unable to make or direct the making of the application, it may be made by a legally appointed guardian of the judge.

        The district court, upon appeal from an order of the county court, has only the same jurisdiction as the county court and, therefore, when the district court determines that the county court exceeded its jurisdiction in issuing the order appealed from, it may not review and correct such order in its appellate capacity. The only ways in which the district court might acquire jurisdiction over such matter are (1) through the bringing of an independent action for that purpose, or (2) through agreement by the party litigants to invoke the original jurisdiction of the district court in the matter.

Although several entities favored placing the new judgeship in Williston, North Dakota, there was a lack of space there; chambering in Watford City complied with the requirement that no more than 70 percent of the chambers be located in cities with a population of more than 10,000.

        Where a district judge has been regularly called into a district, other than his own, to try a criminal case, he may hear and decide any matter connected with the case, after the issue of fact has been disposed of by the jury, and such hearing or decision may be had in either county. State v. Tomlinson, 7 N.D. 294, 74 N.W. 995, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1898).

        A district judge had jurisdiction to try an action in another district pursuant to a request in writing by the judge of such district. First Nat'l Bank v.

        Where trial judge had jurisdiction of the person of the defendant and the subject matter of the action, a judgment rendered outside his judicial district, but within the state, was not void for want of jurisdiction.

        Review.

      <p>
       District court errs as a matter of law when it denies a respondent the full and fair hearing mandated by N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31.2-01 and due process. The same rule applies to a review of a magistrate’s decision under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-05s27-05-31" target="_self">27-05-31</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       Order of a magistrate, who has that authority performable by a district court judge as assigned by the presiding judge, N.D.C.C. § 27-05-31, is appealable to the North Dakota Supreme Court under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-27s28-27-01" target="_blank">28-27-01</a></cite>. Therefore, a district court did not err by determining that it was unable to review a magistrate’s decision to issue a disorderly conduct restraining order.

       Except as provided in subsection 2, the supreme court, within the limits of legislative appropriations and pursuant to subsection 7, shall provide clerk of district court services in each county in the state. The supreme court may provide such services through clerks of district court, deputies, and assistants who are employees of the judicial system or through service agreements under subsection 6. The supreme court shall develop standards and procedures to ensure that adequate clerk of district court services are provided. “Clerk of district court services” means those duties and services, as provided by statute or rule of the supreme court, that directly serve the judicial system and the provision of effective and efficient judicial services to the public. Beginning January 1, 2003, the individual designated by a board of county commissioners to provide clerk of district court services under subsection 2 or 6 serves as ex officio clerk of district court. The salary and bond for the ex officio clerk of district court must be fixed by a resolution adopted by the board of county commissioners.

If the county is unable to provide adequate clerk of district court services, the supreme court shall provide for those services in any manner it considers appropriate.

This subsection applies upon receipt by the supreme court of a resolution adopted by the board of county commissioners indicating its consent. Any equipment, including technology-related equipment, and furnishings in the control and custody of the clerk of district court on the date the clerk becomes a state employee must remain in the control and custody of the clerk until the state court administrator determines the items are no longer needed. The clerk, upon becoming a state employee, shall receive a salary in an amount not less than the salary received as a county employee and shall remain an employee of the state judicial system until the clerk retires, resigns, or the term for which the clerk was initially elected expires, whichever occurs earlier. Thereafter, the clerk of district court must be appointed in the manner provided by supreme court rule.

Funding must be available under the agreement to defray the cost of technology-related equipment considered necessary by the supreme court for the delivery of adequate clerk of district court services. After entering into an agreement under this subsection, a county may, under chapter 11-10.2 or 11-10.3, provide for the delivery of clerk of district court services in a manner consistent with the agreement.

    Clerk to keep record of fees — Monthly report to county auditor or state treasurer — Continuing appropriation.

     <p>
      A clerk of the district court providing clerk services in accordance with subsection 2 or 6 of section 27-05.2-02 shall keep a public record of all money received as fees for services rendered as clerk. Within three days after the close of each calendar month, the clerk shall file with the county auditor a statement under oath showing the amount of fees received as clerk since the date of the clerk’s last report and within three days thereafter the clerk shall deposit with the county treasurer the total sum of such fees which must be used for facilities, except fees that the clerk is directed to deposit with the state treasurer or is authorized expressly to retain. Within three days after the close of each calendar month, a clerk who has become a state employee under subsection 3 or 4 of section 27-05.2-02 shall file with the state treasurer a statement under oath showing the amount of fees received by the clerk since the date of the clerk’s last report. Within three days thereafter, the clerk shall deposit with the state treasurer the total sum of fees required to be deposited in the general fund or in a designated special fund. The clerk shall forward to the county treasurer any fees received under section 27-05.2-03 which are not required to be deposited in the state general fund or a designated special fund. Those fees must be used for facilities. A special court receivables fund is established in the state treasury for purposes of depositing any money received by the clerk which is not required to be deposited in the state general fund, a different special fund, or the county treasury and which is received as bail or restitution, or otherwise received pursuant to an order of the court. Moneys in the special fund are appropriated to the judicial branch on a continuing basis for purposes of refunding bail, forwarding restitution amounts to the entitled recipient, or otherwise making payments as directed by an order of the court. To facilitate making payments from the special fund, the clerk may establish a special account in the Bank of North Dakota or in a banking institution designated as a depository of public funds under chapter 21-04. If money deposited as bail is forfeited, the clerk shall submit the appropriate sum to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general fund. If the clerk is unable to make payments from the special account because the address of the recipient is unknown or the recipient cannot otherwise be located, the clerk shall dispose of the deposited money in accordance with chapter 47-30.2.

    Commencement of action — Claim affidavit.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Actions in the small claims court are commenced whenever any person executes and files with the court a claim affidavit, and causes the affidavit to be served by a person of legal age, not a party to or interested in the action, on the defendant or mails it to the defendant by certified mail with restricted delivery along with a form upon which the defendant must indicate whether a hearing is requested and whether the defendant elects to remove the action to district court. If, within twenty days of service of the affidavit and form, the court has not received a request for a hearing or an election to remove to district court, or if the defendant indicates that a hearing is not requested, a hearing will not be scheduled and judgment may be entered against the defendant by default. If the defendant requests a hearing in small claims court, the hearing must be not less than ten days and not more than thirty days after receipt of the request. Except for an action under subdivision e of subsection 2 of section 27-08.1-01, the mailing or personal service may be made anywhere within the state. Forms used in small claims court actions must be approved by the state court administrator and obtained from, or at the direction of, the clerk of district court or in electronic form from the supreme court.

       Where service upon defendant is by certified mail, court does not acquire personal jurisdiction over defendant unless and until defendant is in actual receipt of claim affidavit and order for appearance.

     </h3>
     <p>
      No formal pleadings other than the claim affidavit and order for appearance may be required, and the hearing and disposition of actions must be informal. A court reporter is not required to be present to take the testimony unless arranged for and paid for by one of the parties to the action. The defendant may file an answer, and file a claim affidavit setting forth any new matter constituting a counterclaim, not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars, which must be served upon the plaintiff by a person of legal age, not a party to or interested in the action, or mailed to the plaintiff by certified mail, not later than forty-eight hours before the hearing set for the appearance of the defendant. The compulsory counterclaim rule does not apply to counterclaims in excess of fifteen thousand dollars. At the hearing, the plaintiff and the defendant may appear without counsel. The court will conduct the proceedings and may make its own inquiry before, during, or after the hearing. After the court has found that money is owing by any party to the proceeding, the court may, in the presence of the prevailing party, inquire of the debtor as to plans for payment of the debt. The court may examine the debtor concerning the property owned by the debtor, at the hearing, as would be made under chapter 28-25. The examination may be made without first having issued an execution against the property of the debtor and without further notice as otherwise provided in chapter 28-25. A trial by jury is not allowed in small claims court. A fee as prescribed in subdivision c of subsection 1 of section 27-05.2-03 must be charged for filing the claim affidavit.

      Election by the plaintiff to use the procedures provided for in this chapter is irrevocable. In the event the plaintiff elects to discontinue the proceedings, the court shall enter its order accordingly, and unless otherwise provided in the order the dismissal must be deemed to be with prejudice. By election to proceed in small claims court, the plaintiff waives the right to appeal to any other court from the decision of the small claims court. The defendant waives the right to appeal from the decision of the small claims court upon receiving the order for appearance as required herein, unless the defendant elects to remove the action from the small claims court to district court. If the defendant elects to remove the action to district court, the defendant must serve upon the plaintiff a notice of the removal and file with the clerk of the court to which the action is removed a copy of the claim affidavit and the defendant’s answer along with the filing fee, except for an answer fee, required for civil actions. If the defendant elects to remove the action from small claims court to district court, the district court shall award attorney’s fees to a prevailing plaintiff.

        District court properly denied a subcontractor attorney fees where the remaining defendant was not part of the small claims court proceedings and was not the defendant who elected to remove the case to the district court, the subcontractor chose to amend the complaint to include the remaining defendant in the district court and ultimately dismissed all of the small claims court defendants. If the subcontractor had believed defendants acted in concert to avoid attorney fees, it should not have dismissed all but the remaining defendant. Interiors by France v.

      If the judge determines at any stage of the proceedings that the case may not be fairly disposed of in small claims court, the judge may dismiss the case without prejudice. A determination that a case may not be fairly disposed of in small claims court must be based on complexity of factual or legal issues or a determination that relief other than money damages or cancellation of an agreement is necessary to dispose of the case. If a case is dismissed under this section, the filing fee must be refunded to the plaintiff.

    Selection of jurors from judicial district — Impact of natural disaster — Grounds and method for selection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The court, upon its own motion or in response to a motion by a party, may direct that prospective jurors be selected from one or more counties in the judicial district in which the court is located if the court determines that the number of prospective jurors within the county of venue is insufficient to obtain an adequate jury pool. Following notification by the court, the clerk of court of any county in the judicial district shall submit a specified number of names, with mailing addresses, of the prospective, qualified jurors to the clerk of court of the county of venue. If a natural disaster impairs the selection of a sufficient number of prospective jurors in any county, the supreme court, by emergency order, may authorize the court in the affected county to obtain additional names and mailing addresses of prospective, qualified jurors from the clerk of court of an adjoining county or from the clerk of court of another county in the judicial district if a sufficient number of names and addresses is not available from the adjoining county.

       From time to time and in a manner prescribed by the court, the clerk shall mail to the prospective juror a qualification form accompanied by instructions to fill out and return the form by mail to the clerk within ten days after its receipt. The juror qualification form must be approved by the state court administrator as to matters of form and must elicit the name, address of residence, and age of the prospective juror and whether the prospective juror:

       Any prospective juror who fails to return a completed juror qualification form as instructed shall be directed by the clerk to appear forthwith before the clerk to fill out the juror qualification form. At the time of the prospective juror’s appearance for jury service, or at the time of any interview before the court or clerk, the prospective juror may be required to fill out another juror qualification form in the presence of the court or clerk, at which time the prospective juror may be questioned, but only with regard to responses to questions contained on the form and grounds for excuse or disqualification. Any information thus acquired by the court or clerk shall be noted on the juror qualification form.

     <p>
      The juror qualification form must contain the prospective juror’s declaration that the responses are true to the best of the prospective juror’s knowledge and the prospective juror’s acknowledgment that a willful misrepresentation of a material fact may be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than thirty days, or both. Notarization of the juror qualification form is not required. If the prospective juror is unable to fill out the form, another person may do it for the prospective juror and shall indicate that fact and the reason therefor. If it appears there is an omission, ambiguity, or error in a returned form, the clerk shall again send the form with instructions to the prospective juror to make the necessary addition, clarification, or correction and to return the form to the clerk within ten days after its second receipt.

        Supreme Court of North Dakota issued a supervisory writ reversing the district court’s order sealing the names of the jurors who sat on a highly publicized murder trial and the district court’s blanket closure of the trial jurors’
   questionnaires. Under N.D.C.C. § 27-09.1-09(3), of the Uniform Jury Selection and Service Act, the district court’s rationale for sealing the names of the jurors sitting on the murder trial after the jury was discharged was insufficient to overcome the presumption of public access.

        Where ex-wife sought to have her ex-husband held in contempt of court for failure to pay child support, it would have been “preferable, if not absolutely required” for her to have proceeded under the provisions of this chapter, rather than by motion under N.D.R.Civ.P., Rules 7(b) and 43(e). Klein v. Snider, 253 N.W.2d 425, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 261</cite> (N.D. 1977).
       </p>

        It was not an abuse of discretion to hold a former husband in contempt for failure to pay spousal support because the evidence showed, despite the former husband's retirement, the former husband had funds to pay the obligation and chose to direct the funds elsewhere. Peterson v. Peterson, 2016 ND 157, 883 N.W.2d 449, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        Finding the father in contempt was not error where he had frustrated parenting time and failed to properly communicate with the mother. Upton v. Nolan, 2018 ND 243, 919 N.W.2d 181, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in denying the husband’s request to hold the wife in contempt of court for violating the parties’ divorce judgment; the district court found that the wife’s actions in clearing title and protecting the parties from a deficiency judgment were reasonable under the divorce judgment, and even if the court agreed that the wife violated the judgment, the court would not overturn the district court as it did not act in an arbitrary manner and did not misapply the law. Cook v. Cook, 2020 ND 11, 937 N.W.2d 286, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        District court did not abuse its discretion in finding a former husband, who was the sole owner of a limited liability company, in contempt of court for violating the provisions of the judgment requiring the husband to execute a security interest and mortgage to encumber property owned by the limited liability company because the husband failed to establish an inability to comply with the judgment. Grengs v. Grengs, 2020 ND 242, 951 N.W.2d 260, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        Payments to divorced wife in accordance with express agreement were not enforceable by an attachment for contempt. Glynn v. Glynn, 8 N.D. 233, 77 N.W. 594, 1898 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1898).

        The statute defining contempt does not include failure to pay maintenance or alimony decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Gross v. Gross, 53 N.D. 480, 206 N.W. 793, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 9</cite> (N.D. 1925).

        Failure to pay for support of minor children as fixed in a final judgment of divorce is contempt. Gross v. Gross, 53 N.D. 480, 206 N.W. 793, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        Failure of husband to make monthly payments for maintenance and support of divorced wife pursuant to decree of divorce was not contempt where he had been unemployed for a long time and had no means whereby he could make payment. State v. Babcock, 64 N.D. 288, 251 N.W. 849, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 275</cite> (N.D. 1933).

        Wife’s failure to pay alimony to husband as required by decree of divorce was contempt. Gaschk v. Kohler, 70 N.D. 358, 294 N.W. 441, 1940 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1940).

        Ignoring of order requiring payment as temporary alimony and suit money of three different amounts, which was erroneous with respect to one of these amounts, but valid and proper as to the other two, was civil contempt. Hodous v. Hodous, 76 N.D. 392, 36 N.W.2d 554, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 1949).

        Civil contempt proceedings were appropriate for enforcing payment of court-ordered alimony, without first exhausting other remedies for collection of money judgment. Thorlakson v. Wells, 207 N.W.2d 326, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1973).

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by issuing an order of contempt where evidence supported a finding that the husband willfully and inexcusably violated the trial court’s interim order by intercepting rent checks that had been awarded to the wife as a part of the divorce proceedings.

        Where on a former wife’s motion her former husband was found in contempt for failing to comply with the property distribution portion of the divorce judgment, the contempt order which included a money judgment for the amount owed under the judgment and a writ of attachment, stayed for a set time to allow the husband to purge himself of his contempt, constituted remedial contempt.

        District court abused its discretion in holding a father in contempt because a mother did not allege that any of the provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 28-21 governing execution and levy were violated, and the circumstances did not amount to an intentional disobedience of a court order under
   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-10s27-10-01" target="_self">27-10-01</a></cite>.1(1)(c); a district court order merely denied the father’s request for an equitable offset of the parties’

        District court went beyond the scope of a former wife’s contempt motions in amending a divorce judgment because its modification of the judgment as a part of its contempt order failed to comport with due process; although neither party moved to amend the divorce judgment, the district court amended, rather than clarified, the judgment, and the hearing notice and hearing itself involved the parties’ competing motions for contempt sanctions.

       <p>
        It was not an abuse of discretion not to hold a mother in contempt for alleged interference with a father's parenting time because the evidence showed (1) the father did not try to pick the children up for parenting time if the children stated a desire not to go, and (2) the mother encouraged the children to visit with their father but the children refused.

        Contempt order was modified to state that a husband was not in contempt of court for failing to deliver a decal cutter to his wife because the husband could not be held in contempt for failing to deliver the decal cutter; the parties corrected the situation by their stipulation, which required the husband to pay the wife the value of the decal cutter.

        Court disagreed that one provision in the divorce judgment about out-of-state trips with the children was ambiguous, but even assuming the ex-husband did not grant permission for the trip, this did not mandate a finding that the ex-wife committed contempt; the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to find the ex-wife in contempt for her alleged technical violation of the divorce judgment. Rath v. Rath, 2013 ND 243, 840 N.W.2d 656, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Denial of a motion to find the ex-wife in contempt was affirmed where the children testified that they did not want to visit their father, and nothing in the record suggested that the ex-wife had intentionally kept the child from visiting the ex-husband.

        District court did not abuse its discretion when it determined a wife was not in contempt because the wife's efforts to reschedule phone calls did not amount to contempt and an order to show cause was unnecessary; even if the rescheduling did constitute a failure to follow the judgment, technical violations of a court order did not necessarily require a finding of contempt.

       <p>
        District court properly denied a father's motions for recusal, for change of judge in child support modification proceedings, to hold the mother in contempt of the divorce judgment, and to reconsider because the father waived his issues on appeal regarding recusal, the orders denying his demands for change of judge were interlocutory and not appealable, the father's relentless filing of meritless motions was clearly for purposes of harassing the mother, the court thoroughly explained its reasons for refusing to hold the mother in contempt, and the father failed to establish any contempt on the part of the mother.

        District court erred by ordering the ex-wife to reimburse the ex-husband for the transportation costs associated with his missed parenting time because the district court found there was not sufficient evidence to find the wife in contempt for failing to ensure the children were on a flight so the husband could exercise his parenting time in California as the children snuck off the flight on their own accord.

       <p>
        District court did not err in refraining from conducting contempt proceedings because, while a father's motions for an order to show cause and relief from judgment were repetitive, without merit, and frivolous the court warned the father that if he continued to file similar motions, it would sanction him in the future where the child's right to receive mail and gifts from a parent without obstruction or interference by the other was not a right of the parent and the father should not have attempted to send a cell phone to the child when he knew it was against the mother's wishes despite his difficulty in conducting telephone conversations with his children.

        District court did not err when it found that a former partner was in contempt of the court’s amended judgment because he engaged in business activities similar to those of the former partnership, from which he had been restrained for three years, nor did the court err when it assessed, as a contempt sanction, 5% of the amount the former partner had been paid for his share of the partnership and attorney fees and costs.

        District court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to impose sanctions against the State’s counsel because its findings were sufficient; the district court found that neither the State nor its attorneys made willful misrepresentations of fact in their answer to the claims, the joint answer and defenses asserted were appropriate as allowed by law, and the State had not needlessly increased the cost and length of litigation.

        District court erred, inter alia, in finding a majority member of an LLC in contempt for knowingly making and filing a false affidavit and imposing a sanction requiring a forfeiture of $300,000 to the minority members because, to the extent the sanction was punitive, it was improperly imposed where the sanction was not conditioned upon the performance or nonperformance of an act, the court not provide any link between the sanction and a loss or injury suffered by the minority members as a result of the contempt, and the record was insufficient to determine whether a remedial sanction in the amount ordered was appropriate.

         The court on its own motion or motion of a person aggrieved by contempt of court may seek imposition of a remedial sanction for the contempt by filing a motion for that purpose in the proceeding to which the contempt is related. The court, after notice and hearing, may impose a remedial sanction authorized by this chapter. In a proceeding to impose a remedial sanction for failure to pay child or spousal support, an order to pay support is prima facie evidence the obligor has the ability to pay, and the burden of persuasion is upon the obligor to prove inability to pay the support ordered.

         The state’s attorney of a county, the attorney general, or a special prosecutor appointed by the court may seek the imposition of a punitive sanction by issuing a complaint charging a person with contempt of court and reciting the sanction sought to be imposed. The state’s attorney, attorney general, or special prosecutor may initiate issuance of the complaint or may issue the complaint on the request of a party to an action or proceeding in a court or of the judge presiding in an action or proceeding. A judge is disqualified from presiding at the trial of an alleged contemnor if a reasonable likelihood or appearance of bias or prejudice will otherwise exist, if the contempt alleged involves disrespect or criticism of the judge, or if the judge has personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts. The person charged is entitled to a trial by jury.

        North Dakota Supreme Court had jurisdiction over the appeal challenging the contempt order and judgment for sanctions because under N.D.C.C. §
   <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-10s27-10-01" target="_self">27-10-01</a></cite>.3(3), an order or judgment finding a person guilty of contempt was a final order or judgment for purposes of appeal, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing discovery sanctions, as the order was not vague and the reviewing court was satisfied defendants’ actions were willful and intentional. Dietz v. Kautzman, 2004 ND 164, 686 N.W.2d 110, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 299</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        On appeal, the court determines if the trial court’s order of contempt was remedial or punitive, and whether in issuing the order, the dictates of this section were followed. Endersbe v. Endersbe, 555 N.W.2d 580, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        In the ongoing litigation over the father’s visitation rights, the mother failed to timely appeal the January 2003 contempt order and was, therefore, bound by it. However, her appeal of a March 2004 trial court order finding her in contempt was within the allowed 60 day time-frame and was, therefore, properly before the North Dakota Supreme Court; moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it held the mother in contempt for her repeated frustration of the father’s visitation rights, and her making unsubstantiated claims of abuse by the father, and the contempt order was remedial, not punitive.
   Negaard v. Negaard, 2005 ND 96, 696 N.W.2d 498, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 107</cite> (N.D. 2005), overruled in part, Strand v. Cass County, 2008 ND 149, 753 N.W.2d 872, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 2008).

        Although it was unnecessary for the district court to address the husband's request for contempt, and because the wife's conduct in transferring jointly held marital assets to the parties' son was also considered as part of the husband's claim for equitable relief, the district court's denial of the claim reached the correct result, but for the wrong reason. In re Estate of Albrecht v. Albrecht, 2018 ND 67, 908 N.W.2d 135, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        Where a court did not possess the right or power to punish as for contempt a disregard or violation of its order which it had rendered without jurisdiction over the subject matter or the parties, lack of such jurisdiction or power could be raised by the person charged with contempt in collateral proceedings on appeal from the judgment of conviction for contempt.

The court should have observed that father requested a hearing and, in addition, the father was entitled to a hearing under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-10s27-10-01" target="_self">27-10-01</a></cite>.3(1)(a) on both his and the mother’s motions. The father’s cancellation of the subsequently scheduled hearing did not constitute a waiver of his right, as the father justifiably canceled the hearing believing the district court had ruled and would take no further action. Although there were procedural irregularities on the part of both the father and the court, the father had a right to be heard unless there was some indication the irregularities were designed to mislead the court and, in this case, the actions here by father and the district court appeared to have misled each other unintentionally.

        District court abused its discretion by ordering counsel to pay $100 in attorney’s fees to opposing counsel for unilaterally setting a hearing date; attorney’s conduct did not fit within any of the definitions of contempt in N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-10s27-10-01" target="_self">27-10-01</a></cite>.1.

        If the sanction’s purpose is coercive, that is, to induce performance of an act primarily for another’s benefit, the contempt is civil; if the contemptuous conduct has been concluded and the purpose of the sanction is to punish the offender and vindicate the authority of the court, the contempt is criminal. Baier v. Hampton, 417 N.W.2d 801, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 460</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        In an action for post child support while the husband was found to be in civil contempt and required to serve 60 days in jail, but 30 days could be purged by paying $205 in back support, the label of civil contempt of court was not conclusive. In view of the nature and purpose of the sanctions, husband’s contempt was both civil and criminal. Baier v. Hampton, 417 N.W.2d 801, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 460</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Construing the introductory language of this section to authorize an unconditional jail sentence for civil contempt overlooks the coercive-punitive distinction between civil and criminal contempt; therefore, that language will be construed to prescribe the maximum sanction for civil contempt which may be imposed to coerce performance.

        In the ongoing litigation over the father’s visitation rights, the mother failed to timely appeal the January 2003 contempt order and was, therefore, bound by it. However, her appeal of a March 2004 trial court order finding her in contempt was within the allowed 60 day time-frame and was, therefore, properly before the North Dakota Supreme Court; moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it held the mother in contempt for her repeated frustration of the father’s visitation rights, and her making unsubstantiated claims of abuse by the father, and the contempt order was remedial, not punitive.

        Supreme court exercised its discretion to review an issue raised in a mother's case because the mother had been incarcerated solely for contempt for well over 400 straight days, and the issue raised in the case was a question of first impression and involved a district court's authority to incarcerate persons found to be in contempt of court indefinitely; the issue was one of vital concern regarding matters of important public interest.

        As a remedial sanction, the sanction of imprisonment to ensure compliance with a previous order of the court is by definition conditioned on performance of an act required by a court order; because it is conditional, every remedial sanction of imprisonment is designed to ensure compliance with a previous order.

        District court did not err when it found that a former partner was in contempt of the court’s amended judgment because he engaged in business activities similar to those of the former partnership, from which he had been restrained for three years, nor did the court err when it assessed, as a contempt sanction, 5% of the amount the former partner had been paid for his share of the partnership and attorney fees and costs. Since repair and installation of furnaces and air conditioning equipment accounted for five percent of the former partnership’s total business, the district court determined it would be appropriate to require the former partner to pay the complaining former partner five percent of the purchase price the complaining former partner paid his former partner for the business upon the dissolution of the partnership.

        District court did not abuse its discretion when it determined a wife was not in contempt because the wife's efforts to reschedule phone calls did not amount to contempt and an order to show cause was unnecessary; even if the rescheduling did constitute a failure to follow the judgment, technical violations of a court order did not necessarily require a finding of contempt.

        District court did not err in denying a husband's motion for an order to show cause before the wife filed a reply because even if the wife filed a reply and admitted all of the husband's allegations, the husband still could not have prevailed since his allegations would not warrant a finding of contempt.

        When a father sought to hold a mother in contempt, it was not an abuse of discretion to deny the father’s motion without a hearing because (1) the father did not request oral argument, (2) whether to hold a hearing was within the court’s discretion, and, (3) based on the parties’ submissions, the court found the father did not meet the father’s evidentiary burden to support the requested relief.

        Personal representative’s argument that he did not get notice that he could have been held in contempt for not making a court-ordered payment was rejected because the stated purpose of a hearing was to show cause why the estate had not been closed, a petition stated that the personal representative failed to make the payment, it was made clear that the refusal to make the payment was the issue, the personal representative did not claim surprise, and he presented no testimony on his behalf.

        District court did not err in refraining from conducting contempt proceedings because, while a father's motions for an order to show cause and relief from judgment were repetitive, without merit, and frivolous the court warned the father that if he continued to file similar motions, it would sanction him in the future where the child's right to receive mail and gifts from a parent without obstruction or interference by the other was not a right of the parent and the father should not have attempted to send a cell phone to the child when he knew it was against the mother's wishes despite his difficulty in conducting telephone conversations with his children.

      When a person accused of contempt is arrested upon a warrant of attachment, the sheriff, if the amount of the undertaking for the appearance of the accused is not endorsed on the warrant, or if such an endorsement is made and an undertaking is not given as prescribed in section 27-10-10, shall keep the accused in custody until the further direction of the court. When from sickness or other cause the accused is physically unable to attend before the court, that fact is a sufficient excuse to the sheriff for not producing the accused as required by the warrant. In that case, the sheriff shall produce the accused as directed by the court after the accused becomes able to attend. The sheriff in any case need not confine the accused in prison or otherwise restrain the accused except so far as is necessary in order to secure the accused’s personal attendance.

State v. Simpson, 78 N.D. 360, 49 N.W.2d 777, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1951), disapproved, Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S. Ct. 1184, 25 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        In proceedings for contempt of court the complaint in the form of an affidavit is sufficient when it states the facts and circumstances so that the defendant has notice thereof and can prepare to meet the charge. Raszler v. Raszler, 80 N.W.2d 535, 1956 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 1956).

        Interrogatories filed under the old statute in contempt proceedings were required to relate to facts in respect to which the contempt was charged. State v. Harris, 14 N.D. 501, 105 N.W. 621, 1905 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement of the old statute that the court or judge before whom an accused was produced cause interrogatories to be filed, specifying the circumstances of the offense charged, was mandatory. State v. Dufek, 49 N.D. 851, 193 N.W. 928, 1922 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the recodification of 1943, which substituted the words “complaint in the form of an affidavit” for the word “interrogatories,” the accused is still given the rights that he had under the old statute of being informed what the charge is and his right to answer. State v. Simpson, 78 N.D. 360, 49 N.W.2d 777, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1951), disapproved, Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S. Ct. 1184, 25 L.

In an action brought pursuant to such direction, the state is entitled to recover the entire sum specified in the undertaking. Out of the money collected, the court which directed the prosecution must order the person at whose instance a warrant was issued to be paid such a sum as it thinks proper to satisfy the costs and expenses incurred by the person and to compensate the person for the loss or injury sustained by reason of the misconduct. The residue of the money must be paid into the treasury of this state to the credit of the school fund.

        District court properly denied a creditor's request for her husband to speak on her behalf because the husband was not a party to the action and was not a licensed attorney; if the wife challenged the statute on its face, she did not complied with N.D. R. App. P. 44, and the district court's application of the statute did not infringe on the husband's right to free speech. Am. Express Centurion Bank v.

        Trial court dismissed a breach of contract case filed by plaintiffs, the buyer and his business partner, against defendant seller, because plaintiff failed to present proof of their alleged partnership. The trial court was concerned that plaintiff partner’s appearance and his admitted sharing of pleadings with the buyer constituted the unauthorized practice of law under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t27c27-11s27-11-01" target="_self">27-11-01</a></cite>.

        To permit a lay person to represent a criminal defendant would sanction the unauthorized practice of law, which the statutes of North Dakota expressly prohibit. State v. Benson, 376 N.W.2d 36, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 460</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        The statutory prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law is intended to protect the public from unlicensed attorneys and is to be liberally construed with a view to effecting its objects and promoting justice.

        Business’s restraining order against the customer was vacated because the business was never represented by an attorney, and its petition was void from the beginning, when the matter was commenced on behalf of the business by a non-attorney agent, the business’s manager.
   A corporation may not be represented by a non-attorney agent in a legal proceeding.

R. 13 and to exempt processes regarding admission to the bar from public disclosure; mandamus relief was denied to an unsuccessful bar applicant seeking bar records because Rule 13 was neither subordinate to N.D.C.C. § 44-04-18 nor unconstitutional under N.D. Const. art. XI, § 6, which provided for public inspection of government records.

         Grading of Examination.

        Evidence was insufficient to show that grading of bar applicant’s essay examination was arbitrary and capricious. McGinn v. State Bar Bd., 399 N.W.2d 864, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        An applicant challenging the effectiveness of a bar examination has the burden of establishing its unreliability. This court will neither regrade a bar examination, nor set aside an examination result, without proof that the bar board acted arbitrarily and unreasonably. Faulconbridge v.

     <p>
      A person who has an unrevoked certificate of admission to the bar of this state and who desires to engage in the practice of law, or who is to serve as a judge of a court of record, must secure an annual license from the state board of law examiners on or before January first of each year. The secretary-treasurer of the board shall issue the license upon compliance with the rules adopted or approved by the supreme court to assure the professional competence of attorneys, and upon payment of a fee established by the state bar association at its annual meeting, by a majority vote of its members in attendance at the meeting, not to exceed four hundred dollars. The license is valid for the calendar year for which it is issued. Issuance of an annual license to practice law may not be conditioned upon payment of any surcharge, assessment, or fee in excess of the maximum fee established by this section. This section does not prohibit imposition of a reasonable fee for filing and processing reports of compliance with continuing education requirements.

        In settling a collection with his client, an attorney must make a full disclosure of the facts. Riegi v. Phelps, 4 N.D. 272, 60 N.W. 402, 1894 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1894).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Any fee agreement made during the existence of the attorney-client relationship must be construed most strongly against the attorney, who has the burden of showing the fairness of the agreement. McAdam v. Dynes, 442 N.W.2d 914, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the establishment of an attorney-client relationship, the essentials of an express fee contract for legal services are the same as any other contract of employment, and the parties may deal with each other at arm’s length. However, because of the confidential nature of the attorney-client relationship, compensation agreements made during the existence of that relationship are closely scrutinized and construed most strongly against the attorney.

       <p>
        Deceit is a ground for disbarment where there is intent to deceive a court, judge, or party. Simpson, 9 N.D. 379, 83 N.W. 541, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 1900); Freerks, 11 N.D. 120, 90 N.W. 265, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1902).

       <p>
        Procuring the entry of a fraudulent judgment is deceit. Freerks, 11 N.D. 120, 90 N.W. 265, 1902 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attorney who settles a lawsuit upon misrepresentation to his client is guilty of deceit. In re Bryans, 52 N.D. 673, 204 N.W. 9, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an attorney verifies a complaint which he must know to be false, he violates his duty as an attorney. In re Bryans, 52 N.D. 673, 204 N.W. 9, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney’s testimony that third party had no agreement to pay client’s attorney fees, where documentary evidence showed agreement for fees to be paid by third party, was deceptive, misleading and evasive, and a violation of this section.
   Disciplinary Bd. of the Supreme Court v. Lamont (In re Lamont), 1997 ND 63, 561 N.W.2d 650, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing circumstantial evidence existed to support a finding that attorney made false statements in a judicial proceeding by claiming that notice and service requirements were met while representing a client in making a claim for abandoned mineral interests, and that attorney offered false evidence by presenting a forged envelope in support of his claim that notice and service requirements were timely met. Disciplinary Bd. v. McDonald (In re McDonald), 2000 ND 87, 609 N.W.2d 418, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Interim suspension of respondent attorney was ordered where the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of North Dakota asserted that the attorney had committed misconduct and that he posed a substantial threat of irreparable harm to the public because he had forged court documents and a signature on an affidavit, and had provided client with copies of a complaint purportedly filed in a medical malpractice action which, in fact, had not been filed.

        An attorney, while the relation of attorney and client exists, may not acquire a beneficial interest in or title to the subject matter of the litigation antagonistic to the title or interest of his client.

       <p>
        The practice of law is a matter of vital interest to the general public in North Dakota, since lawyers are engaged in the preservation and protection of the fundamental liberties and rights of the people; thus attorneys are engaged in the carrying out of fundamental aims and purposes of government.

        It is the duty of an attorney to maintain the secrets of his client inviolate, and the communications received by him are confidential and inadmissible in evidence, although the relationship of attorney and client has terminated. Fosston Mfg. Co. v. Lemke, 44 N.D. 343, 175 N.W. 723, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite> (N.D. 1919).

        Where damages were awarded for legal malpractice but the trial court found no actual damages as a result of defendants’ “acts of deceit,” the trial court did not err in refusing to treble the award.

        In a suit between attorneys who competed for the same clients, plaintiff lacked standing to pursue a claim against defendants under N.D.C.C. § 27-13-08 because he was not an injured party thereunder; rather his claims were a generalized grievance, and his specific assertions rested on the legal rights and interests third parties, those third parties being defendants’ clients.

        The trial court’s award of nominal damages of $2500 each for four separate acts which was then trebled, was reversed, for at least two reasons. First, the damages were not nominal; nominal damages are limited to one dollar. More significantly, however, no nominal damage award was allowable, where three of the four acts of the defendants for which nominal damages were awarded, were based upon the trial court’s findings that these acts were either an attempt to defraud or were acts of deceit. The trial court also determined, however, that neither the deceased alleged victim nor the estate suffered any damage as a result of these acts. Olson v. Fraase, 421 N.W.2d 820, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Accepting a retainer, on the promise to commence the probate of an estate, by a person whose certificate of admission to the bar was suspended constitutes a false pretense with intent to defraud, which is a felony. In re Lyons, 193 N.W.2d 462, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 1971).

        Attorney who pleaded guilty to charge of conspiracy to violate federal statute prohibiting bank officer from receiving fee, commission, gift or thing of value in exchange for procuring a loan was guilty of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, and his certificate was suspended for six months. In re Anderson, 195 N.W.2d 345, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1972).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An attorney’s accepting money when acting as a prosecuting officer, knowing it was intended to influence him, is ground for disbarment. In re Crum, 55 N.D. 876, 215 N.W. 682, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an attorney’s pre-disbarment misconduct included bribery, the betrayal of a client’s interests, the misuse of a trust account and the failure to file a correct petition regarding fees in a bankruptcy case, the appropriate disciplinary action was disbarment and to fix the time in which he could apply for reinstatement to be not less than three years. In re Application of Kraemer, 411 N.W.2d 71, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 381</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A conviction in a criminal proceeding is not a prerequisite to the institution of disciplinary proceedings, nor is acquittal necessarily a bar thereto. In re Application of Kraemer, 411 N.W.2d 71, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 381</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        Disobedience of court order directing preparation of findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order of judgment, and failure to return the case filed to the clerk or respond to inquiries from his client and the court clerk, justified attorney’s suspension from the practice of law. In re Maddock, 265 N.W.2d 229, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1977).

       <p>
        Certificate of admission to practice law was revoked by supreme court where attorney was convicted of embezzlement and offered no resistance to revocation of his certificate. In re Application for George, 182 N.W.2d 868, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney who, upon completion of tax return in each of five consecutive years, accepted more than one hundred dollars with which to pay the tax but neither filed the return nor paid the tax, fraudulently appropriated the money and was guilty of felonious embezzlement. In re Lyons, 193 N.W.2d 462, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 1971).

       <p>
        Although attorney’s habitual failure to attend to matters entrusted to him and failure to communicate with his clients was partly attributable to health and other personal problems, such conduct warranted a one year suspension from the practice of law. Disciplinary Bd. of Supreme Court v. O'Neil, 326 N.W.2d 879, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 408</cite> (N.D. 1982).

       <p>
        Attorney’s conduct violated the Code of Professional Responsibility, specifically disciplinary rules DR 1-101(A) and DR 1-102(A)(4), (5) and (6), and warranted his suspension from the practice of law for at least ninety days, where, to prevent his past life from being discovered, he deliberately failed to disclose his military record as requested on the application for admission to the bar and, subsequent to his admission to the bar, he deliberately gave misinformation concerning his date and place of birth, former places of residence and former employment, and his holding of driver licenses from other states in his applications for an insurance agent’s license and a driver’s license.

        Acceptance of an attorney’s fee as a retainer, on the promise to commence the probate of an estate, by a person whose certificate of admission to the bar was suspended constitutes a false pretense with intent to defraud, which is a felony, and his license to practice was revoked.

       Every judge of the supreme court or of the district court, including one who has served or shall have served in either or both capacities, shall, at the time the judge ceases to be such judge and regardless of the individual’s age at that time and without further payment by that individual into the judicial retirement fund, acquire a vested right to the judicial retirement salary herein provided for, payable upon application therefor at any time after that individual has attained any of the retirement ages with years of service, as follows:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-01ol11a">
         65 and 20 years of service;

         67 and 16 years of service;

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-01ol12">
       If a judge has served fewer than the years of service above required for any given retirement age, the judge is entitled to receive judicial retirement salary only in proportion that the judge’s years of service bear to the years of service otherwise required for retirement at such age. Any judge who has not served at least ten years on reaching that individual’s seventy-third birthday may not be deemed to have waived retirement benefits under this chapter, provided the judge retires at the expiration of the judge’s present term.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-01ol13">
       The amount of judicial retirement salary payable to a retired judge under subsection 1 must be equal to fifty percent of the annual salary payable to judges of the classification the retired judge had at the time the individual retired, provided that prior to retirement the individual was re-elected as a judge of either the supreme or district court following July 1, 1973, but in no event may the individual’s judicial retirement salary be computed upon a judicial salary less than the one the individual last received prior to re-election. The amendment to this section may not be construed to affect supreme or district court judges who shall have retired prior to July 1, 1973, or who shall retire during or at the end of their term of office which commenced prior to that date. As used in this subsection, the word “re-elected” also includes election of a former district judge to the supreme court, and election of a former supreme court judge to the district court.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-01ol14">
       The judicial retirement salary payable under this section must be paid to the retired judge during the remainder of the individual’s natural life and must be paid by the director of the office of management and budget, within thirty days after receiving application therefor, in the same manner as salaries are paid to judges of the district court and judges of the supreme court, except that judicial retirement salaries are not subject to judicial retirement assessment.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-01ol15">
       In lieu of receiving the judicial retirement salary otherwise payable under this chapter, the judge, at any time after having attained retirement age, may irrevocably elect to receive judicial retirement salary according to one of the following optional modes of payment:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-01ol15a">
         First Option. Three-fourths of the judge’s retirement salary payable to the judge alone until death and thereafter one-half of such amount payable to the surviving spouse upon the spouse’s attaining sixty-two years of age and until the spouse remarries or dies.
        </li>
        <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-01ol15b">
         Second Option. Two-thirds of the judge’s retirement salary payable to the judge alone until death and thereafter a like amount payable to the surviving spouse upon the spouse’s attaining sixty-two years of age and until the spouse remarries or dies.
        </li>
        <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-01ol15c">
         Third Option. One-half of the judge’s retirement salary payable to the judge until death and a like amount payable to the spouse upon the spouse’s attaining sixty-two years of age and so long as the spouse continues to be the judge’s spouse or unremarried surviving spouse.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Provided, however, that any judge of the supreme court or district court who is appointed or elected to such court from and after July 1, 1960, who has become eligible for retirement hereunder but fails to make application therefor prior to attaining the age of seventy-three years, shall automatically waive all retirement benefits hereunder and shall receive a return of only such moneys as have been retained by the state of North Dakota as a judicial retirement assessment, upon the salary of such judge.
     </p>
     <p>
      The election of one of the foregoing optional modes of payment must be made in the application for payment of judicial retirement salary, or by written declaration of such election, signed by the judge and delivered to the director of the office of management and budget. In the event the judge has elected an optional mode of payment and dies without having made application for judicial retirement salary, the judicial retirement salary payable to the surviving spouse according to the judge’s option is payable to the surviving spouse in the same manner as if the judge had made application for judicial retirement salary. In the event that a judge entitled to retirement pay dies without having elected an optional mode of payment, the surviving spouse is entitled to payments as provided by the first option as set forth in subdivision a. Judicial retirement salary payable according to one of the foregoing optional modes of payment must be paid in like manner as the full judicial retirement salary is paid. Any judge who retired prior to the effective date of the amendment to this section as provided for in chapter 222 of the 1961 Session Laws, and otherwise eligible for the optional modes of payment herein provided for, may apply for one of the optional modes of payment by written declaration to the director of the office of management and budget; provided, however, such judge shall repay to the state treasury the amount of money the individual has drawn since the date of the individual’s retirement in excess of what the individual would have drawn if the individual had chosen the optional mode of payment now applied for at the date of the individual’s retirement.

       Every judge of the supreme court or of the district court is subject to a judicial retirement assessment in the amount of five percent of the judge’s salary during the first twenty years of service as such judge, from and after the effective date of this section, which amount must be deducted, withheld, and retained by the state of North Dakota. In computing the period of assessment, every judge must be credited with all previous years in which judicial retirement assessments have been deducted and withheld from the judge’s salary.

       In lieu of receiving judicial retirement salary under this chapter, a judge of the supreme court or a judge of the district court, or in the event of the judge’s death, the surviving spouse or legal representative, upon application to the supreme court at any time after the person ceases to be such judge and without having made application for and received judicial retirement salary under this chapter, is entitled to receive the amount of judicial retirement assessments heretofore or hereafter deducted and withheld by the state of North Dakota. If such judge has received judicial retirement salary under this chapter, the amount of judicial retirement assessments deducted and withheld by the state of North Dakota in excess of judicial retirement salary received by such judge, are payable, in the event of the judge’s death, but not otherwise, to the surviving spouse if living, otherwise to the judge’s legal representative.

       If any former judge, after having withdrawn judicial retirement assessments withheld by the state of North Dakota, shall thereafter become a judge of the supreme court or of the district court of this state, the person may, at the person’s election, within one year after becoming such judge, reinstate the person’s prior years of service by returning to the fund the amount withdrawn by the person, with simple interest at the rate of four percent per annum from the time of such withdrawal.

       Upon retirement of a justice of the supreme court or a judge of the district court, the chief justice of the supreme court may appoint the retired justice or judge to serve as a surrogate judge of the supreme court to aid and assist the court in the performance of judicial duties within the unified judicial system as may be assigned by the chief justice with the retired justice’s or judge’s consent.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-03ol12">
       An appointment under this section does not become effective until the appointee subscribes and files in the office of the secretary of state an oath or affirmation substantially as follows: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support the constitutions of the United States and the state of North Dakota, and that I will faithfully discharge the duties of the office of surrogate judge of the state of North Dakota to the best of my ability.”
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-03ol13">
       Subject to subsection 4, a surrogate judge is entitled to receive compensation for services rendered for each day actually engaged in the performance of judicial duties in an amount equal to five percent of the gross monthly salary of a regularly elected or appointed and qualified justice or judge of the court to which the services are rendered, or one-half of that daily compensation for services of one-half day or less.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-03ol14">
       A surrogate judge is not entitled to receive as compensation for services rendered in the performance of judicial duties during any calendar year a sum of money which when added to any judicial retirement benefits received by the surrogate judge for that year exceeds the annual salary of a justice or judge of the court from which the justice or judge retired. The compensation must be paid upon the certificate of the surrogate judge showing that the services were performed for the number of days claimed in the certificate. Services of a surrogate judge under this section and receipt of compensation therefor do not reduce or otherwise affect the amount of any retirement benefits to which the judge otherwise would be entitled.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-03ol15">
       In addition to daily compensation, a surrogate judge is entitled to receive reimbursement for travel expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of judicial duties under the assignment, as regularly elected or appointed and qualified justices and judges are entitled to receive.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-17s27-17-03ol16">
       A retired justice of the supreme court or a retired judge of the district court is also eligible to serve as a master and to be compensated for services rendered in any civil case or other judicial proceeding when so designated by the court having power to appoint masters; a retired justice or judge, when requested, is also eligible to serve as legal counsel and to be compensated for services rendered in the office of the attorney general, in any executive department, commission, or bureau of the state, and for any committee of the legislative assembly.

        Although methods by which Indians may accept jurisdiction of state courts over civil causes of action have been provided, such jurisdiction has not been accepted by Indians on any North Dakota reservation; until Indians do so accept, the state has no jurisdiction over any civil cause arising on an Indian reservation.

       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in entering a default judgment in favor of the lessees because 1) the tribal court had jurisdiction as the lessees entered into a consensual relationship with the lessors through the lease; 2) the tribal code allowed the tribal court to exercise jurisdiction over the ownership, leasehold, use, or possession of any property, or interest therein, located within the tribal court’s territorial jurisdiction, which included all land on the reservation; 3) North Dakota disclaimed jurisdiction over reservation lands; and 4) the Indian tribe had not consented to state court civil jurisdiction under N.D.C.C. ch. 27-19.

         Intrusion on Indians’ Sovereign Immunity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The extent of the waiver presently required by this chapter is unduly intrusive on the Indians’ common law sovereign immunity, and thus on its ability to govern itself according to its own laws. By requiring that the Tribe open itself up to the coercive jurisdiction of state courts for all matters occurring on the reservation, the statute invites a potentially severe impairment of the authority of the tribal government, its courts, and its laws.
   Three Affiliated Tribes of Ft. Berthold Reservation v. Wold Engineering, P. C., 476 U.S. 877, 106 S. Ct. 2305, 90 L. Ed. 2d 881, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 58 (U.S. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the parties were married and lived together on the reservation with the children up until the time of separation, the district court’s exercise of jurisdiction over child custody and support in the non-Indian spouse’s divorce action infringed on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them. Byzewski v. Byzewski, 429 N.W.2d 394, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a jurisdictional holding results in denying a non-Indian plaintiff a state court forum in an action against an Indian which arises on the reservation and is therefore within the tribal court’s exclusive jurisdiction, such disparate treatment of the Indian is justified because it is intended to benefit the class of which he is a member by furthering the congressional policy of Indian self-government.

No action has been taken in North Dakota in compliance with Public Law 90-284 and, consequently, North Dakota does not have jurisdiction over Indians residing within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation. Some provisions of this chapter such as section 27-19-05 and possibly this section are no longer effective because of Public Law 90-284. Malaterre v. Malaterre, 293 N.W.2d 139, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1980).

     <p>
      Nothing in this section authorizes the alienation, encumbrance, or taxation of any real or personal property belonging to any Indian or Indian tribe, band, or community that is held in trust by the United States or is subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States; or authorizes regulation of the use of the property in a manner inconsistent with any federal treaty, agreement, or statute, or with any regulation made pursuant thereto; or confers jurisdiction upon the state to adjudicate, in probate proceedings or otherwise, the ownership or right to possession of such property or any interest therein. The civil jurisdiction herein accepted and assumed includes the determination of parentage of children, termination of parental rights, commitments by district courts, guardianship, marriage contracts, and obligations for the support of spouse, children, or other dependents.

At least sixty days before the expiration of the initial order of appointment or any following order of reappointment, the court shall request and consider information submitted by the guardian, the child, if fourteen years of age or older, the child’s attorney, if any, the child’s parents, and any interested persons regarding whether the need for a guardianship continues to exist. The court, at its discretion, may appoint a guardian ad litem in accordance with section 27-20.1-08, before the hearing. The court shall hold a hearing on whether the guardianship should continue. Following the hearing and consideration of submitted information, the court may:

       Upon petition by a person interested in the child’s welfare, the court may appoint an emergency guardian if the court finds that compliance with the procedures of this chapter will likely result in substantial harm to the child’s health, safety, or welfare. Immediately upon receipt of the petition for an emergency guardian, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to advocate for the best interests of the child.

      <li id="t27c27-20.1s27-20.1-18ol12">
       An emergency guardian may be appointed without hearing or notice to the child, the child’s parent or legal custodian, or the child’s guardian ad litem only if the court finds from affidavit or other sworn testimony that the child will be substantially harmed before a hearing can be held. If the court appoints an emergency guardian without hearing or notice to the child, the child’s parent or legal custodian, or the child’s guardian ad litem, the child, the child’s parent or legal custodian, and the child’s guardian ad litem must be given notice of the emergency appointment by the petitioner within forty-eight hours after the emergency appointment. The court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the emergency appointment within ninety- six hours after the emergency appointment or filing of the petition.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-20.1s27-20.1-18ol13">
       Reasonable notice, either oral or written, stating the time, place, and purpose of the hearing must be given to the child, if fourteen years of age or older, and, to the child’s parents or legal custodian, if they can be found. If oral notice is provided, the petitioner must file an affidavit stating that oral notice including the time, place, and purpose of the hearing has been provided.

      <li id="t27c27-20.1s27-20.1-18ol14">
       The court shall determine if there is probable cause to believe the emergency appointment is in the best interest of the child and one of the provisions of subsection 1 of section 27-20.1-11 is met.

      <li id="t27c27-20.1s27-20.1-18ol15">
       If the emergency guardian is found to be appropriate, the court may order the emergency guardian remain in place for no more than sixty days from the date of the hearing. The court may extend the emergency order for up to six months.

The court may not order the removal unless evidence of active efforts shows there has been a vigorous and concerted level of casework beyond the level that would constitute reasonable efforts under section 27-20.3-26. Reasonable efforts may not be construed to be active efforts. Active efforts must be made in a manner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values, conditions, and way of life of the Indian child’s tribe.

       The court may order the removal of the Indian child for involuntary foster case placement only if the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage or harm to the child. Evidence must show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the home and the likelihood that continued custody of the child will result in serious emotional or physical damage or harm to the particular child who is the subject of the proceeding. Poverty, isolation, custodian age, crowded or inadequate housing, substance use, or nonconforming social behavior does not by itself constitute clear and convincing evidence of imminent serious emotional or physical damage or harm to the child. As soon as the threat has been removed and the child is no longer at risk, the state should terminate the removal, by returning the child to the parent while offering a solution to mitigate the situation that gave rise to the need for emergency removal and placement.

       In considering whether to involuntarily place an Indian child in foster care or to terminate the parental rights of the parent of an Indian child, the court shall require that a qualified expert witness must be qualified to testify regarding whether the child’s continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage or harm to the child and should be qualified to testify as to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child’s tribe. An individual may be designated by the Indian child’s tribe as being qualified to testify to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child’s tribe. The court or any party may request the assistance of the Indian child’s tribe or the bureau of Indian affairs office serving the Indian child’s tribe in locating individuals qualified to serve as expert witnesses. The social worker regularly assigned to the Indian child may not serve as a qualified expert witness in child-custody proceedings concerning the child. The qualified expert witness should be someone familiar with the particular child and have contact with the parents to observe interaction between the parents, child, and extended family members. The child welfare agency and courts should facilitate access to the family and records to facilitate accurate testimony.

Reasonable notice, either oral or written, stating the time, place, and purpose of the shelter care hearing must be given to the child and, if able to be found, to the child’s parents, guardian, or other custodian.

       Before removal of an Indian child from the custody of a parent or Indian custodian for purposes of involuntary foster care placement or the termination of parental rights over an Indian child, the court shall find that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative services designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. The court may not order the removal unless evidence of active efforts shows there has been a vigorous and concerted level of casework beyond the level that would constitute reasonable efforts under section 27-20.3-26. Reasonable efforts may not be construed to be active efforts. Active efforts must be made in a manner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values, conditions, and way of life of the Indian child’s tribe. Active efforts must utilize the available resources of the Indian child’s extended family, tribe, tribal and other relevant social service agencies, and individual Indian caregivers.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-20.1s27-20.3-19ol13">
       The court may order the removal of the Indian child for involuntary foster care placement only if the court determines, by clear and convincing evidence, that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. Evidence must show a causal relationship between the particular conditions in the home and the likelihood that continued custody of the child will result in serious emotional or physical damage to the particular child who is the subject of the proceeding. Poverty, isolation, custodian age, crowded or inadequate housing, substance use, or nonconforming social behavior does not by itself constitute clear and convincing evidence of imminent serious emotional or physical damage to the child. As soon as the threat has been removed and the child is no longer at risk, the state should terminate the removal, by returning the child to the parent while offering a solution to mitigate the situation that gave rise to the need for emergency removal and placement.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-20.1s27-20.3-19ol14">
       The court may only order the termination of parental rights over the Indian child if the court determines, by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-20.1s27-20.3-19ol15">
       In considering whether to involuntarily place an Indian child in foster care or to terminate the parental rights of the parent of an Indian child, the court shall require that a qualified expert witness must be qualified to testify regarding whether the child’s continued custody by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child and should be qualified to testify as to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child’s tribe. An individual may be designated by the Indian child’s tribe as being qualified to testify to the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian child’s tribe. The court or any party may request the assistance of the Indian child’s tribe or the bureau of Indian affairs office serving the Indian child’s tribe in locating individuals qualified to serve as expert witnesses. The social worker regularly assigned to the Indian child may not serve as a qualified expert witness in child-custody proceedings concerning the child. The qualified expert witness should be someone familiar with the particular child and have contact with the parents to observe interaction between the parents, child, and extended family members. The child welfare agency and courts should facilitate access to the family and records to facilitate accurate testimony.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The division of juvenile services is the administrative agency which shall take custody of delinquent and unruly children committed to its care by the juvenile courts. Upon committing a child to the custody of the division of juvenile services, the juvenile court, law enforcement officers, and other public officials shall make available to the division of juvenile services all pertinent data in their possession with respect to the child. Upon taking custody or if authorized by the court prior to receiving custody of a child, the division of juvenile services shall process the child through such diagnostic testing and evaluation programs as may be necessary to determine the treatment and rehabilitation which is in the best interest of the child and in the best interest of the state. In doing so, the division of juvenile services may utilize the psychological, addiction, psychiatric, career and technical education, medical, and other diagnostic and testing services that are available, examine all the pertinent circumstances, and review the reasons for the child’s commitment. Upon completion of the diagnostic testing and evaluation of a child committed to its custody, the division shall make disposition under subsection 1, 2, or 3 and inform the court of its disposition. Upon completion of the diagnostic testing and evaluation of a child not in its custody, the division shall develop and recommend to the juvenile court an individualized treatment and rehabilitation plan for the child. This plan must include recommendations for the disposition of the child as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t27c27-21s27-21-02ol11">
       Placement in the care of the child’s parent, relative, guardian, or in a foster home or suitable private institution licensed by the state for the care or treatment and rehabilitation of children;
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-21s27-21-02ol12">
       Placement in the care of the North Dakota youth correctional center; or
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-21s27-21-02ol13">
       Placement in the care of a career and technical education, training, or other treatment and rehabilitation institution for children or young adults within this state or in another state in the event that adequate facilities for the child’s treatment and rehabilitation are not available within this state and the committing juvenile court concurs in the placement.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c27-21s27-21-02ol14">
       If the division of juvenile services receives any money on behalf of a child committed to its custody and care under this section for child support, payments in excess of foster care maintenance payments, or money received from the social security administration, the division may establish an account for the child and use the money in a manner it determines will serve the best interests of the child, including setting aside any amounts for the child’s future needs or making all or part of the money available to the person responsible for meeting the child’s daily needs to be used for the child’s benefit.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The judicial conduct commission consists of two judges of the district court, one lawyer licensed to practice law in this state, and four citizens who are not judges, retired judges, or lawyers. Members representing the district court must be appointed by their state association and the lawyer member must be appointed by the board of governors of the state bar association of North Dakota. The citizen members must be appointed by the governor. The term of each member is three years. A member may not serve more than two full three-year terms. Membership terminates if a member ceases to hold the position that qualified the member for appointment. A vacancy must be filled by the appointing power for the remainder of the term. Any appointment to fill a vacancy not made within forty-five days after the vacancy occurs or the term of office ends must be made by the supreme court. The commission shall select one of its members as chair.
     </p>
     <p>
      The commission has the power to investigate complaints against any judge in the state and the chair may appoint a hearing panel to conduct hearings concerning the discipline, removal, retirement, or transfer to incapacity inactive status of any judge.

        Before a judge may be censured or removed, charges must be established by clear and convincing evidence. In re Disciplinary Action Against Wilson, 461 N.W.2d 105, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>
        North Dakota Judicial Conduct Commission used the proper definition of “clear and convincing evidence” when it determined that a judge had violated several ethical rules; a standard proffered by the judge had been expressly rejected because it created a burden of proof equivalent to or greater than the “beyond a reasonable doubt” standard. Judicial Conduct Comm. v. McGuire (In re McGuire), 2004 ND 171, 685 N.W.2d 748, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 296</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        Although more appropriate course of action would have been to require notice and a hearing, court did not find that judge’s actions in entering an ex parte N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 60(a) order rose to the level of ethical violation for which he should receive public censure. Record did not demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that judge willfully violated former 3(A)(4), Rules of Judicial Conduct. In re Disciplinary Action Against Wilson, 461 N.W.2d 105, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion procedure, including notice and hearing, may be employed under Rule 60(a), and Supreme Court suggests that in the future to avoid accusations of improper ex parte contacts that notice and hearing procedure be employed. In re Disciplinary Action Against Wilson, 461 N.W.2d 105, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment did not accurately reflect what the judge intended in his findings, conclusions, and order for judgment. Under these circumstances, an ex parte order under N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 60(a) was appropriate to make the judgment speak the truth. In re Disciplinary Action Against Wilson, 461 N.W.2d 105, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Use of N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 60(a) has been upheld but use of N.D.R.Civ.P., Rule 60(b) motion procedure is to be preferred. In re Disciplinary Action Against Wilson, 461 N.W.2d 105, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D. 1990).
