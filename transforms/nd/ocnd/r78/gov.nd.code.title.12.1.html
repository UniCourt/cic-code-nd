        The provisions of subsection 3 of this section giving a defendant in a case arising before, but tried after, the effective date of this title the election of proceeding under it with respect to defenses and circumstances in mitigation did not require the trial judge to notify defendant of his right to make the election, and in a case where defense counsel was clearly aware of, and willing to assert, this right, trial judge’s failure to formally advise defendant of its existence was not reversible error.

        Where, in trial after effective date of this title of case arising before that date, defense counsel objected to instruction on voluntary intoxication on the ground that it stated law no longer in effect after adoption of the new Criminal Code, defendant had made the election, or given the “consent” provided for in subsection 3, to rely on the provisions of the new Code as to defenses and circumstances in mitigation, and its provisions on those issues were controlling.

     <p>
      The general purposes of this title are to establish a system of prohibitions, penalties, and correctional measures to deal with conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably causes or threatens harm to those individual or public interests for which governmental protection is appropriate. To this end, the provisions of this title are intended, and shall be construed, to achieve the following objectives:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-01s12.1-01-02ol11">
       To ensure the public safety through: a. vindication of public norms by the imposition of merited punishment; b. the deterrent influence of the penalties hereinafter provided; c. the rehabilitation of those convicted of violations of this title; and d. such confinement as may be necessary to prevent likely recurrence of serious criminal behavior.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-01s12.1-01-02ol12">
       By definition and grading of offenses, to define the limits and systematize the exercise of discretion in punishment and to give fair warning of what is prohibited and of the consequences of violation.

       No person may be convicted of an offense unless each element of the offense is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. An accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. The fact that the accused has been arrested, confined, or charged with the offense gives rise to no inference of guilt at the accused’s trial. “Element of an offense” means:
       <ol type="a">

      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-01s12.1-01-03ol13">
       Subsection 1 does not apply to any defense which is explicitly designated an “affirmative defense”. An affirmative defense must be proved by the defendant by a preponderance of evidence.

      <li id="t12.1c12.1-01s12.1-01-03ol14">
       When a statute establishes a presumption, it has the following consequences:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t12.1c12.1-01s12.1-01-03ol14a">
         If there is sufficient evidence of the facts which gave rise to the presumption, the presumed fact is deemed sufficiently proved to warrant submission of the issue to a jury unless the court is satisfied that the evidence as a whole clearly negates the presumed fact.
        </li>
        <li id="t12.1c12.1-01s12.1-01-03ol14b">
         In submitting the issue of the existence of the presumed fact to a jury, the court shall charge that, although the evidence as a whole must establish the presumed fact beyond a reasonable doubt, the jury may arrive at that judgment on the basis of the presumption alone, since the law regards the facts giving rise to the presumption as strong evidence of the fact presumed.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-01s12.1-01-03ol15">
       When a statute declares that given facts constitute a prima facie case, proof of such facts warrants submission of a case to the jury with the usual instructions on burden of proof and without additional instructions attributing any special probative force to the facts proved.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Unless it is otherwise provided or the context plainly requires otherwise, if a statute outside this title defining an offense, or a related statute, or a rule or regulation thereunder, contains a provision constituting an exception from criminal liability for conduct which would otherwise be included within the prohibition of the offense, that the defendant came within such exception is a defense.

        Because mistake of law is an affirmative defense, the state had no burden to “negate” the defense beyond a reasonable doubt; rather, defendants had the burden of proving the affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Purdy, 491 N.W.2d 402, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite> (N.D. 1992).

        Entrapment is an affirmative defense under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-11(1) and must be proven by the defendant by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Tester, 1999 ND 60, 592 N.W.2d 515, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant’s offer of proof failed to support his claimed affirmative defense of innocent mistake of facts, the trial court did not err in denying his motion in limine requesting an affirmative defense jury instruction.

        The legislature has defined one variation of the crime of actual physical control while under the influence of intoxicating liquor as the accused having a “alcohol concentration of at least ten one-hundredths of one percent by weight at the time of the performance of a chemical test.” Nothing in that definition shifts the burden of proof to the accused. The prosecution must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Vogel, 467 N.W.2d 86, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        In a trial under N.D.C.C. § 39-08-01, the language of N.D.C.C. § 39-20-07(5) was improperly included in instructions to the jury because it has only to do with the judge’s preliminary function of admitting evidence; it has nothing to do with the jury’s function of weighing the evidence. By telling the jury that the test results were received in evidence when the test was fairly administered, this instruction shifted the burden of disputing the test results to the defendant and violated his right to due process. State v. Vogel, 467 N.W.2d 86, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Improper jury instruction on the defense of lack of criminal responsibility, erroneously placed the burden of proof for an element of the crime upon defendant, rather than upon State, and constituted obvious error warranting a new trial.

        Despite testimony that defendant was profoundly psychotic and suffering from delirium tremens at the time of the murder, the jury could have chosen not to believe the testimony, and the state’s evidence that the defendant changed clothes and washed off the victim’s blood supported the finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Klose, 2003 ND 39, 657 N.W.2d 276, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 31</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        Evidence that defendant presented was not sufficient to establish N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-11 entrapment as an affirmative defense to the charge against defendant of criminal attempt to possess methamphetamine, and, thus, that conviction had to stand. Defendant had the burden of proof of establishing that defense, by a preponderance of the evidence as required by N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-03, and did not do so because the evidence that police offered defendant a good price in order to induce defendant to buy the methamphetamine and arranged for defendant to purchase methamphetamine despite knowing that defendant was a drug addict was not enough to show that police engaged in the necessary “outrageous conduct” that would cause a person who was not ready to commit the crime to commit it.

        District court erred by taking judicial notice of defendant's prior offenses because the court's ability to do so was limited to matters of pleading, defendant's prior convictions constituted an essential element of her charge that the State still had to prove, the court was required to explain the legal effect of its judicial notice to the jury and clarify that satisfaction of the State burden of persuasion remained solely with the jury.

        Compliance with a statute of limitation is not an element of an offense, but rather a jurisdictional fact.

        In a prosecution for violation of a city shoplifting ordinance, the jury instructions, taken as a whole, could not have been understood by reasonable jurors to require them to conclude from the presumed fact, irrespective of other facts causing them to have a reasonable doubt, that the requisite intention of permanently depriving another of the merchandise was present. The qualifying instruction on presumption made it clear to the jury that the presumption was permissive only and that they were allowed to find the element of intent only if the city provided the predicate facts beyond a reasonable doubt.

        A defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on a legal defense if there is evidence to support it. A defense is raised when there is evidence in the case “sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt on the issue,” and it is error if the trial court refuses to instruct on an issue that has been adequately raised.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to deny defendant’s request for an alibi instruction because, even though the State presented defendant’s assertions that defendant was elsewhere at the time of the crime, defendant did not adequately present such a defense pursuant to N.D.R.Crim.P. 12.1.

        By instructing the jury that it had a responsibility to determine if the defendant had presented sufficient evidence to give rise to a reasonable doubt, the court may have confused and misled the jury into believing that defendant carried the burden of proving self defense and excuse by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The instructions should have merely stated that there was evidence of self defense and excuse and that the state had a duty to negate those defenses by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. State v.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of simple assault-domestic violence because he caused bodily injury to a victim; although the victim testified that she did not feel any pain, it was a matter of common experience and understanding that was left to the jury. A reporting witness testified to seeing defendant strike the alleged victim repeatedly in the upper body, and defendant had a fresh laceration on his arm after the alleged assault; moreover, officers testified that it was not uncommon to investigate assaults where there was no indication of physical injury.

        Child abuse statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the statute’s reference to bodily injury as defined in another statute gave sufficient notice to those charged with enforcing the law and put a reasonable person on adequate notice as to what conduct was proscribed as constituting child abuse.

        Defendant’s acquittal of aggravated assault did not bar restitution because (1) defendant was only acquitted of causing a victim’s unconsciousness, and (2) defendant assault conviction was sufficient to support a restitution award.

        Defendant’s conviction for aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon was proper because the jury could have reasonably found that defendant used a vehicle as a dangerous weapon under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04(6); defendant intentionally drove a vehicle forward while the victim backpedaled. Defendant continued forward after the victim fell and both the front and rear tire of defendant’s vehicle went over the victim. State v. Vetter, 2013 ND 4, 826 N.W.2d 334, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 2013).

       <p>
        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident involving injury and aggravated reckless driving, defendant’s sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing as the district court substantially relied upon an impermissible factor in sentencing defendant to jail because the case did not implicate an offense involving domestic violence, sexual offender registration, or mandatory terms of incarceration; defendant was not charged with, nor did he plead guilty to, any offense involving a dangerous weapon; and the dangerous weapon exception to the presumptive probation statute did not apply in defendant’s case.
   State v. Christensen, 2019 ND 11, 921 N.W.2d 436, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        The general definition of the term “explosives” as contained in subsection (8) should be applied to ascertain the meaning of the term “explosives” in section 62.1-02-11, since there is no definition provided in Title 62.1.

       <p>
        Where, in a prosecution for gross sexual imposition, the court refused a jury request for a definition of the term “force” which is defined by subsection 11, error was committed, but the error was harmless where counsel did not bring the definition to the court’s attention nor object to the answer which was given, and there was substantial evidence to support the conviction. State v. Smuda, 419 N.W.2d 166, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not commit obvious error by not including a jury instruction on self-defense during defendant’s trial for disorderly conduct because without a showing of physical action upon another person, as defined in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04(11), the failure to instruct the jury on self-defense was not error, let alone obvious error.
   State v. Gresz, 2006 ND 135, 717 N.W.2d 583, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 2006).

        The serious nature of sexual assault is underscored by the North Dakota legislature classifying them as class AA felonies, carrying a potential sentence of life imprisonment without parole under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-20-03(3)(a) and 12.1-32-01(1). The North Dakota legislature has defined force to mean physical action in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04(11), and it is the force or physical action by defendant which must compel the victim to submit to a sex act for a crime to be committed under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(a); in the absence of force or threats of death or serious bodily injury, there is no crime under § 12.1-20-03(1)(a).

        Where the same evidence from which a juror could infer that the defendant aided another with intent that the other commit an offense (accomplice liability) could also allow a juror to infer that she only aided another with knowledge that the other intended to commit an offense (facilitation), there was evidence which could create a reasonable doubt as to accomplice liability and support a conviction of criminal facilitation, and the trial court’s refusal to give a lesser included offense instruction constituted prejudicial error. State v. Langan, 410 N.W.2d 149, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 368</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>

        A defendant seeking a lesser included offense instruction must show (1) that the offense is a lesser included offense of the crime charged; and (2) that there is evidence which creates a reasonable doubt as to the greater offense, but supports a conviction of the lesser offense beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. McKing, 1999 ND 81, 593 N.W.2d 342, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Where defendant was charged with attempted murder for his involvement in a police shoot-out, the trial court properly denied his requested instruction on reckless endangerment as an included offense. A person can be convicted of attempted murder for having taken a substantial step toward commission of the crime of murder even if there never was a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or death to another as required for reckless endangerment; in this case, defendant was properly convicted of both offenses for firing shots at police officers.

        N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 precluded the City of Fargo, North Dakota, a home rule city, from imposing fees for noncriminal traffic offenses that exceeded the limits set forth for equivalent violations in N.D.C.C. § 39-06.1-06, because N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 clearly and unambiguously precludes a home rule city from superseding criminal or noncriminal offenses defined by State law, when a penalty that exceeds the limits delineated by equivalent State law supersedes State law; the word “offense” rather than the word “crimes” is used in the text of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05, and an “offense” under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-05 includes noncriminal, as well as criminal offenses.

        District court abused its discretion by misapplying or misinterpreting the law when it sentenced defendant for conspiracy to commit kidnapping as a dangerous special offender because his previous child abuse offense was not a similar offense in terms of its elements or its underlying conduct; in the child abuse offense, defendant injured his infant son, but his conduct in the conspiracy to commit kidnapping offense did not cause physical injury to the victim’s baby.

        The meaning of “peace officer,” as explained in subdivision 17 of this section, applied to former N.D.C.C. ch. 12-62. Under former N.D.C.C. § 12-62-08 (see now N.D.C.C. ch. 12-63) training was mandatory for any “public servant authorized…to enforce the law and to conduct or engage in investigations or prosecutions for violations of law.” This definition certainly included law enforcement officers, other than detectives, without excluding those engaged in jail or detention work.

        During a traffic stop, a police officer made a passenger stand outside after midnight in freezing cold weather and refused to allow him to sit in the officer’s car; the passenger was later treated for frostbite. The evidence was sufficient to support the police officer’s conviction for reckless endangerment in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-03; by refusing to allow the passenger to sit in his squad car, he created a substantial risk of bodily injury under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04(29).

        Reasoning mind reasonably could determine the Department of Human Services finding that the father willfully inflicted an impairment of physical condition, including physical pain, upon the child was proven by the weight of the evidence from the entire record as there was evidence that the father struck the child approximately 24 times over a two-hour period with a wooden backscratcher, and although administered through a pair of pants and a diaper, the force of the spankings caused two large purple bruises the size of fifty-cent pieces on the child’s buttocks; there was evidence, including admissions from the father, that the child cried each time he was spanked and that the spankings were causing pain to the child.

        Father failed to clearly demonstrate that the child abuse statutes were unconstitutionally vague and contravened the federal or state constitution; the statute need not set out in explicit detail all possible factual scenarios that would fall within its reach; it need only give adequate and fair warning, when measured by the common understanding and practice of a “reasonable person,” of the proscribed conduct.

        Defendant’s conviction for menacing was supported by the evidence because the record revealed that during an encounter with police officers, defendant threatened to “kick their ass” and “put them in the hospital,” and he took at least one step toward the officers before one officer subdued him; defendant’s statements to the officers denoted sufficient imminency of serious bodily injury under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04(29).

        District court did not err in using the definitions of “serious bodily injury” and “substantial bodily injury” from N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04 in addressing defendant's constitutional arguments in his motions to dismiss; given the established definitions of “serious bodily injury” and “substantial bodily injury,” along with other courts' holdings regarding the phrases, § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.39.html#t39c39-08s39-08-01" target="_blank">39-08-01</a></cite>.2(2) is not unconstitutionally vague.

        It was reasonable for the jury to find defendant guilty of aggravated assault because the testimony that his wife felt as though she was going to pass out, along with a doctor’s testimony that her injuries were consistent with strangulation, constituted “serious bodily injury”; the testimony stating defendant intentionally put his wife in a choke hold satisfied the requirement that the conduct be “willful.” State v.

       <p>
        Defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal was properly denied because the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction for aggravated assault as he willfully caused serious bodily injury to the victim because the victim testified that defendant strangled her; her testimony alone was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction; and the State introduced pictures of the victim showing bruising around her neck, and the emergency room doctor testified the bruising could have been caused by strangulation.

        District court did not commit error in failing to give an instruction on culpability, since culpability is a non-essential element of DUI because DUI is a strict liability offense. State v. Glass, 2000 ND 212, 620 N.W.2d 146, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 259</cite> (N.D. 2000).

        In a statutory rape prosecution, the culpability requirement of “willfully” did not apply to the element of the victim's age, under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-02-02(3)(a), because the crime was a strict liability crime, since lack of knowledge or mistake as to the victim’s age was not a defense, under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-01(1). State v. Vandermeer, 2014 ND 46, 843 N.W.2d 686, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        Although this section may be directly applicable only to offenses or crimes described in Title 12.1, it was an appropriate source to look to in determining the definition of “intent” in section 57-38-45(3). State v. Benson, 376 N.W.2d 36, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 460</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Defendant’s conviction for attempted murder of a prosecutor was supported by the evidence because the jury heard evidence that defendant brought a loaded gun and three clips with 38 rounds of ammunition into a courtroom, stood in a “shooter’s stance” with two hands holding the gun pointed at the prosecutor’s chest, and intentionally, as defined in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-02-02(1)(a), pulled the trigger multiple times.

        District court correctly instructed the jury on the culpability required for criminal attempt and correctly advised the jury of the law because the jury instructions followed the wording of the criminal attempt statute and also defined “accomplice,” which mirrored the text of the accomplice statute.

       </p>

        Evidence was sufficient to sustain a criminal trespass conviction where defendant admitted that he received the divorce decree, which awarded his ex-wife the parties’
   home, the ex-wife testified that she informed defendant that he could not come to the house without her approval, and defendant admitted that he had been told not to come to the house without her approval. The ex-wife testified that she did not receive a phone call from defendant, but awoke and discovered him in her residence, and defendant admitted that he entered the house through the window.

       <p>
        It is not necessary to show that defendant realized her conduct would in all probability produce death in order to establish that death was negligently caused; negligent conduct requires only showing of an unreasonable disregard of a substantial likelihood of existence of relevant facts or risks. State v. Ohnstad, 359 N.W.2d 827, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 435</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case involving leaving the scene of an accident involving death under N.D.C.C. § 39-08-04, a motion for an acquittal under N.D.R.Crim.P. 29 was properly denied because an argument that defendant was not aware he had hit someone did not apply the negligence culpability standard under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-02-02; based on the age of a truck and problems that it was having, defendant should have at least gotten out and checked after he felt a bump while backing out of a parking lot near a bar. A witnesses’
   testimony regarding the amount of time defendant spent around his truck made the jury’s conclusion that defendant acted negligently by leaving the scene even more reasonable because it seemed more likely he would have known a drunk man was in the vicinity and could have been the source of the bump, even if he did not think the man was behind the truck when he backed up.
   State v. Jacob, 2006 ND 246, 724 N.W.2d 118, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 2006).

        When the police conducted a traffic stop after midnight during freezing temperatures, they directed the passenger to exit the vehicle and denied his request to sit in the squad car; he suffered frostbite. The evidence was sufficient to support the police officer’s conviction for reckless endangerment in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-03; he did not challenge the jury’s findings that he acted recklessly within the meaning of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-02-02(1)(c).

        A person acts “‘Willfully’ if he engages in the conduct intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.” Negligent conduct does not constitute willful conduct. State v. Anderson, 480 N.W.2d 727, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>

        It was reasonable for the jury to find defendant guilty of aggravated assault because the testimony that his wife felt as though she was going to pass out, along with a doctor’s testimony that her injuries were consistent with strangulation, constituted “serious bodily injury"; the testimony stating defendant intentionally put his wife in a choke hold satisfied the requirement that the conduct be “willful.”State v. Abdiwali Mohamud, 2019 ND 101, 925 N.W.2d 396, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the defendant was guilty of disobeying a lawful preliminary injunction where the defendant evidenced knowledge of the injunction by her initial lawful demonstration, by her response to a warning, and by her testimony, where there was ample evidence that the defendant was part of a group that demonstrated other than quietly and peacefully, and where there were evidentiary conflicts and factual questions about the defendant’s state of mind sufficient for the jury to infer a willfulness to violate the injunction.

Section 29-21-14 requires corroboration of testimony only where the witness could be criminally responsible as an accomplice under subsection 1 of this section. State v.

        Where witness and defendant were the only eyewitnesses to murder and each claimed that the other, acting alone, killed the victim, it would have been very misleading to the jury had the court given the jury an instruction to the effect that testimony of an accomplice must be corroborated; even if it were assumed that the trial court erred in not giving such an instruction, the failure to give it under the facts of the case would have been harmless error.

        Where all the material elements of the crime of accomplice to burglary were established by testimony of defendant’s accomplice, and his testimony was adequately corroborated by direct testimony of others and by the introduction of various physical evidence seized from vehicle pursuant to a search warrant, there was substantial evidence to support the jury’s verdict that defendant acted as an accomplice to burglary.

        Evidence, including that a second defendant induced a first defendant before the murders with accusation that the victims were abusing a child and with motives of visitation and a trust fund, was sufficient to convict the second defendant of two counts of accomplice to the murders under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-03-01(1)(b).

        Substantial evidence warranted defendant’s conviction for attempted gross sexual imposition because the State presented sufficient evidence of who the victim would be were the crime committed by her accomplice, who defendant communicated with on a social networking website; a detective testified that part of the conversation between defendant and the accomplice was role-playing, but the part in which defendant instructed the accomplice to sexually assault his daughter was not.

        Where the same evidence from which a juror could infer that the defendant aided another with intent that the other commit an offense (accomplice liability) could also allow a juror to infer that she only aided another with knowledge that the other intended to commit an offense (facilitation), there was evidence which could create a reasonable doubt as to accomplice liability and support a conviction of criminal facilitation, and the trial court’s refusal to give a lesser included offense instruction constituted prejudicial error.

        Evidence that defendant was present at the scene of the crime and did not attempt to prevent the crime was insufficient to establish the defendant as an accomplice where there was no evidence that defendant commanded, induced, procured, aided and abetted, or encouraged the commission of the crime.

       A verdict finding the defendant guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon was proper if it appeared that he aided and abetted accomplices who used dangerous weapons. State v. Rosencranz, 40 N.D. 93, 168 N.W. 650, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1918).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that the defendant suggested a plan contemplating the larceny of an automobile was sufficient under the statute, and he was not exonerated because he did not advise the stealing of a particular car or in detail direct the execution of the scheme. State v. Smith, 51 N.D. 130, 199 N.W. 187, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1924).

       Where four defendants, charged with assault and battery, admitted they traveled together, arrived at scene of assault together, were present while fighting between them and occupants of house was going on, and acted in support of each other, none of them doing anything to stop fighting, there was ample evidence that all of defendants aided and abetted in commission of the battery, and conviction was affirmed. State v. Berger, 235 N.W.2d 254, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 142</cite> (N.D. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 913, 96 S. Ct. 1511, 47 L. Ed. 2d 764, 1976 U.S. LEXIS 880 (U.S. 1976).

       In a prosecution for a larceny, where the defendant was held as the principal on the theory that he advised and encouraged the commission of the crime, an instruction that possession of property recently stolen, unless explained, was a circumstance tending to show guilt was proper.
   State v. Smith, 51 N.D. 130, 199 N.W. 187, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite> (N.D. 1924).

      </p>
      <p>
       It was proper to charge as principal in a homicide one who counseled and directed the murder and the information could aver that defendant himself fired the fatal shot, which was in fact fired by the one he instigated to commit the crime. State v. Kent, 4 N.D. 577, 62 N.W. 631, 1895 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1895).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was no evidence proving that defendant was a principal in the crime of maintaining a common nuisance, it was prejudicial error to instruct the jury that they might convict the defendant upon the theory that he aided and abetted another in keeping and maintaining the nuisance.

        Although there was evidence defendant was less than fourteen years old when the first alleged sexual acts or contacts occurred, evidence also existed that all essential elements of the offense were not present and complete and the offense was not committed until after defendant’s fourteenth birthday; defendant was only charged with one offense, continuous sexual abuse of a child, and he was not charged with separate offenses for each of the alleged sexual acts or contacts, and the offense of continuous sexual abuse of a child was not committed until defendant was more than fourteen years old, such that N.D.C.C. § 12.1-04-01 did not apply.

        Trial court did not commit reversible error by combining language from former and present intoxication statutes in its instruction on the effect of intoxication on defendant’s capacity to form the requisite specific intent required by the charged offense where the changes in the statutes did not alter the substance of the law and the instruction as given fairly informed the jury of the current law.

        The essence of the ability to consult with an attorney with a reasonable degree of rational understanding is that the defendant must be able to confer coherently with counsel and provide necessary and relevant information to formulate a defense. Where there was evidence that defendant had a “normal” or “mid average” I.Q. and a basic understanding of the legal process and the role of each of the participants in the proceedings, and there was conflicting evidence about whether he was able to communicate with counsel with a reasonable degree of rational understanding so as to assist his counsel in formulating a defense, since the trial court was in the best position to weigh that conflicting evidence, although defendant undoubtedly had some mental deficiencies, the trial court did not err in finding that defendant could effectively communicate with counsel to assist in his defense.

        Defendant did not carry defendant’s burden of proof to show that defendant was entitled to relief on defendant’s application for postconviction relief. Defendant did not do so because defendant did not introduce sufficient evidence to support defendant’s claims that defendant was not competent, as contemplated by N.D.C.C. § 12.1-04-04, to enter a guilty plea to two criminal charges or that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel in entering that plea, and the trial court’s finding that defendant did not adequately support either postconviction claim was not clearly erroneous under N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a).

        Defendant, who was convicted of two counts of terrorizing, was not denied due process of law during his trial, even though the trial court did not order a second evaluation and order a competency hearing on its own motion, where two experts agreed that defendant was competent to stand trial, although they also warned that defendant would be difficult to work with, which the record reflected he was. State v. Roberson, 2002 ND 24, 639 N.W.2d 690, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 17</cite> (N.D. 2002).

       <p>
        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to gross sexual imposition, burglary, aggravated assault, and terrorizing, the district court did not commit obvious error by failing to determine whether defendant was competent to proceed because the examiner filed a report containing findings that defendant was competent to proceed and that there was no reason to believe defendant lacked the capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his defense; defendant did not object to the report or otherwise contest the examiner’s findings; and no clear statutory provisions or case law required the district court to make a determination about defendant’s competency under those circumstances.

         Incompetent to Stand Trial.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A defendant is incompetent to stand trial when he neither has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, nor a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him. State v. Heger, 326 N.W.2d 855, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 374</cite> (N.D. 1982); State v. VanNatta, 506 N.W.2d 63, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 165</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though defendant presented surprise testimony at trial, failed to understand his defense, testified in the form of a long narrative and alternatively complained of and praised his attorney, these facts and circumstances were not enough to create sufficient doubt in the court’s mind regarding the defendant’s competency to stand trial. Thus, defendant was not denied due process when trial court failed to hold an evidentiary hearing on his competency to stand trial. State v. Gleeson, 2000 ND 205, 619 N.W.2d 858, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 250</cite> (N.D. 2000).

     <p>
      Whenever there is reason to doubt the defendant’s fitness to proceed, the court may order temporary detention of the defendant for the purpose of an examination. The temporary detention must be in the least restrictive appropriate setting, including the state hospital, the life skills and transition center, or other suitable facility for a reasonable period, not to exceed thirty days, for such examination. In lieu of detention, the court may allow the defendant to remain in the defendant’s present residential setting or other suitable residential setting for the purpose of examination, subject to any reasonable limitation the court may impose. A human service center may be considered if the court is aware an inquiry was made before the court ordered the evaluation to ensure appropriate resources exist at the human service center being ordered to conduct the examination. While the defendant is detained, the defendant’s legal counsel, family, and others necessary to assist in the defendant’s case must have reasonable opportunity to examine and confer with the defendant.

         Competency to Stand Trial.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant is initially presumed competent to stand trial until the trial court has reason to doubt defendant’s competency; once a defendant has caused the trial court to doubt his competency to proceed, the state has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant is competent to stand trial. State v. Heger, 326 N.W.2d 855, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 374</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to gross sexual imposition, burglary, aggravated assault, and terrorizing, the district court did not commit obvious error by failing to determine whether defendant was competent to proceed because the examiner filed a report containing findings that defendant was competent to proceed and that there was no reason to believe defendant lacked the capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his defense; defendant did not object to the report or otherwise contest the examiner’s findings; and no clear statutory provisions or case law required the district court to make a determination about defendant’s competency under those circumstances. State v. Grant, 2018 ND 175, 915 N.W.2d 639, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s constitutional public trial guarantee by the trial court’s closure of the courtroom during defendant’s competency hearing was violated because the right attached to a pretrial competency hearing and the trial court did not apply the Waller factors. Even though defendant requested the closure he articulated no overriding interest and the trial court did not tailor the closure to any overriding interest likely to be prejudiced, nor did it consider alternatives to closure. State v. Rogers, 2018 ND 244, 919 N.W.2d 193, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        Evidence regarding a defendant’s competency to stand trial may be presented in the form of lay observations and expert medical testimony. State v. Heger, 326 N.W.2d 855, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 374</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining defendant’s competency to stand trial, it is appropriate for the trial judge to personally conduct an informal examination of the defendant and then to rely, in part, on his own impressions, observations and conclusions in making his decision. State v. Heger, 326 N.W.2d 855, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 374</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s determination that mentally retarded defendant was competent to stand trial was not clearly erroneous where, despite defendant’s mental condition, there was evidence that he could understand the legal concepts and proceedings against him if they were explained, to him in very basic, simple language at the vocabulary level of a six-year-old child, and that his understanding would be sufficient to enable him to assist counsel in his defense.

      <p>
       Where district court retained jurisdiction over petitioner’s placement in state hospital as provided for by subsection (2), supreme court would not consider collateral attack on court order alleging violation of petitioner’s due process rights, based on opinion of assistant attorney general that involuntary commitment proceeding should be conducted. Rutten v. R. A. (In the Interest of R. A.), 551 N.W.2d 800, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court did not clearly err in finding that defendant was not competent to assist in his defense and suspending the prosecution against him as the report filed by an independent examiner, in conjunction with the testimony and evidence presented at two hearings and the district court’s own observations, provided evidence to support its findings that defendant was not competent to stand trial because of his schizophrenia, paranoid type, and delusions as well as his emotional outbursts and instability during hearings. State v. Holbach, 2014 ND 14, 842 N.W.2d 328, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 984, 135 S. Ct. 462, 190 L. Ed. 2d 347, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 7253 (U.S. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because defendant had a right to a speedy trial and was presumed innocent, his continued pretrial detention at the State Hospital had to be determined under the statutory procedures and safeguards of N.D.C.C. ch. 25-03.1. State v. Holbach, 2014 ND 14, 842 N.W.2d 328, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 16</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 984, 135 S. Ct. 462, 190 L. Ed. 2d 347, 2014 U.S. LEXIS 7253 (U.S. 2014).

       District court did not err in denying appellant’s application for post-conviction relief, because he failed to prove that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to request a bifurcated trial under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-04.1-16 on the issue of commission of the alleged offenses of reckless endangerment and attempted murder, and a separate trial for the lack of criminal responsibility by reason of mental disease or defect. Appellant did not have the right to have a separate trial on the issue of lack of criminal responsibility; rather, bifurcation is allowed in the trial court’s discretion.

        Under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-04.1-25(5)(a), if the district court found there was not a substantial risk the individual would commit a crime as the result of mental illness, the individual had to be discharged. State v. Davis, 2016 ND 145, 882 N.W.2d 281, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 2016).

       <p>
        Plain language in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-04.1-25(5)(b) that it may modify the conditions of release as appropriate for the protection of society afforded the district court discretion to consider the circumstances and all relevant factors in determining whether to modify its order for conditional release. State v. Davis, 2016 ND 145, 882 N.W.2d 281, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-04.1-22, 12.1-04.1-24, and 12.1-04.1-25 require the discharge of an individual if the court finds the individual is not mentally ill or defective or that there is not a substantial risk, as a result of a mental illness or defect, that the individual will commit a criminal act. N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-04.1-22(4)(a), 12.1-04.1-24(3)(a), 12.1-04.1-25(5)(a). All three sections also contemplate an individual committed may pose various levels of risk to society and grants the district court discretion to order the individual to varying levels of care, from commitment at a treatment facility, to supervision and treatment, or to treatment without supervision, depending on the risks found. N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-04.1-22(4)(b)-(c), 12.1-04.1-24(3)(b)-(c), 12.1-04.1-25(5)(b)-(c). State v. Davis, 2016 ND 145, 882 N.W.2d 281, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        While the history of the legislative development of justification defenses in our state shows that this chapter “is not intended to preclude the judicial development of other justifications,” it is clear that our criminal code does not license the judicial extension of justification to any individualized conception of “necessity.” State v.

        Prosecution for “terrorizing” as defined by N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-17-04 was a prosecution for recklessness, because N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-17-04 does not specify the degree of culpability required and, therefore, the degree required is “willfully” under N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-02-02, subsection (2), and because “willfully” includes “recklessly” under N.D.C.C. §

       Although N.D.C.C. § 5-01-08 prohibits persons under 21 years of age from purchasing alcohol, attempting to purchase alcohol, and entering premises where alcoholic beverages are sold, law enforcement officials do not violate the law when conducting compliance checks because N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-02(4) gives law enforcement officials the authority to use persons under 21 years of age for this purpose.

        This section applies to conduct, and is not limited to specified offenses; thus if a person is justified in engaging in specific conduct that would otherwise constitute disorderly conduct, self-defense is a defense. State v. Schumaier, 1999 ND 239, 603 N.W.2d 882, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>
        Where Defendant was convicted of injuring a highway, a trial court did not err in denying defendant’s instruction on the defense of excuse because the justifications found in N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-05-03 and 12.1-05-06 and the definition of “force” in N.D.C.C. ch. 12.1-05 contemplated taking action against another person, rather than against property.

        The trial court erred in ruling that defendant’s proffered testimony of deceased’s statement, that the victim contemplated arming himself and coming after the defendant, was hearsay; such evidence was not offered to prove the truth of the matter but to show the defendant’s state of mind. State v. Hart, 1997 ND 188, 569 N.W.2d 451, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 1997).

       <p>
        District court erred in excluding evidence about threatening statements the victim allegedly made to defendant, and the error was not harmless because the exclusion of the evidence harmed defendant’s ability to present his defense and affected his substantial rights; defendant alleged he was acting in self-defense, and evidence about his state of mind was relevant and material to his defense

        Resistance to “excessive force” by an officer acting under color of law is a factual defense to any criminal charge arising from the resistance. State v. Ritter, 472 N.W.2d 444, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court implicitly rejected defendant’s assertion that his resistance to arrest was justified by excessive force under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-03(1) where the court properly considered whether excessive force was used as a question of fact and by finding defendant guilty of preventing arrest or discharge of other duties, in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-02(1); the court was not required to make a specific finding of fact on the issue of excessive force.

        Where self-defense and defense of others were the defendant’s primary defenses to the simple assault charge, the trial court’s refusal to give the instructions constituted reversible error under N.D.R.Crim.P. 52(a). State v. Thiel, 411 N.W.2d 66, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 364</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant was entitled to the instructions on self-defense and defense of another, although he refused to unequivocably admit striking the victim. State v. Thiel, 411 N.W.2d 66, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 364</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not commit obvious error by not including a jury instruction on self-defense during defendant’s trial for disorderly conduct because, without a showing of physical action upon another person, the failure to instruct the jury on self-defense was not error, let alone obvious error.
   State v. Gresz, 2006 ND 135, 717 N.W.2d 583, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>
        Where a victim testified that she was injured only after attacking defendant, a self-defense instruction under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-03 should have been given, even if defendant was the initial aggressor when he pushed in a bathroom door; the force used by the victim had to be clearly excessive. The victim testified at trial that she followed defendant out of the bathroom and struck him in the head with a large metal rod.

        Victim’s prior assault of defendant and the victim’s previous “implied threat” with a handgun did not support defendant’s theory of self-defense where, at the time of the incident in which defendant shot the victim, defendant was not in danger of imminent unlawful bodily injury and he could have safely retreated without using the rifle. Sampson v. State, 506 N.W.2d 722, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1993), overruled in part, Whiteman v. State, 2002 ND 77, 643 N.W.2d 704, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Finder of fact is required to use a subjective standard and view circumstances attending an accused’s use of force from standpoint of accused, and not from standpoint of what a reasonably cautious person might or might not do or consider necessary to do under like circumstances, to determine if the circumstances are sufficient to create in accused’s mind an honest and reasonable belief that use of force was necessary to protect himself from imminent harm. State v. Leidholm, 334 N.W.2d 811, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 296</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of aggravated assault because, although he asserted that there was no attempt, intent, or readiness to inflict serious bodily injury, the jury was permitted to draw its own inferences regarding defendant’s intent in using the beer bottle as a weapon and whether striking the other individual’s face with it causing a serious cut was reasonable self-defense based on defendant’s injuries sustained in the fight.

       <p>
        Unlawful official conduct is not an absolute defense to a preventing-arrest charge, and the law permits a defendant to resist only “excessive force” used to effect an arrest. The question of the reasonableness of the defendant’s conduct in resisting an unlawful arrest is properly determined by the jury upon all of the facts. State v. Cox, 532 N.W.2d 384, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of preventing arrest and related offenses after the jury received instructions on self-defense, the verdict had to be interpreted as finding that the officers did not use excessive force and that defendant was not justified under N.D.C.C. {/n 12.1-05-03(1) in using force to resist the arrest.

       On a plea of self-defense the question whether a defendant was, or in good faith believed himself to be, in such imminent danger that he was justified in using force to protect himself and the further question of whether the force he used was greater than the circumstances of the case warranted were questions for the jury.

        Under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-05(1), reasonable force used to safeguard or promote the child’s welfare, including punishment and discipline, may not provide the basis for a finding that a child was an abused child under N.D.C.C. § 50-25.1-02(3); the father failed to clearly demonstrate that the child abuse statutes were unconstitutionally overbroad.

        Reasoning mind reasonably could determine the Department of Human Services’
   finding that the force the father used was not reasonable force was proven by the weight of the evidence from the entire record; his use of force was therefore not justified under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-05(1) and did not preclude a finding that the child was an abused child under N.D.C.C. § 50-25.1-02(3).

        Trial court did not err in finding that a mother had not committed domestic violence by spanking and slapping her child across the face; the child protection service assessment report indicated neither parent abused or engaged in any inappropriate behavior with the child and no services were recommended and the mother stated that sometimes the child was spanked or tapped lightly on the face for discipline.

       <p>
        District court did not err in denying a father’s motion to modify custody because a single altercation in which the mother took the son’s cell phone away from him in disciplining him was an isolated incident that did not amount to domestic violence sufficient to constitute a material change of circumstances under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.14.html#t14c14-09s14-09-06" target="_blank">14-09-06</a></cite>.6(6).

   N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-05(1) was not an exclusive listing and other degrees of force could be found to constitute unreasonable force.

        In a prosecution for terrorizing, the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury on defense of premises under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-06; defendant’s use of force to terminate a trespass could arguably have been justified if, before his threatening actions, he told the operators to leave his home, but instead they refused and remained, demanding further identification. This action arguably created a trespass in defendant’s home, and following the victims’
   failure to leave as requested, defendant could possibly have been justified in his use of force to terminate this alleged trespass.

        District court did not err in failing to give defendant’s requested jury instruction on defense of premises and property because the victim was a cotenant, and there was no evidence he unlawfully entered the apartment or was trespassing; simply because an individual may have an expectation of privacy in a place for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, does not mean the individual has the ability to exclude all others from that place or that another’s entry into that place constitutes trespassing.

An individual seeking to protect another individual must, before using deadly force, try to cause the other individual to retreat, or otherwise comply with the requirements of this provision, if safety can be obtained thereby. However, the duty to retreat or avoid force does not apply under the following circumstances:

       <p>
        Subject to exception involving a person’s dwelling or place of work, use of deadly force by an actor in self-defense is not justified if a retreat from assailant can be accomplished with safety to actor and others; whether or not actor could not retreat safely is determined by considering whether or not actor honestly and reasonably believed that he could not retreat from his attacker with safety.

        Victim’s prior assault of defendant and the victim’s previous “implied threat” with a handgun did not support defendant’s theory of self-defense where, at the time of the incident in which defendant shot the victim, defendant was not in danger of imminent unlawful bodily injury and he could have safely retreated without using the rifle.

        Burden on Defendant.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumstances had to be disclosed by the evidence tending to show justification or excuse, and where the state’s case did not disclose such circumstances, the burden devolved upon the defendant to disclose the same. State v. Hazlett, 16 N.D. 426, 113 N.W. 374, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D. 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the proof on the part of the prosecution tended to show that the defendant’s act was excusable or justifiable, there was no burden cast upon the defendant of proving anything. State v. Hazlett, 16 N.D. 426, 113 N.W. 374, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D. 1907).
      </p>
      <p>
       The burden never shifted to the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence either facts and circumstances in mitigation or excuse, or facts establishing an affirmative defense. State v. Hazlett, 16 N.D. 426, 113 N.W. 374, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D. 1907).

       Where defendant was charged with assault and battery with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, it was the duty of the state to prove that there was no justification or excuse in law. State v. Hoerner, 55 N.D. 761, 215 N.W. 277, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1927).

       If the evidence was not before the court on appeal, it would assume that the omission to instruct as to excuses or mitigation of the offense was error. State v. Woods, 24 N.D. 156, 139 N.W. 321, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1912).

         Overt Act.

        Defendant claiming self-defense had to show that deceased, at or before the start of the trouble, on the day the homicide was committed, did some overt act which indicated a present purpose on the part of the deceased to do immediate and great bodily harm to the defendant. State v. Lehman, 44 N.D. 572, 175 N.W. 736, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 223</cite> (N.D. 1919).

        The arrest and return of an escapee was not an arrest for the crime of escape, but a recapture under the direction of the warden for purposes of former statute allowing pursuer to break into a dwelling to retake an escaped prisoner.

        Where defendant was convicted of injuring a highway, a trial court did not err in denying defendant’s instruction on the defense of excuse because the justifications found in N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-05-03 and 12.1-05-06 and the definition of “force” in N.D.C.C. ch. 12.1-05 contemplated taking action against another person, rather than against property.

        Defendant did not claim his conduct was necessary and appropriate for any purpose which would establish a justification or excuse recognized under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-08, and moreover, defendant did not have to hunt until he had replacement tags or he could have tagged the deer immediately using the gratis tag he had in his possession; there was no evidence that defendant’s failure to immediately tag the deer was necessary or appropriate, and the evidence did not support an excuse instruction, and the district court did not err in refusing to give the requested jury instruction.

        Under this section, if the belief is negligently or recklessly held, it is not an excuse in a prosecution for an offense for which negligence or recklessness, as the case may be, suffices to establish culpability. As N.D.C.C. §

Thus, driver who was at least negligent in not stopping to determine whether she had in fact struck another vehicle was not entitled to the defense of excuse based on lack of knowledge. State v.

        Defendant was properly prohibited from arguing a mistake of law defense under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-09 because his offense of possession of a firearm by a felon under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01(2) was a strict liability offense. Defendant’s prior sentence for issuing a check without sufficient funds was not illegal because the district court only addressed the conditions of probation under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-07 and did not address whether defendant could possess or own a firearm after probation. N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01 explicitly prohibited defendant from possessing firearms after he had been convicted of a felony reduced to a misdemeanor under N.D.C.C.§ 12.1-32-02(9) and defendant was presumed to know the law and could not claim that the prohibition did not apply to him.

       <p>
        An affirmative defense under this section is available for driving under suspension when the compulsion is from life-threatening forces of nature. State v. Rasmussen, 524 N.W.2d 843, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant felt compelled to drive due to instructions from the police, and defendant then drove while under suspension, the affirmative defense of compulsion did not apply because defendant had a reasonable opportunity to pursue other alternatives. City of Bismarck v. Lembke, 540 N.W.2d 155, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>
        In a criminal contempt case arising from a visitation dispute, defendant was not entitled to jury instructions on the affirmative defenses of duress and entrapment because there was insufficient evidence to support the instructions; defendant conceded a lack of evidence to support an entrapment defense, and he did not present evidence of threats or assaults to support a duress defense under N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-05-10(1). State v. Stockert, 2004 ND 146, 684 N.W.2d 605, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 276</cite> (N.D. 2004).

       The duress which, under former N.D.C.C. §
   12-05-04, excused acts otherwise criminal, was that such as would induce a well-founded fear of immediate great bodily harm or death; defendant in a robbery prosecution was not excused by the “duress” of his financial circumstances, which made him need money to provide his family with food and shelter.

       A law enforcement agent perpetrates an entrapment if, for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of a crime, the law enforcement agent induces or encourages and, as a direct result, causes another person to engage in conduct constituting such a crime by employing methods of persuasion or inducement which create a substantial risk that such crime will be committed by a person other than one who is ready to commit it. Conduct merely affording a person an opportunity to commit an offense does not constitute entrapment.

        Defendant has the burden to prove the defense of entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence, and this requirement does not violate defendant’s right to due process. State v. Pfister, 264 N.W.2d 694, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1978); State v. Hoffman, 291 N.W.2d 430, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1980).

       <p>
        The affirmative defense of entrapment requires the defendant to prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the law enforcement agent induced the commission of a crime and the method of inducement was likely to cause normally law-abiding persons to commit the offense. City of Mandan v. Willman, 439 N.W.2d 92, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        Defendant who was charged with disorderly conduct after using “fighting words” to officers who came to his house after he reported that his car had been vandalized was not entitled to an instruction on entrapment on the grounds that the police knew that he was in an emotional state, but were not responsive to his inquiries, and thus provoked him into a higher state of agitation. City of Bismarck v. Nassif, 449 N.W.2d 789, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        Where there was no dispute that defendant drove the pickup in the parking lot, or that the police officer observed defendant driving in the parking lot, this occurring prior to any police involvement, the trial court did not err in determining, as a matter of law, there was no entrapment. City of Mandan v. Willman, 439 N.W.2d 92, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that defendant presented was not sufficient to establish N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-11 entrapment as an affirmative defense to the charge against defendant of criminal attempt to possess methamphetamine, and, thus, that conviction had to stand. Defendant had the burden of proof of establishing that defense, by a preponderance of the evidence as required by N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-03, and did not do so because the evidence that police offered defendant a good price in order to induce defendant to buy the methamphetamine and arranged for defendant to purchase methamphetamine despite knowing that defendant was a drug addict was not enough to show that police engaged in the necessary “outrageous conduct” that would cause a person who was not ready to commit the crime to commit it.
   State v. Schmidt, 2011 ND 238, 807 N.W.2d 593, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 233</cite> (N.D. 2011).

       <p>
        Defendant failed to prove entrapment in connection with the crime of patronizing a minor for commercial sexual activity; the online advertisement and text messages from the undercover officer posing as a young girl merely afforded defendant an opportunity to commit a crime and did not shock the court’s conscience. State v. Rai, 2019 ND 71, 924 N.W.2d 410, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        On an appeal of a controlled substance conviction where there was conflicting evidence regarding the informant’s conduct, whether or not the informant initiated the sale of marijuana and whether or not the informant improperly coerced commission of the offense, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, there was substantial evidence to uphold the jury verdict of guilty. State v. Rehling, 426 N.W.2d 6, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>

        Where the evidence showed that law enforcement officers, without authorization by law, provided the cocaine that formed the basis for defendant’s prosecution, defendant had established entrapment as a matter of law.

       <p>
        Use of this section’s phrase “normally law-abiding persons” in a court instruction on the defense of entrapment in a narcotics case is proper and not confusing to the jury, and an instruction that would omit such phrase might be erroneous. State v. Folk, 278 N.W.2d 410, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>

        Although there was no dispute that an agent assisting authorities was cooperating with law enforcement officials, the jury need not have been instructed that the agent was a “law enforcement agent” as a matter of law.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The issue of entrapment is to be determined by the jury unless there is no dispute as to the facts or the inferences to be drawn from them, in which case the court determines the issue as a matter of law. State v. Pfister, 264 N.W.2d 694, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1978); State v. Hoffman, 291 N.W.2d 430, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was conflicting evidence regarding the conduct of the informant and the defendant, it could not be established as a matter of law that entrapment occurred, rather, this was properly an issue of fact for resolution by the jury. State v. Rehling, 426 N.W.2d 6, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since entrapment is a question of fact for the jury, the district court properly denied the defendant’s pre-trial motion to dismiss the charges based on entrapment. State v. Tester, 1999 ND 60, 592 N.W.2d 515, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Purchaser of marijuana from defendant was not a “law enforcement agent” within meaning of this section where evidence showed she was a high school student who met police officer while they both worked at a service station, she never thought she was working for the officer, she was not cooperating with him or with any law enforcement agency to induce defendant to commit an offense, purchase of marijuana was mere accommodation to officer, and she believed it was for officer’s private use; thus, jury instruction on entrapment was properly refused. State v. Berger, 285 N.W.2d 533, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 308</cite> (N.D. 1979).

        The fact that the sheriff’s department provided an undercover police officer with a list of suspected drug users and dealers was not, by itself, evidence of entrapment. State v. Nehring, 509 N.W.2d 42, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        That paid informant received a fee from the police for each person he induced to sell drugs, and an additional fee if charges were filed against that person, was not dispositive of the issue of entrapment, where the fees were not exorbitant nor contingent upon a conviction, so neither the amount nor the nature of the fees posed a risk of improper inducement.

        The clause “likely to cause normally law-abiding persons to commit the offense” modifies “persuasion” as well as “other means”. State v. Unterseher, 289 N.W.2d 201, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1980).

        Defendant’s predisposition to commit the crime is irrelevant in a determination of entrapment since this section adopts the objective test for entrapment. State v. Pfister, 264 N.W.2d 694, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1978).

        Defendant’s predisposition to commit the offense is irrelevant to an entrapment defense. State v. Mees, 272 N.W.2d 284, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the more subjective standard of amended subsection (2), making more relevant the accused’s criminal predisposition, there was substantial evidence that defendant was predisposed, where an audio recording of drug deal showed that defendant had decided to sell some marijuana before paid informant asked to buy. State v. Murchison, 541 N.W.2d 435, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 233</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, as amended in 1993, now places some relevance on the accused’s subjective predisposition to commit crime and is not entirely focused on the conduct of law enforcement officials. State v. Barnes, 551 N.W.2d 279, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        District court did not err in failing to give defendant’s requested jury instruction on defense of premises and property because the victim was a cotenant, and there was no evidence he unlawfully entered the apartment or was trespassing; simply because an individual may have an expectation of privacy in a place for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, does not mean the individual has the ability to exclude all others from that place or that another’s entry into that place constitutes trespassing.

       A person is guilty of criminal attempt if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of a crime, he intentionally engages in conduct which, in fact, constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime. A “substantial step” is any conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor’s intent to complete the commission of the crime. Factual or legal impossibility of committing the crime is not a defense, if the crime could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the actor believed them to be.

      <li id="t12.1c12.1-06s12.1-06-01ol12">
       A person who engages in conduct intending to aid another to commit a crime is guilty of criminal attempt if the conduct would establish his complicity under section 12.1-03-01 were the crime committed by the other person, even if the other is not guilty of committing or attempting the crime, for example, because he has a defense of justification or entrapment.

       Criminal attempt is an offense of the same class as the offense attempted, except that (a) an attempt to commit a class AA felony is a class A felony and an attempt to commit a class A felony is a class B felony; and (b) whenever it is established by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing that the conduct constituting the attempt did not come dangerously close to commission of the crime, an attempt to commit a class B felony shall be a class C felony and an attempt to commit a class C felony shall be a class A misdemeanor.

        A person can be found guilty of a criminal attempt if “acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of a crime, he intentionally engages in conduct, which, in fact, constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime”. A “substantial step” is defined in this section as “any conduct which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor’s intent to complete the commission of the crime.” State v. Wright, 470 N.W.2d 594, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1991).

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of criminal attempt to manufacture methamphetamine because (1) an agent with a narcotics task force testified that defendant possessed two prepared precursors of methamphetamine — cold pills and anhydrous ammonia; (2) those two of the six required chemical components of methamphetamine were the most difficult elements of methamphetamine to obtain, because each was regulated by state law; (3) although he still needed the over-the-counter items to complete the manufacturing process, the agent testified that defendant possessed enough of each of those two ingredients to manufacture methamphetamine; and (4) methamphetamine residue was found on a coffee filter found in defendant’s vehicle.

        Defendant’s convictions for attempted murder in violation of N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-06-01(1) and 12.1-16-01 and reckless endangerment were appropriate based on defendant’s statements to a detective after the accident in which defendant tried to kill himself and his girlfriend.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with attempted murder for his involvement in a police shoot-out, the trial court properly denied his requested instruction on reckless endangerment as an included offense. A person can be convicted of attempted murder for having taken a substantial step toward commission of the crime of murder even if there never was, in fact, a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or death to another as required for reckless endangerment; in this case, defendant was properly convicted of both offenses for firing shots at police officers.

        Where defendant was charged with attempted murder for his involvement in a police shoot-out, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury instructions on criminal facilitation.

        Where the same evidence from which a juror could infer that the defendant aided another with intent that the other commit an offense (accomplice liability) could also allow a juror to infer that she only aided another with knowledge that the other intended to commit an offense (facilitation), there was evidence which could create a reasonable doubt as to accomplice liability and support a conviction of criminal facilitation, and the trial court’s refusal to give a lesser included offense instruction constituted prejudicial error.

        Where defendant was charged with attempted murder for his involvement in a police shoot-out, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury instructions on criminal facilitation. Because it is possible to commit criminal attempt without assisting another, criminal facilitation is not a lesser included offense of attempted murder.

        Where defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury instructions on criminal facilitation. Facilitation, by definition, is not a lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit murder, because it is possible to commit the crime of conspiracy without necessarily committing the crime of facilitation.

        Under judicial precedent, a charge of conspiracy to commit murder required the State to prove an intent to cause the death of another human being, and conspiracy to commit extreme indifference murder, under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-06-04 and 12.1-16-01(1)(b), was not a cognizable offense. State v. Swanson, 2019 ND 181, 930 N.W.2d 645, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        Because the inclusion of knowingly in the jury instruction allowed the jury to convict defendant of conspiracy to commit murder without an intent to cause the death of another human being, the instruction was improper and allowed defendant to have potentially been convicted of a non-cognizable offense.

         Elements of Offense.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Crime of conspiracy requires an agreement, as explained, this section, and commission of an overt act; an overt act may be an act of only a single one of the conspirators and need not be itself a crime. State v. Lind, 322 N.W.2d 826, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 366</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant agreed to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense, i.e., the delivery of a controlled substance, and she performed an overt act in furtherance of that agreement, her conduct thus satisfies the elements of criminal conspiracy under subsection 1. State v. Coutts, 364 N.W.2d 88, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing conspiracy count in information which failed to allege an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. State v. Gwyther, 1999 ND 15, 589 N.W.2d 575, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 17</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proof of a buyer-seller relationship in itself is not enough to prove a conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance, and without more, evidence that a buyer was reselling the substance is insufficient. The “something more” required is an understanding between the buyer and seller, often implicit, relating to the subsequent distribution by the buyer. State v. Gonzalez, 2000 ND 32, 606 N.W.2d 873, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a homeowner and her husband started a fire intending to destroy or damage their home and collect insurance on the loss, conspiracy to commit arson existed even when the insurance had lapsed without their knowledge. State v. Beciraj, 2003 ND 173, 671 N.W.2d 250, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       <p>
        Charge of conspiracy to commit murder under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-06-04 and 12.1-16-01(1)(b) was not a cognizable offense because conspiracy was a specific intent crime requiring intent to agree and intent to achieve a particular result that was criminal. State v. Borner, 2013 ND 141, 836 N.W.2d 383, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Evidence was insufficient to show conspiracy to deliver controlled substances, as there was no evidence defendant and alleged co-conspirator were partners or assisted each other in delivering controlled substances. State v. Serr, 1998 ND 66, 575 N.W.2d 896, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite> (N.D. 1998).

       <p>
        The trial court abused it’s discretion in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal where the evidence was insufficient to support defendant’s conviction of conspiracy; there was no evidence that the informant was going to resell the drugs, that the informant discussed the resale of the drugs with defendant, that he agreed with defendant to distribute the drugs, or that defendant believed the drugs would be resold.

        Evidence was sufficient to support conviction for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance where, at the time the overt acts which effected an objective of the conspiracy were committed, the co-conspirator was not acting in concert with the police. State v. Burgard, 458 N.W.2d 274, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>

        There was sufficient evidence to support defendant’s conviction for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance. State v. McKinney, 518 N.W.2d 696, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        The juvenile court did not err in finding reasonable grounds under N.D.C.C. §
   27-20-34(1)(c)(4)(a) to believe that juvenile committed alleged delinquent act of conspiracy to commit armed robbery, where the juvenile was present when another left the juvenile’s residence with shotgun to commit an armed robbery, and he was present in the car when others robbed and shot victim in another car. Dawson v. Guerrero (In re J.A.G.), 552 N.W.2d 317, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to establish implicit agreement required to prove juvenile committed delinquent act of conspiracy to commit unlawful entry into or concealment within a motor vehicle, where juvenile provided access to his parent’s car to transport others to the vehicle, he knew the others had previously broken into and stolen property from the vehicle, and he voluntarily returned to the vehicle with them a second time.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that the defendant had an arrangement in which another person would act as a conduit to get methamphetamine to a third party was sufficient to sustain a conviction for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance. State v. Freed, 1999 ND 185, 599 N.W.2d 858, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 203</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported a conviction for conspiracy to commit arson where there was no evidence of an accidental cause, very few household items remained in the burned mobile home, neighbors testified that they saw the defendant carrying bags away from the home on the day of the fire, and the defendant’s husband said that the family had insurance and expected to receive money donated from the community. State v. Beciraj, 2003 ND 173, 671 N.W.2d 250, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2003).

        Where defendant and his co-conspirator were involved in illegal drugs and carried out a police shoot-out as part of a plan to avoid being arrested, the evidence was sufficient to establish overt acts in furtherance of that agreement; defendant was properly convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. During the shoot-out, his co-conspirator was killed.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction for conspiracy to commit aggravated assault under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-06-04 because defendant provided the coconspirator with the weapon the coconspirator used to beat the victim and then joined in the beating; based on either act, defendant and the coconspirator agreed to assault the victim.

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction of conspiracy to commit burglary against defendant’s son-in-law, because the jury could properly infer the discussions between defendant and his acquaintance of taking the son-in-law’s items, and their later discovery in the acquaintance’s possession, evidenced an agreement to burglarize the son-in-law’s home.

        Evidence was sufficient to support convictions for leading a criminal association to commit felonious acts and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault where there was testimony during the trial of defendant supplying drugs to individuals for sale and offering a reward for kicking a victim's teeth in. State v. Owens, 2015 ND 68, 860 N.W.2d 817, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder because the jury could have believed that defendant and another person were serious when a statement was made that they were so mad that they could kill someone, especially given their conduct during a killing. Defendant's actions during the murder and his subsequent conduct to clean up or conceal the crime satisfied the definition of an objective of the conspiracy. State v. Clark, 2015 ND 201, 868 N.W.2d 363, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was constitutionally sufficient to support the inmate's conviction for criminal conspiracy because the evidence supported the findings that the inmate and his friend participated in committing the murder and attempting to conceal it because their joint attempts to conceal the murder may have been interpreted as evidence of an implicit agreement to murder the victim without getting caught, and were relevant not only to demonstrate a potential conspiracy to conceal the crime, but a conspiracy to commit the crime itself, the evidence included events that occurred while the victim was injured but remained alive, and the inmate admitted that he participated in the events that ultimately lead to the victim's death. Howard v. Braun, 862 F.3d 706, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 12036 (8th Cir. N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of conspiring with his co-defendants to cause a financial loss greater than $ 10,000 to a company because a video played for the jury showed defendant and the codefendants discussing their plans; inside a notebook were sticky notes with names of multiple people associated with actions that were part of the coordinated event.

       </p>
       <p>
        Court did not err when it found a lack of evidence for the drug procurement to qualify as an overt act because testimony indicated that defendant already had it in her possession when the conversation between herself and the alleged co-conspirators took place - before they made any agreement. State v. Howard, 2021 ND 101, 960 N.W.2d 775, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court erred when it found no evidence establishing probable cause that defendant and the alleged co-conspirator committed an overt act to effect the conspiracy because, although the court found no nexus, a timing nexus existed between the recorded meeting and the text messages linking them to the messages.

        Where defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury instructions on criminal facilitation.

        Limited liability company’s (LLC) racketeering claim was properly dismissed because the LLC’s allegations were conclusory, it did not allege any prior convictions, and the allegations were not sufficient for probable cause.

        To establish a cognizable Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act claim, plaintiff in civil action must establish two predicate acts. Burr v. Kulas, 1997 ND 98, 564 N.W.2d 631, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Whether theft of survey instrument and computer theft under N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-06.1-08 amounted to a pattern of racketeering activity, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, was a question of fact, precluding summary judgment in civil action. Burr v. Kulas, 1997 ND 98, 564 N.W.2d 631, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Civil RICO claim against a bankruptcy debtor “as permitted under North Dakota’s RICO Act” which did not set forth the two predicate criminal acts required by the Act failed to satisfy the pleading requirements for a RICO claim.

       <p>
        In plaintiff’s action against defendants under state and federal RICO statutes arising out of a child custody dispute and claims that defendants assisted his wife in absconding out of state with their children, plaintiff met the standing elements under both state and federal RICO statutes by alleging out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a direct result of the ordeal in the form of travel, lodging, telephone calls, food, and attorneys fees, which were arguably considered injury to business or property by the weight of authority. However, plaintiff failed to establish the essential elements of a RICO claim under either federal or state law where, although he alleged predicate acts that might have qualified under the state act, there were no convictions against the defendants for the predicate acts, plaintiff failed to establish probable cause that the predicate acts occurred and, even if he did, he failed to show continuity of the acts and failed to show future criminal threat.

        Defendants’ contention they did not commit theft or use plaintiff’s material improperly would not sustain summary judgment on claim alleging violation of Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO); they had to present evidence demonstrating why complaint did not state a predicate act under RICO.

        Where a complaint did not plead dates, times, and places of fraudulent statements, characterized some events as criminal, but did not allege any relevant convictions or probable cause, the complaint did not plead criminal activity with the particularity required to support a Racketeer and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) claim.

        Limited liability company’s (LLC) racketeering claim was properly dismissed because the LLC’s allegations were conclusory, it did not allege any prior convictions, and the allegations were not sufficient for probable cause.

        Defendant intended to prevent a public servant from effecting an arrest and thereby created a substantial risk of bodily injury to the public servant or to anyone except himself where he struggled with police officers, injuring one’s thumb, and attempted to kick the officers. State v. Hondl, 506 N.W.2d 404, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of preventing arrest or discharge of other duties where defendant created a substantial risk of bodily injury to the sheriff and “substantial force” was required to overcome defendant’s resistance to effecting the arrest and the sheriff was acting lawfully when he arrested defendant. Defendant swung at the sheriff one or two times and when the sheriff told defendant he was placing him under arrest, defendant put up both fists and swung and grazed the side of the sheriff’s face, and, after wrestling defendant to the ground he was trying to kick the sheriff.

        Actual or imminent physical combat between an officer and a defendant is not required before charges under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-02 are sustainable; therefore, defendant was properly convicted of preventing arrest or discharge of other duties under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-02(1) when he physically resisted handcuffing during the issuance of a citation.
   State v. Brossart, 2007 ND 39, 729 N.W.2d 137, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence existed to support defendant’s conviction for resisting arrest under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-02(1) because (1) an arresting officer testified that he thought the arrest occurred after he removed defendant from defendant’s vehicle and held defendant at the hood of the patrol car; (2) the officer testified that while attempting to place defendant in his patrol car, he had to call for the help of another police officer because defendant would not climb into the back seat of the patrol car until both officers used physical force to place him there; and (3) the officer’s testimony allowed a reasonable factfinder to determine guilt for resisting arrest.
   State v. Skarsgard, 2008 ND 31, 745 N.W.2d 358, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly convicted of simple assault on a peace officer, fleeing or attempting to elude a peace officer, and preventing arrest because he was given a visual signal to stop when a detective activated his emergency lights and, while the emergency lights were still on and without any indication the detective had released him, defendant drove away and when the detective another officer later encountered defendant at a storage unit, defendant shoved the detective into a storage unit door, closed his car door on the detective’s arm, and kicked the other officer in the chest and chin, causing both officers pain.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for class A misdemeanor engaging in a riot was not supported by substantial evidence because defendant’s act of locking arms and resisting arrest with other protesters did not rise to the commonly understood definition of violence; it was law enforcement that was required to use force to overcome the protesters’ non-compliance, and the situation was more akin to preventing arrest or discharge of other duties. State v. Bearrunner, 2019 ND 29, 921 N.W.2d 894, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Officers were acting lawfully under N.D.C.C. §§ 29-06-02 and 12.1-08-02(2) when executing a federal arrest warrant, and defendant made no contrary showing. Therefore, the contraband yielded was admissible against defendant because it was found in a search incident to a valid arrest.

        Where defendant was stopped because his vehicle was observed weaving through traffic without signaling lane changes and because police had received a report that a vehicle matching that description had struck a viaduct, then, in the course of investigating those incidents, the officers were presented with facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that defendant was driving while under the influence of alcohol, and they were justified in briefly detaining defendant to further investigate that suspicion. By fleeing while he was still being lawfully detained by the officers, defendant prevented them from carrying out their official duties, conduct which may have constituted a violation of this section.

       Regardless of whether the officers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was hindering law enforcement in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-03, the trial court found, by then, the officers noticed that defendant had a knife in a sheath that was visible in his pocket and the officers thought defendant made some action that they interpreted as a first step toward taking out his folding knife; having seen the knife and furtive gestures, the officers certainly had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was armed and possibly dangerous.

        Evidence, including that defendant did miss her preliminary hearing, that she turned herself in 11 days thereafter, and that it was common for methamphetamine users to crash and sleep for a couple days was sufficient to convict defendant of failure to appear in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-05(1).

        Official Detention.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       For an involuntary civil commitment to constitute official detention, a court determination is necessary that civil commitment is in lieu of a criminal proceeding or that civil commitment is while criminal charges are held in abeyance; this necessarily implies that criminal proceedings be initiated and that a court make such determinations. State v. Wingerter, 334 N.W.2d 475, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 285</cite> (N.D. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not in official detention while he was in state hospital as result of an involuntary civil commitment where there was no court determination that civil commitment was in lieu of criminal proceedings or while criminal proceedings were held in abeyance. State v. Wingerter, 334 N.W.2d 475, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 285</cite> (N.D. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was guilty of felony escape where he exited sheriff’s vehicle and barricaded himself in a house after the sheriff had arrested him for violation of probation, because defendant was under official detention while in the vehicle and such detention was causally related to the defendant’s underlying conviction. State v. Rue, 2001 ND 92, 626 N.W.2d 681, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 2001).

       Failure to charge that accused escaped from prison “with intent to escape therefrom” was not a jurisdictional defect since intent to avoid lawful confinement or custody is inherent in word escape and since instructions required jury to find that accused had the intent to escape.

     <p>
      A person who willfully harbors a runaway minor with knowledge that the child is being sought by a law enforcement authority is guilty of a class A misdemeanor. This section does not apply to a person who provides temporary sanctuary, not exceeding seventy-two hours, to a runaway minor who is seeking refuge from a physically, sexually, or mentally abusive person. For the purposes of this section, a “runaway minor” is an unemancipated minor who is voluntarily absent from the minor’s home without the consent of a minor’s parent entitled to legal custody of the minor or legal guardian with the intention of evading the direction or control of the parent or guardian. This section does not apply to persons providing temporary sanctuary to minors accompanied by a parent or legal guardian in a domestic violence shelter or safe home.

        Double Jeopardy.

      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the City of Williston, North Dakota, had adopted N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-11 verbatim as its city ordinance or the State had stipulated to the substitution, double jeopardy did not attach, because the statute to which defendant had already pled guilty was criminalized flight by anything other than a motor vehicle, including on foot, under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-08-11, and N.D.C.C. § 39-10-71, governed flight by motor vehicle. Thus, a comparison of the two offenses revealed that they were two distinctly different crimes; therefore, double jeopardy could not attach and his conviction under N.D.C.C. § 39-10-71(1) was affirmed.

         Failure to Demand Hearing or Dissolution.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in dismissing criminal charges under this section against defendants accused of violating temporary injunction, who had not exercised their right to demand a hearing be held within six months of the time the temporary injunction was issued or to seek dissolution of the injunction after six months under N.D.C.C. §
   32-06-03, because the injunction remained valid and their attempt to dissolve the injunction after the alleged violation came too late. State v. Holecek, 545 N.W.2d 800, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1996).

       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the defendant was guilty of disobeying a lawful preliminary injunction where the defendant evidenced knowledge of the injunction by her initial lawful demonstration, by her response to a warning, and by her testimony, where there was ample evidence that the defendant was part of a group that demonstrated other than quietly and peacefully, and where there were evidentiary conflicts and factual questions about the defendant’s state of mind sufficient for the jury to infer a willfulness to violate the injunction.

       Knowingly and falsely answering interrogatories on an application for insurance agent’s license was perjury, since former N.D.C.C. §

       Falsification is material under sections 12.1-11-01, 12.1-11-02, and 12.1-11-03 regardless of the admissibility of the statement under rules of evidence, if it could have affected the course or outcome of the official proceeding or the disposition of the matter in which the statement is made. Whether a falsification is material in a given factual situation is a question of law. It is no defense that the declarant mistakenly believed the falsification to be immaterial.

       It is no defense to a prosecution under sections 12.1-11-01 or 12.1-11-02 that the oath or affirmation was administered or taken in an irregular manner or that the declarant was not competent to make the statement. A document purporting to be made upon oath or affirmation at a time when the actor represents it as being so verified shall be deemed to have been duly sworn or affirmed.

       It is a defense to a prosecution under sections 12.1-11-01, 12.1-11-02, or 12.1-11-03 that the actor retracted the falsification in the course of the official proceeding or matter in which it was made, if in fact he did so before it became manifest that the falsification was or would be exposed and before the falsification substantially affected the proceeding or the matter.

        Retraction Defense.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant has the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence that he is within the protection of the retraction defense provided by this section. State v. Hanson, 302 N.W.2d 399, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defense of retraction provided by this section is a bar to the commencement of trial and not an affirmative defense to be asserted at trial; whether defendant is entitled to the benefit of such defense is a question of law to be decided by the trial court, with the assistance of an evidentiary hearing if necessary. State v. Hanson, 302 N.W.2d 399, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       The exposure of perjury becomes “manifest” when the defendant knows or has reason to know that the authorities are or will be aware of the falsification; the crucial matter being defendant’s motive in retracting in determining whether retraction occurs before perjury becomes manifest. State v. Hanson, 302 N.W.2d 399, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       To have the benefit of the defense of retraction provided by this section, defendant’s retraction of the falsification must have occurred before it became manifest and before it substantially affected the proceeding. State v. Hanson, 302 N.W.2d 399, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether retraction of falsification occurred before it “substantially affected the proceeding” is to be decided on a case-by-case basis; defendant was allowed the retraction defense where at the time of retraction the record did not indicate the defendant suspected or had reason to suspect the court was on to her attempt to deceive, the court was not greatly hampered in the conduct of its business, defendant’s testimony involved only a minor part of the case, and the judge was notified of the retraction in time so that his deliberations were not tainted. State v. Hanson, 302 N.W.2d 399, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1981).

      <p>
       The word “bribe” was given a specific meaning by statute and when used in an information in connection with a charge that a bribe was offered unlawfully and feloniously with intent to influence the action of a road overseer, the information was sufficient to make it certain what offense was charged. State v. Johnson, 17 N.D. 554, 118 N.W. 230, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1908).

        The interest contemplated by the statute may have been either direct or indirect but it must have been an interest that accrued to the officer personally and not in a representative capacity such as that of receiver, trustee, or administrator. State v. Robinson, 71 N.D. 463, 2 N.W.2d 183, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1942).

        Whether a public officer, who was a stockholder and officer of a corporation with which he made a contract in his official capacity, was interested individually, directly or indirectly, in the contract was primarily a question of fact.

        Trial court’s instruction defining the word “voluntarily” as an act done or performed willingly or intentionally as distinguished, from being done under compulsion or coercion was not erroneous and it was the province of the jury to determine from the evidence whether the contract was entered into voluntarily or involuntarily.

       Statute does not prohibit testimony explaining circumstances surrounding publication of allegedly libelous writing; where accused was charged with giving $20 check to performer who was not member of musicians’ union for one dance job and, after it had cleared bank, writing “two dance jobs” on check so as to make it appear that union member had twice accepted employment for less than minimum union wage scale, it was not error to permit testimony going to proof of libelous nature of words written on canceled check.

        District court erred in summarily dismissing defendant’s application for postconviction relief because,

        Inmate’s claim that the charge of accomplice to commit murder was not a cognizable criminal offense in North Dakota lacked merit because, under the factual situation presented, the inmate could be charged with accomplice to extreme indifference murder by agreeing to willfully aid in the aggravated assault upon the victim under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.

        Where defendant retrieved his 9 mm handgun, loaded the weapon, and repeatedly fired through the bedroom door and walls at police officers located on the other side and a police officer was shot in the leg, defendant’s conduct in shooting at the police officers sufficiently constituted a substantial step toward the commission of the crime of murder to justify his conviction of attempted murder.

       <p>
        Defendant’s convictions for attempted murder in violation of N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-06-01(1) and 12.1-16-01 and reckless endangerment were appropriate based on defendant’s statements to a detective after the accident in which defendant tried to kill himself and his girlfriend. Defendant had told the detective that defendant “snapped” and that he floor-boarded the car and said that he was angling to collide with a semi tractor-trailer.

       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s attempted murder conviction was not a cognizable offense because attempt required an intent to complete the commission of the underlying crime, and murder under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life results in an unintentional death. Dominguez v. State, 2013 ND 249, 840 N.W.2d 596, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 238</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the attempted murder instruction options required the jury to find that petitioner intentionally attempted to murder a police officer, the jury could not him guilty of the incognizable offense of attempted murder.

       <p>
        Attempting to cause the death of someone significantly differs from intentionally engaging in conduct which constitutes a step towards causing the death of another human being; attempting to cause the death of someone amounts to intentional attempted murder.

        Defendant failed to establish all the requirements to support a claim of obvious error because the amendment of the information did not modify the facts upon which the State sought to prove the attempted murder charge; the timing of the amendment, immediately prior to trial, was not per se substantially prejudicial.

        Aggravated assault under subsections 1, 2, and 3 of N.D.C.C. §

   12.1-17-02, which does not require a bodily injury be suffered by the victim, can be a lesser included offense of attempted murder. State v.

        Trial court did not err in refusing to give an instruction on aggravated assault as a lesser included offense of attempted murder where the charge against the defendant did not allege that he fired a firearm or hurled a destructive device at the victim as provided for in subsection (4) of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-02, and where the State was only required to prove that defendant intentionally engaged in conduct which constituted a substantial step toward the commission of a crime and not that the victim suffered a bodily injury as required by a charge of aggravated assault.

        Where defendant was charged with attempted murder for his involvement in a police shoot-out, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury instructions on criminal facilitation. Because it is possible to commit criminal attempt without assisting another, criminal facilitation is not a lesser included offense of attempted murder.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with attempted murder for his involvement in a police shoot-out, the trial court properly denied his requested instruction on reckless endangerment as an included offense. A person can be convicted of attempted murder for having taken a substantial step toward commission of the crime of murder even if there never was a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or death to another as required for reckless endangerment; in this case, defendant was properly convicted of both offenses for firing shots at police officers.

        Where defendant and his co-conspirator were involved in illegal drugs and carried out a police shoot-out as part of a plan to avoid being arrested, the evidence was sufficient to establish overt acts in furtherance of that agreement; defendant was properly convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. During the shoot-out, his co-conspirator was killed.
   State v. Keller, 2005 ND 86, 695 N.W.2d 703, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 2005).

       <p>
        Charge of conspiracy to commit murder under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-06-04 and 12.1-16-01(1)(b) was not a cognizable offense because conspiracy was a specific intent crime requiring intent to agree and intent to achieve a particular result that was criminal. State v. Borner, 2013 ND 141, 836 N.W.2d 383, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule was applied to avoid manifest injustice and provide defendant with the same relief granted his codefendant because in the codefendant’s trial, the trial court obviously erred when it failed to require proof of an essential element of the offense and failed to recognize the information was defective; defendant was also prejudiced by the error, and to deny him the relief granted his codefendant would seriously affected the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the criminal jury trial. State v. Whitman, 2013 ND 183, 838 N.W.2d 401, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 196</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder because the jury could have believed that defendant and another person were serious when a statement was made that they were so mad that they could kill someone, especially given their conduct during a killing. Defendant's actions during the murder and his subsequent conduct to clean up or conceal the crime satisfied the definition of an objective of the conspiracy. State v. Clark, 2015 ND 201, 868 N.W.2d 363, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under judicial precedent, a charge of conspiracy to commit murder required the State to prove an intent to cause the death of another human being, and conspiracy to commit extreme indifference murder, under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-06-04 and 12.1-16-01(1)(b), was not a cognizable offense. State v. Swanson, 2019 ND 181, 930 N.W.2d 645, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the inclusion of knowingly in the jury instruction allowed the jury to convict defendant of conspiracy to commit murder without an intent to cause the death of another human being, the instruction was improper and allowed defendant to have potentially been convicted of a non-cognizable offense. State v. Swanson, 2019 ND 181, 930 N.W.2d 645, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Where defendant was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, the trial court did not err in refusing to give the jury instructions on criminal facilitation.

        This section does not require that someone hit, shoot, or throw something at someone else in order to be guilty of murder; the section requires that a person intentionally or knowingly caused the death of another human being, and one can cause the death of another without hitting, shooting, or throwing something at the victim by engaging in conduct which contributes to or results in the death of that other person.

        There was competent evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, to permit a jury to reasonably infer that a murder defendant caused the victim’s death either “intentionally or knowingly” or “under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,” where the evidence indicated that the victim’s gunshot wounds were inconsistent with defendant’s claims of self-defense.

        Circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support convictions for murder, gross sexual imposition, and burglary where the victim was sexually assaulted and murdered in her home, items of the victim’s property were found in defendant’s possession, DNA evidence and fingerprints implicated defendant, items belonging to defendant were found in the victim’s home, and defendant had injuries that were consistent with the victim’s attempt to defend herself.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for murder under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-16-01 was affirmed because he failed to object to the prosecutor’s comments on closing argument about portions of defendant’s audio-taped interview with a doctor that had not been admitted into evidence. Also defendant failed to show the prosecutor’s improper comments constituted plain error in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant because the prosecutor did not refer to anything specific on the tapes, but merely made an isolated comment that there was more on the tapes that had not been heard.

       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s murder conviction, because although there was no independent and direct evidence about the actual trigger person for the victim’s death, the combined and cumulative effect of the other independent evidence tended to connect defendant to the murder and corroborated the testimony of defendant’s wife.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction for attempted murder where defendant did not meet his burden of showing the evidence revealed no reasonable inference of guilt when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict; there was testimony that he stabbed the victim with scissors, held a steak knife over her, and cut off her air supply and this evidence allowed the jury to draw an inference reasonably tending to prove defendant took a substantial step toward murdering the victim and fairly warranting his conviction.

       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient circumstantial evidence for the jury to find defendant guilty of murder, including the DNA under the victim’s fingernails and on her shirt, the scratches on defendant’s hands, that defendant was a resident of the same apartment complex, and that he did not use his cell phone or computer during the time that the victim was allegedly killed.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain a murder conviction because witnesses testified that they saw defendant chasing the victim, one saw defendant jump on the victim, tussle with him, and then run off, the victim said he had been stabbed, and defendant had blood on his clothes and hands when he was arrested that was consistent with the victim’s DNA.

       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for attempted murder of a prosecutor, in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-16-01(1)(a), was supported by the evidence because the jury heard evidence that defendant brought a loaded gun and three clips with 38 rounds of ammunition into a courtroom, stood in a “shooter’s stance” with two hands holding the gun pointed at the prosecutor’s chest, and pulled the trigger multiple times.

       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s conviction for attempted murder of a law enforcement officer because a reasonable jury could find (1) a shot fired in an officer’s direction was intended to kill the officer, even if the officer’s head was not in a bullet’s trajectory, and (2) defendant’s intent to kill an officer, based on defendant’s social media posts.

        District court properly dismissed defendant’s motion for an acquittal because there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict him of murder and conclude he was not acting in self-defense where the evidence presented at trial included evidence that the victim’s death was the result of defendant shooting the victim in the back while the victim was walking away.

        Where defendant raises evidence of extreme emotional disturbance, state is not required to prove nonexistence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was reasonable excuse beyond a reasonable doubt in order for jury to convict defendant of murder; extreme emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable excuse is a mitigating factor that jury may consider if evidence of such a condition is raised, and not a defense to a charge of murder.

Willfully causes the death of another human being under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,” assertion of word “willfully” did not make instruction misleading and was not error.

        In a murder trial, the court did not err by refusing an instruction requested by defendant that possession of a firearm by the proprietor of a retail liquor establishment was not illegal, because the instruction concerned a “collateral matter” which would “only cause confusion of the real issues before the jury” where defendant was being tried for using the firearm, not possessing it.

        Once the trial court determined to instruct on self-defense and, despite defendant’s objection, to instruct on the lesser-included offense of manslaughter, it had an obligation, when the state failed to make the request, to also instruct on the lesser-included offense of negligent homicide, notwithstanding the lack of a request from defendant to do so.

        A jury verdict of acquittal for murder and conviction for abuse or neglect of a child under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-16-01(1)(b), (c) and 14-09-22 could be rationally reconciled and did not represent inconsistent verdicts where the trial court instructed the jury on alternative theories of murder but used “and/or” language, which could have precluded the jury from considering whether defendant caused the child’s death while committing or attempting to commit a felony offense against a child. State v. McClary, 2004 ND 98, 679 N.W.2d 455, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        Jury instructions in defendant’s prosecution for attempted murder of a law enforcement officer did not obviously err because (1) an elements instruction did not ignore the required mens rea, (2) the instructions communicated the applicable statute’s meaning, and (3) the law was accurately described. State v. Wangstad, 2018 ND 217, 917 N.W.2d 515, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 250</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the jury instructions as a whole adequately informed the jury of the applicable law and did not mislead or confuse the jury, it did not affect a substantial right, and defendant did not establish his claim that the instructions created obvious error; the jury was given the correct description of attempted murder twice in the instructions, which clearly directed the jury to consider whether defendant attempted to intentionally or knowingly cause the death of another human being.

        Where defendant argued that the trial court should not have instructed the jury on the charge for abuse or neglect of a child on the ground that the jury could not have reasonably acquitted on the greater offense of felony murder, there was no obvious error. Neglect or abuse of a child is not a lesser included offense of felony murder under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-16-01(1)(c), 14-09-22; a felony murder charge does not require the defendant to have committed the underlying felony, and the underlying felony is not an included offense of felony murder.

        Defendant was not entitled to a new trial because the verdict was not legally inconsistent where the culpability required for both murder under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-16-01(1)(b) and aggravated assault under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-02(1) was willfully, and for attempt under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-06-01(1), the culpability level of the substantial step conduct was intentionally; the culpability requirements for the two crimes were not identical because conviction of attempted murder in this case also required proof of circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life and intentionality of the substantial step conduct, but in order to convict an individual of aggravated assault, there was no need to prove an absence of circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life, nor was there a need to prove an absence of intentionality; therefore, the jury’s verdict finding defendant guilty of both crimes was not legally inconsistent.

        In a case where a jury was impaneled to determine the punishment upon a plea of guilty in a murder case it was improper to charge the jury that the court had the power to reduce the penalty if they imposed the death penalty, as it tended to give the jury to understand that the whole responsibility was not on them.

        Where the proof was such as to show that the defendant was guilty of one of the degrees of murder or of manslaughter, or not guilty, and the court instructed the jury on the degrees, it was not error to omit to instruct as to the lesser offenses included within such greater offenses.

        After instructing, in a prosecution for second degree murder, that the state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an operation was not necessary to save life, it was error to give a further instruction from which it could be inferred that defendant had to prove the operation was necessary to save life.

       If a homicide occurred while the driver of a motor vehicle was engaged in committing the misdemeanor of reckless driving it was neither excusable nor justifiable and was therefore manslaughter. Green v. Whipple, 89 N.W.2d 881, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1958).

        A boat operator’s actions in failing to have each passenger wear a personal flotation device, operating his boat in adverse water and weather conditions, operating his boat in poor light, and operating his boat while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, were sufficient to support a conviction of negligent homicide arising out of the death of two children passengers when the boat overturned.

        District court properly denied defendant’s motions for acquittal as the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of negligent homicide when a trailer completely decoupled from his pickup truck, collided with an oncoming car, and killed the driver of that car because the record contained evidence from which the jury could conclude that defendant failed to properly attach his trailer by not using a ball, improperly attaching the ball, or using an incorrectly sized ball; and by failing to use or incorrectly attaching the safety chains while towing his trailer on the highway.

        The negligence involved in a negligent homicide instruction in a self-defense case is a negligently-held belief in the necessity of using force in self-defense. State v. Gagnon, 1997 ND 153, 567 N.W.2d 807, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        In a prosecution for negligent homicide arising out of death of the victim from hypothermia, where it appeared very unlikely from the record that the victim could have been, by any means, revived after her body was discovered, someone else’s failure, if it could be so proved, to revive the victim after her body was discovered could not have excused the defendant for his negligent conduct.

        It is not necessary to show that defendant realized her conduct would in all probability produce death in order to establish that she negligently caused death; negligent conduct requires only showing of an unreasonable disregard of a substantial likelihood of existence of relevant facts or risks.

        The language of this section when read together with the definition of “negligently” in N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-02-02 is sufficiently explicit to enable a reasonable person to determine what type of conduct renders him liable under the statute. State v.

        Acquittals for murder and negligent homicide were not inconsistent with a conviction for leaving the scene of an accident causing death because the jury could have found that defendant did not negligently cause death, but negligently left the scene when he failed to get out and see what a bump was when he left the parking lot across from a bar.

       The term “culpable negligence” in former section defining manslaughter in the second degree, as applied to the operation of a motor vehicle, implied a total lack of care properly described as being in a reckless and heedless manner, with utter disregard for the lives and limbs of persons upon the highway. State v. Gulke, 76 N.D. 653, 38 N.W.2d 722 (1949), decided prior to the enactment of section 12.1-16-02; State v. Tjaden, 69 N.W.2d 272, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1955).
      </p>

       Where defendant was charged with first degree manslaughter perpetrated while committing misdemeanor of reckless driving and the evidence showed that defendant was guilty of culpable negligence, trial court properly instructed the jury on manslaughter in the second degree as an included offense.

        Where defendant appealed her conviction for violating N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-01(1)(a), the district court’s admission of prior bad act evidence under N.D.R.Ev. 404(b) was harmless error as ample evidence supported the conclusion that she willfully caused bodily injury to another human being independent of the evidence of the prior bad acts. State v. Dieterle, 2013 ND 130, 833 N.W.2d 473, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of attempted simple assault where the sheriff testified that defendant “swung, and he grazed the side of my face,” leaving a “mark on my face” and “also a mark on my knee where he had kicked me.” Defendant’s conduct evidenced he intentionally attempted to hit the sheriff and did hit and kick the sheriff, leaving visible marks on his body.
   State v. Barth, 2005 ND 134, 702 N.W.2d 1, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of simple assault-domestic violence because he caused bodily injury to a victim; although the victim testified that she did not feel any pain, it was a matter of common experience and understanding that was left to the jury. A reporting witness testified to seeing defendant strike the alleged victim repeatedly in the upper body, and defendant had a fresh laceration on his arm after the alleged assault; moreover, officers testified that it was not uncommon to investigate assaults where there was no indication of physical injury. State v. Hannah, 2016 ND 11, 873 N.W.2d 668, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly convicted of simple assault on a peace officer, fleeing or attempting to elude a peace officer, and preventing arrest because he was given a visual signal to stop when a detective activated his emergency lights and, while the emergency lights were still on and without any indication the detective had released him, defendant drove away and when the detective another officer later encountered defendant at a storage unit, defendant shoved the detective into a storage unit door, closed his car door on the detective’s arm, and kicked the other officer in the chest and chin, causing both officers pain.

        District court did not err in failing to instruct the jury to make a finding as to whether defendant knew that a state trooper was acting in his official capacity at the time of her arrest because she invited the error by kicking and striking the trooper in the face and shoulder when he tried to get her back in the patrol car after he checked her for weapons, nothing in the record indicated that defendant did not know the trooper was working in his official capacity, and while defendant argued on appeal that she was fearful during the traffic stop, she never testified at trial, the trooper testified that she was belligerent and uncooperative throughout the entire traffic stop, but did not appear fearful or scared.

      <p>
       Where jury acquitted defendant of assault and battery, but convicted him of assault, the verdict was lawful and valid since the strict standards of logical consistency need not be applied to jury verdicts in criminal cases, and since the common use of the term “assault and battery” as a single offense enjoyed general acceptance.

       Every battery was, in effect, a consummated assault, and thus a person could make an unlawful attempt to do violence to another, which constituted an assault, without committing the battery. State v. Swanson, 225 N.W.2d 283, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1974).

        Where four defendants, charged with assault and battery, admitted they traveled together, arrived at scene of assault together, were present while fighting between them and occupants of house was going on, and acted in support of each other, none of them doing anything to stop fighting, there was ample evidence that all of defendants aided and abetted in commission of the battery, and conviction was affirmed.

        Trial court’s only finding on domestic violence was the acknowledgment of the father’s conviction for aggravated assault domestic violence, and this conviction alone was sufficient reason to find the statutory presumption of supervised parenting was triggered based on serious bodily injury; while the court would have preferred more detailed findings, it was clear that the father’s conduct triggered the presumption and this finding was not clearly erroneous.

        Defendant’s conviction for aggravated assault in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-02(1) was appropriate even though the district court abused its discretion in admitting testimony from a police detective as lay witness opinion testimony under N.D.R.Ev. 701 because the error was harmless since there was overwhelming evidence of guilt. The detective testified that his testimony was based on his review of the police reports and on his interview with the victim weeks after the incident; the detective did not observe the incident or the victim’s injuries.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of aggravated assault under this section, the trial court did not err by not instructing the jury on the lesser included offenses of assault and simple assault when a self-defense instruction was given and neither party requested a lesser included offense instruction. State v. Mathre, 1999 ND 224, 603 N.W.2d 173, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with aggravated assault, it was no error to instruct the jury on assault and simple assault because the greater offense could not be committed without committing the lesser offense. State v. McAllister, 2020 ND 48, 939 N.W.2d 502, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        Defendant failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel where he was advised by his counsel to enter a plea of guilty to aggravated battery, in light of defendant’s extensive prior record and the absence of evidence tending to corroborate defendant’s version of the incident, and where defendant received less than the maximum sentence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Aggravated assault under subsections 1, 2, and 3 of this section, which require a bodily injury be suffered by victim, is not a lesser included offense of attempted murder, however, aggravated assault under subsection 4 of this section, which does not require a bodily injury be suffered by victim, can be a lesser included offense of attempted murder. State v. Sheldon, 301 N.W.2d 604, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 342</cite> (N.D. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1002, 101 S. Ct. 1711, 68 L. Ed. 2d 204, 1981 U.S. LEXIS 1398 (U.S. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to a new trial because the verdict was not legally inconsistent where the culpability required for both murder under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-16-01(1)(b) and aggravated assault under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-02(1) was willfully, and for attempt under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-06-01(1), the culpability level of the substantial step conduct was intentionally; the culpability requirements for the two crimes were not identical because conviction of attempted murder in this case also required proof of circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life and intentionality of the substantial step conduct, but in order to convict an individual of aggravated assault, there was no need to prove an absence of circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life, nor was there a need to prove an absence of intentionality; therefore, the jury’s verdict finding defendant guilty of both crimes was not legally inconsistent.
   State v. Coppage, 2008 ND 134, 751 N.W.2d 254, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 2008).

        In defendant’s trial for reckless endangerment and aggravated assault, a prosecutor’s comments about not believing defendant’s version of events was not obvious error, and any prejudice was cured by the trial court’s instructions. Also, the prosecutor’s comment during the closing, that defendant had no excuse, was not an attempt to shift the burden; the burden of proof was sufficiently explained in the trial court’s jury instructions on reasonable doubt and the defense of excuse. State v. Clark, 2004 ND 85, 678 N.W.2d 765, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite> (N.D. 2004).

       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to correct his sentence because his sentence did not contain an arithmetical, technical, or other clear error to correct; while the statutes defining class B and C aggravated assault and requiring service of eighty-five percent of a sentence for specified offenses had been amended to remove the class C felony offense from the eighty-five percent service requirement, that did not constitute an "error" in sentence. State v. Myers, 2017 ND 265, 903 N.W.2d 520, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 266</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in imposing a five-year sentence of supervised probation because aggravated assault—domestic violence was a class C felony that fell within the "any other felony offense" category, which limited defendant's supervised probation to three years for his crime. State v. Isom, 2018 ND 60, 907 N.W.2d 340, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 2018).

       <p>
        Defendant’s prior conviction for willful aggravated assault under North Dakota law did not qualify as crime of violence under United States Sentencing Guidelines because it satisfied neither force clause nor enumerated-offenses clause; it was unclear under which subsection defendant pleaded guilty, and thus, it could not be said with certainty that defendant’s conviction had as element use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force, and subsection (a) of statute of conviction was broader than generic definition of aggravated assault because it included recklessly causing serious bodily injury. United States v. Schneider, 905 F.3d 1088, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 27669 (8th Cir. N.D. 2018).

        Permanent reduction in the vision on one eye, with a resulting need to wear corrective lenses, is a “serious bodily injury” under N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-01-04(29) which supports conviction of aggravated assault under this section. Dellwo v. R.D.B. (In the Interest of R.D.B.), 1998 ND 15, 575 N.W.2d 420, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 4</cite> (N.D. 1998).

       <p>
        It was reasonable for the jury to find defendant guilty of aggravated assault because the testimony that his wife felt as though she was going to pass out, along with a doctor’s testimony that her injuries were consistent with strangulation, constituted “serious bodily injury”; the testimony stating defendant intentionally put his wife in a choke hold satisfied the requirement that the conduct be “willful.” State v. Abdiwali Mohamud, 2019 ND 101, 925 N.W.2d 396, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-02(1), was proper because the jury could have reasonably found that defendant used a vehicle as a dangerous weapon; defendant intentionally drove a vehicle forward while the victim backpedaled. Defendant continued forward after the victim fell and both the front and rear tire of defendant’s vehicle went over the victim.
   State v. Vetter, 2013 ND 4, 826 N.W.2d 334, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Evidence was sufficient to support convictions for leading a criminal association to commit felonious acts and conspiracy to commit aggravated assault where there was testimony during the trial of defendant supplying drugs to individuals for sale and offering a reward for kicking a victim's teeth in. State v. Owens, 2015 ND 68, 860 N.W.2d 817, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        Rational fact finder and a reasonable mind could have concluded the female victim suffered a permanent impairment of a bodily function. Sufficient evidence supported defendant's aggravated assault conviction, and the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. State v. Putney, 2016 ND 59, 877 N.W.2d 28, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, permitted a reasonable inference that defendant was guilty of aggravated assault because the victim testified at defendant's preliminary hearing that he grabbed her, threw her against the house, and kicked her five or six different times and an orthopedic surgeon testified the victim suffered from a fractured dislocation of her hip and observed bruising on the victim's arm that was not consistent with her story of a fall but, rather, from being roughly treated. State v. Azure, 2017 ND 195, 899 N.W.2d 294, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal was properly denied because the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction for aggravated assault as he willfully caused serious bodily injury to the victim because the victim testified that defendant strangled her; her testimony alone was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction; and the State introduced pictures of the victim showing bruising around her neck, and the emergency room doctor testified the bruising could have been caused by strangulation. State v. Polk, 2020 ND 248, 950 N.W.2d 764, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of aggravated assault because, although he asserted that there was no attempt, intent, or readiness to inflict serious bodily injury, the jury was permitted to draw its own inferences regarding defendant’s intent in using the beer bottle as a weapon and whether striking the other individual’s face with it causing a serious cut was reasonable self-defense based on defendant’s injuries sustained in the fight. State v. Hirschkorn, 2020 ND 268, 952 N.W.2d 225, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       Trial court improperly instructed jury that unloaded pistol, which defendant neither attempted to fire nor to use as bludgeon, was “dangerous weapon” under this section; since that was factual question for jury to decide.

      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for assault with a dangerous weapon, trial court did not err by refusing to instruct jury on simple assault where, despite fact that defendant had been drinking heavily the night of the occurrence, record supported court’s conclusion that defendant was coherent at time of act, that he had no difficulty understanding or being understood, and that he had no trouble walking. United States v. Thompson, 490 F.2d 1218, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10415 (8th Cir. N.D. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       In prosecution for assault with a dangerous weapon, trial court did not err by refusing to instruct the jury on simple assault where evidence was clear and undisputed that the weapon used in the assault was a loaded rifle and where defendant had fired a shot at his wife which caused an injury to the back of her head; since defendant’s action constituted use of dangerous weapon the evidence did not justify instruction on simple assault. United States v. Thompson, 490 F.2d 1218, 1974 U.S. App. LEXIS 10415 (8th Cir. N.D. 1974).

       Although the common use of the term “assault and battery” enjoyed general acceptance, it was technically incorrect, and an unlawful offer or attempt to do violence to another constituted an assault without a battery.

        On an indictment or information for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, without justifiable or excusable cause, and with intent to do bodily harm, accused could be lawfully convicted of simple assault and battery. State v. Climie, 12 N.D. 33, 94 N.W. 574, 1903 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1903).

        An assault or assault and battery with any sharp or dangerous weapon did not include an assault or assault and battery with firearms for the purpose of shooting. State v. Cruikshank, 13 N.D. 337, 100 N.W. 697, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1904).

        Maiming by destroying someone’s leg was not an included offense in shooting with intent to kill. State v. Mattison, 13 N.D. 391, 100 N.W. 1091, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an information charged the commission of assault by shooting with intent to kill, verdict finding defendant guilty of an assault without intent to kill was not erroneous, since the latter was necessarily included in the former. State v. Grassy, 50 N.D. 715, 197 N.W. 881, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 25</cite> (N.D. 1924); State v. Hoerner, 55 N.D. 761, 215 N.W. 277, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Assault and battery with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm, and without justifiable or excusable cause, was not a lesser and included offense in the crime of shooting at another with a firearm with intent to kill.

        A conviction for attempt to commit rape was not vulnerable to attack because the information also charged assault with an intent to commit a felony. State v. Murbach, 55 N.D. 846, 215 N.W. 552, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1927).

      A person is guilty of an offense if he creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or death to another. The offense is a class C felony if the circumstances manifest his extreme indifference to the value of human life. Otherwise it is a class A misdemeanor. There is risk within the meaning of this section if the potential for harm exists, whether or not a particular person’s safety is actually jeopardized.

        For purposes of reckless endangerment, the criminal code does not specifically define the term “create” used in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-03 and it is not ambiguous; therefore, it should be given its plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning. The plain meaning of “create” includes to produce or bring about by a course of action or behavior.

        During a traffic stop, a police officer made a passenger stand outside after midnight in freezing cold weather and refused to allow him to sit in the officer’s car; the passenger was later treated for frostbite. The evidence was sufficient to support the police officer’s conviction for reckless endangerment in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-03; by refusing to allow the passenger to sit in his squad car, the officer created a substantial risk of bodily injury.

        Intentionally pointing a loaded weapon at a person with the intent to shoot around the person to scare him manifests such an extreme indifference to the value of human life as to make the conduct a felony.

         Jury Instruction Adequate.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        State, to convict a person of reckless endangerment, has to prove that at least one person was endangered or jeopardized by defendant’s conduct, but the State need not identify the person or persons endangered or jeopardized; although the omission of the word “particular,” which prefaces “person’s safety” in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-03, from the pattern jury instruction’s definition of reckless endangerment rendered that part of the instruction erroneous, the instruction adequately and correctly informed the jury of the applicable law where the remainder of the instruction stating the elements of the offense made reference to “a particular person.”
   State v. Jaster, 2004 ND 223, 690 N.W.2d 213, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 368</cite> (N.D. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s reckless endangerment jury instruction was not obvious error because even though the instruction did not include the word “particular,” the instruction, read as a whole, was not misleading or confusing and fairly advised the jury of the law on the essential issues of the case, which involved a shooting at a movie theater parking lot.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with attempted murder for his involvement in a police shoot-out, the trial court properly denied his requested instruction on reckless endangerment as an included offense. A person can be convicted of attempted murder for having taken a substantial step toward commission of the crime of murder even if there never was, in fact, a substantial risk of serious bodily injury or death to another as required for reckless endangerment; in this case, defendant was properly convicted of both offenses for firing shots at police officers.

Also, the prosecutor’s comment during the closing, that defendant had no excuse, was not an attempt to shift the burden; the burden of proof was sufficiently explained in the trial court’s jury instructions on reasonable doubt and the defense of excuse.

        The court could rely upon the testimony of victim that she got a restraining order against the defendant, as proof of the element of intent to place another in fear, though the state had failed to fulfill a procedural requirement for the charge of stalking which was also filed against the defendant but dismissed due to the state’s failure to introduce a certified copy of the restraining order.

        Testimony that the defendant met with the victim, picked her up and drove her out to a remote gravel road, where he held a knife to her throat and made verbal threats to her, and that only by verbally patronizing the defendant was the victim able to talk defendant out of harming her, supported a conviction of terrorizing. State v. Kaiser, 417 N.W.2d 376, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 459</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Record contained competent evidence to permit the jury to find defendant guilty of terrorizing. State v. Hondl, 506 N.W.2d 404, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        Where the defendant entered a friend’s unlocked home at 2 a.m. while intoxicated, brandished an open pocket knife and told the friend he was going to kill him, and made threatening gestures toward the friend’s daughter, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendant’s conviction for terrorizing. State v. Delaney, 1999 ND 189, 601 N.W.2d 573, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 219</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Threat did not have to be made verbally to be a terroristic threat under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-17s12.1-17-04" target="_self">12.1-17-04</a></cite>. Although defendant’s wife was only outside in the freezing weather for a couple of minutes, for that time, she did not know if she was locked out of their home or not; thus, defendant’s action of throwing her outside did constitute a threat to commit an act dangerous to human life and the evidence supported his conviction.

       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal on his terrorizing conviction was affirmed because the trial court properly exercised its discretion in allowing the jury to deliberate and clarify its verdict without first polling the jury individually when it was clear there was not unanimity on the verdict as read, and there was sufficient evidence to sustain the terrorizing conviction where defendant’s girlfriend testified that defendant picked her up, verbally abused her and threw her against the kitchen wall, which caused her to lose consciousness.

       </p>
       <p>
        It was reasonable for the jury to find defendant guilty of terrorizing because his statement asserting that he would break his wife’s neck and kill her was a threat of violence dangerous to human life; the statement, taken in conjunction with the attack on the wife, allowed the jury to infer defendant made the statement either intentionally or with reckless disregard of the risk of causing his wife fear. State v. Abdiwali Mohamud, 2019 ND 101, 925 N.W.2d 396, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of terrorizing, including defendant’s multiple threats to kill or harm law enforcement and their families, including the officers who appeared at the trial court and the prosecuting attorneys, which could reasonable be construed as threats of a crime of violence or acts dangerous to human life. State v. Norton, 2019 ND 191, 930 N.W.2d 635, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of terrorizing because defendant fired a rifle into the victim’s house, forced entry into the house, and pointed the rifle at the victim; and the victim testified he was scared for his and his family’s lives.

        In a prosecution for terrorizing, the State was properly allowed to introduce evidence of prior assaults by the defendant on the victim where the trial court limited the evidence to one incident, and did not allow the State to delve into graphic details of the assault, and where the trial court only allowed the evidence to be used as a brief background of the relationship between the assailant and the victim.

State v. Carlson, 1997 ND 7, 559 N.W.2d 802, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Trial court did not err in denying defendant’s proposed instruction on “transitory anger” which misstated that aspect of the law that threats may constitute terrorizing regardless of whether the defendant intends to carry them out or inflict actual injury. State v. Carlson, 1997 ND 7, 559 N.W.2d 802, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1997).

       <p>
        In a terrorizing prosecution, the jury was not properly instructed because (1) “threat” was not defined, and (2) the jury was not told to consider facts from the perspective of a reasonable person in the recipient's position.

      <p>
       Defendant’s words, “when you are up here alone, we will get you”, spoke to the future and did not denote sufficient immediacy. And, taken in context, no aspect of immediacy could be inferred: defendant made the statement as he was leaving the scene, and in addition, defendant, unlike one of his antagonists, was unarmed. State v. Kurle, 390 N.W.2d 48, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 366</cite> (N.D. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for menacing was supported by the evidence because the record revealed that during an encounter with police officers, defendant threatened to “kick their ass” and “put them in the hospital,” and he took at least one step toward the officers before one officer subdued him; defendant’s statements to the officers denoted sufficient imminency.

        Trial court did not err in not excluding evidence of defendant’s conduct during a trial for stalking because defendant was not engaged in constitutionally protected activities under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-17s12.1-17-07" target="_self">12.1-17-07</a></cite>.1(5); the activities defendant engaged in were not constitutionally protected because defendant’s right to travel had been restricted by a judicial order.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant under this section, where his wife, who had obtained protective order, testified defendant called her about twenty times and made personal contact on three separate occasions when he was not accompanied by a peace officer. State v. Keller, 550 N.W.2d 411, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 168</cite> (N.D. 1996).

       <p>
        Defendant did not have standing to claim that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because a reasonable person would have known that defendant’s conduct was prohibited by statute. Defendant had notice that the victim did not want to have contact with defendant and, as a result of defendant’s conduct, the victim experienced fear, intimidation, or harassment; however, defendant continued the conduct.

      A person is guilty of an offense when, in the course of another person’s initiation into or affiliation with any organization, the person willfully engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of physical injury to that other person or a third person. As used in this section, “conduct” means any treatment or forced physical activity that is likely to adversely affect the physical health or safety of that other person or a third person, or which subjects that other person or third person to extreme mental stress, and may include extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extended isolation, whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, overexposure to the weather, and forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug, or other substance. The offense is a class A misdemeanor if the actor’s conduct causes physical injury, otherwise the offense is a class B misdemeanor.

        Where court denied defendant’s request for an amendment of the information, but included the appropriate statutory language in its instruction on the essential elements of contact by bodily fluids, any error in the failure to allege in the information language from N.D.C.C. § 12.1-17-11 that “unless the employee does an act within the scope of employment which requires or causes the contact,” was harmless because in opening statements to the jury, defense counsel said that any contact “was at the direct requirement and at the direct request of an employee, and it was the employee’s demands while performing his duties that caused any of this alleged contact.” Based on proper jury instructions that included all of the essential elements of contact by bodily fluids, a unanimous jury found defendant guilty.

       A person is guilty of murder of an unborn child, a class A felony, if the person causes the death of an unborn child under circumstances which would be class AA murder, except that the person causes the death of the unborn child under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there is reasonable excuse. The reasonableness of the excuse must be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the person’s situation under the circumstances as the person believes them to be. An extreme emotional disturbance is excusable, within the meaning of this subsection only, if it is occasioned by substantial provocation or a serious event or situation for which the offender was not culpably responsible.

       <p>
        Comparison of the statutory elements does not support a finding that a child abuse offense is similar to a kidnapping offense since the child abuse statute requires that a defendant inflict harm on the victim and cause some form of injury and also requires that the victim be a child; the kidnapping statute requires none of these elements but requires an abduction and an interference with a governmental or political function, and the child abuse statute requires neither of these. State v. Hoehn, 2019 ND 222, 932 N.W.2d 553, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        Jury was presented sufficient evidence on which it could have found defendant guilty of kidnapping, where testimony revealed defendant restrained the victim with a string from a sweatshirt, placed the victim in a car, tied him into the car, threatened him, negotiated his release, and restrained him while driving him around a city for two hours.

        Because the dangerous special offender status did not apply to defendant, he was subject only to the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit kidnapping, a class A felony with a maximum of twenty years’ imprisonment and a $ 20,000 fine. State v. Hoehn, 2019 ND 222, 932 N.W.2d 553, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court abused its discretion by misapplying or misinterpreting the law when it sentenced defendant for conspiracy to commit kidnapping as a dangerous special offender because his previous child abuse offense was not a similar offense in terms of its elements or its underlying conduct; in the child abuse offense, defendant injured his infant son, but his conduct in the conspiracy to commit kidnapping offense did not cause physical injury to the victim’s baby.

        Evidence showing defendant approached four-year-old in bus depot restroom, asked where her mommy was, grabbed her by the hand and said “Well, I’m your mommy now” and “Come on, let’s go” reveals no competent evidence of words or acts from which the jury could reasonably infer that defendant was guilty of threats of violence or acts dangerous to human life intended to induce fear. Thus, conviction for attempted felonious restraint under terrorizing circumstances could not stand. State v. Plentychief, 464 N.W.2d 373, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1990).

       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction of felonious restraint for knowingly restraining another under terrorizing circumstances under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-18-02(2) was supported by sufficient evidence where defendant grabbed his wife against her will, threw her over his shoulder, and returned to their home while she shouted to neighbors to call the police and defendant threatened that she would be sorry if the police appeared. While defendant contended that his statement was too ambiguous to constitute a threat, the court held that a threat did not have to be precise.

      Any person who intentionally removes, causes the removal of, or detains the person’s own child under the age of eighteen years outside this state with the intent to deny another person’s rights in violation of an existing custody decree is guilty of a class C felony. Detaining the child outside this state in violation of the custody decree for more than seventy-two hours is prima facie evidence that the person charged intended to violate the custody decree at the time of removal.

       <p>
        The legislature did not explicitly designate the three-year age difference requirement under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-01(3) as an affirmative defense.
   State v. Boespflug, 2011 ND 30, 793 N.W.2d 774, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 25</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a statutory rape prosecution, the culpability requirement of “willfully” did not apply to the element of the victim's age, under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-02-02(3)(a), because the crime was a strict liability crime, since lack of knowledge or mistake as to the victim's age was not a defense, under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-01(1). State v. Vandermeer, 2014 ND 46, 843 N.W.2d 686, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denying defendant a mistake of age defense to statutory rape did not violate due process because sexual intercourse involved conscious activity giving rise to circumstances placing a reasonable person on notice of potential illegality. State v. Vandermeer, 2014 ND 46, 843 N.W.2d 686, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 2014).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a case in which a jury found defendant guilty of corruption or solicitation of a minor, defendant did not dispute the actual three-year age difference between him and the minor. Therefore, the reasonableness of defendant’s belief that there was less than a three-year age difference between him and the minor was not a defense.

         Burden of Proof.

       <p>
        Former subsection 3 of this section was a statute of limitations, and the state had to prove compliance with the statute by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Ford, 377 N.W.2d 125, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 431</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        By its plain language, former subsection 3 was a statute of limitation. The state therefore had the burden to affirmatively prove that the charge was brought within the limitation period, or that the limitation period did not apply. State v. Tibor, 373 N.W.2d 877, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 390</cite> (N.D. 1985).

         Effective Assistance of Counsel.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        While former subsection 3 placed a three month limitation for the initiation of the criminal prosecution of a singular incident, it did not apply where the prosecution alleged that sexual abuse occurred only weeks before the police investigation and the defendant’s subsequent arrest; therefore, failure of the trial attorney to move for dismissal of the criminal proceedings pursuant to former subsection 3 did not deprive the defendant of effective assistance of counsel. State v. Gutsche, 405 N.W.2d 295, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 308</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>

         Specifically Interested in Victim.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase “persons specifically interested in the victim”, as used in former subsection 4 prior to the 1985 amendment of this section, means a person interested in the child’s welfare who, by virtue of his or her relationship with the child and the confidence thereby enjoyed, is more likely than others to learn of the alleged crime. Proof of such an amorphous standard depends necessarily on the facts and circumstances of each particular case. The nature of the relationship, the manner of learning of the offense, and the reasons for reporting it or not, are some of the facts to be established. A relative may qualify as may others. State v. Tibor, 373 N.W.2d 877, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 390</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        By its exclusive reliance on the insufficient legal argument that the sister of the accused, who reported the offense, could not be specifically interested in the alleged victim, the state failed to meet its burden of proving either compliance with the three-month reporting requirement or an exception to it. State v. Tibor, 373 N.W.2d 877, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 390</cite> (N.D. 1985) (decided prior to the 1985 amendment to this section).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was conflicting evidence as to when twelve-year old victim’s mother learned of the incident in which defendant father engaged in a sexual act with victim, the court’s submission of that issue to the jury was proper. State v. Ford, 377 N.W.2d 125, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 431</cite> (N.D. 1985) (decided under this section as it read prior to the 1985 amendment).

        Evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant’s penis had penetrated victim’s anus where victim testified that defendant had penetrated his rectum and a doctor, although unable to speak unequivocably as to penetration, testified that victim’s condition was consistent with that type of trauma.

        Section 12.1-20-03(2)(a) which prohibits “sexual contact” is a lesser included offense of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d) which prohibits a “sexual act”. State v. Vance, 537 N.W.2d 545, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        Where defendant was convicted of two counts of gross sexual imposition, because each conviction arose from evidence of a different sexual act, i.e., oral and vaginal sex, his convictions rested on two separate sexual acts and his double jeopardy argument was meritless. State v. Sievers, 543 N.W.2d 491, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 1996).

       <p>
        It may be inferred from details of incident that touching was done for purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire. State v. Jenkins, 326 N.W.2d 67, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 331</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute does not require an erection; it only requires sexual contact between the penis and the vulva by penetration, however slight. State v. Drader, 374 N.W.2d 601, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 405</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The tongue is part of the mouth for purposes of subsection (3) (now (4)) of this section. State v. Johnson, 379 N.W.2d 291, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1141, 106 S. Ct. 1792, 90 L. Ed. 2d 337, 1986 U.S. LEXIS 2064 (U.S. 1986).

       <p>
        Sexual contact occurs even though clothing is interposed between the sexual or other intimate part and the offender. State v. Brown, 420 N.W.2d 5, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A crime may be committed by “any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person for the purpose of arousing or satisfying sexual or aggressive desires.” Penetration is not a required element of a sexual offense as made clear in subsection (4). State v. Skaro, 474 N.W.2d 711, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s convictions of gross sexual imposition and abuse or neglect of a child because the son testified that he and defendant had sex after defendant got out of the shower, the daughter testified that defendant was present when her father had sex with her, and a third child testified that defendant had sex with the son. The jury also heard testimony from a detective, a physician who examined the daughter, and an employee of county social services.
   State v. Muhle, 2007 ND 131, 737 N.W.2d 636, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s conviction for gross sexual imposition was appropriate pursuant to N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-20.03 and 12.1-20-02(4) because there was sufficient evidence to support defendant’s conviction where the victim’s mother testified that she observed defendant rubbing the child and the child also testified that defendant touched her sexually.
   State v. Wegley, 2008 ND 4, 744 N.W.2d 284, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of class AA felony gross sexual imposition under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d), (3)(a), given that the victim testified that defendant made her “go like this” to his genitals, which testimony was sufficient to establish sexual contact, for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-02(3) (now (4)); furthermore, although defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient because it rested on the victim’s testimony, the uncorroborated testimony of a child was sufficient to sustain a conviction of a sexual offense.
   State v. Paul, 2009 ND 120, 769 N.W.2d 416, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of gross sexual imposition with a child less than six years of age under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d) because the child testified that defendant put his hands and his sexual organ in the child’s privates, he made her lick his sexual organ, and the uncorroborated testimony of the child was sufficient to sustain a conviction for gross sexual imposition; the jury saw a videotaped interview of the child by a forensic interviewer in which the child detailed several acts of sexual contact by defendant; and the jury heard a recording of the incriminating statements made by defendant at his house in which he admitted that he had engaged in oral sex with the child.
   State v. Huether, 2010 ND 233, 790 N.W.2d 901, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of continuous sexual abuse of a child in violation of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-20s12.1-20-03" target="_self">12.1-20-03</a></cite>.1 because: (1) the child victim testified that defendant forced her to place her hands on his penis over his clothing and forced her to move her hand over his penis; (2) defendant was in a relationship with the victim’s mother and periodically lived with them between May 2008 and January 2009; and (3) the victim testified the sexual contacts occurred almost daily when defendant lived with them, including the day he was arrested for the offense.
   State v. Gomez, 2011 ND 29, 793 N.W.2d 451, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-02(5) states sexual contact is any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person for the purpose of arousing or satisfying sexual or aggressive desires; the word “person” is not specifically defined in the statute; therefore, the plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning applies. The statute does not limit the definition of sexual contact to the touching of the child’s sexual or other intimate parts; rather, the plain language of the statute includes any touching of the sexual or intimate parts of the person by the child.
   State v. Gomez, 2011 ND 29, 793 N.W.2d 451, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 2011).

        Defendant charged with gross sexual imposition had no standing to challenge the section as being unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, where he did not show that the statute was impermissibly vague or overbroad as applied to him.

        Subdivision (2)(a) of this section makes it a crime to have sexual contact with a person who is under 15 years old. State v. Thill, 473 N.W.2d 451, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not considering the victim’s age when sentencing defendant on the theory that the seriousness of gross sexual imposition diminishes as the victim’s age approaches 15; this section makes no distinction in punishment when the victim is less than 15 years old. State v. Halton, 535 N.W.2d 734, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>
        Trial court’s refusal to allow any inquiry on cross-examination of victim of gross sexual imposition as to the victim’s history of treatment for a mental condition did not constitute an abuse of discretion and did not deny defendant his constitutional right to confrontation where the record did not establish the relevancy of such inquiry; psychiatric treatment of the victim two years before the incident, without more, did not establish a sufficient basis to make questions concerning that treatment relevant. State v. Buckley, 325 N.W.2d 169, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 336</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>

        Defendant, on trial for gross sexual imposition, was prohibited by N.D.R.Ev. 510 from cross-examining the complainant on her refusal to release her counseling records. State v. Lange, 497 N.W.2d 83, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 24</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, in a trial for gross sexual imposition when a prosecutor has introduced medical evidence of a youthful complainant’s physical condition, the defendant should be allowed to cross-examine the complainant about her prior sexual activity in order to show that another person might have been responsible for her condition. State v. Osier, 1999 ND 28, 590 N.W.2d 205, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>
        Where defendant charged with gross sexual imposition was permitted to introduce evidence about the thirteen year old complainant’s sexual activity with her boyfriend through her boyfriend’s testimony, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding additional cumulative evidence concerning her sexual activity through cross-examination of the complainant herself. State v. Osier, 1999 ND 28, 590 N.W.2d 205, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>
        In a statutory rape prosecution, the culpability requirement of “willfully” did not apply to the element of the victim's age, under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-02-02(3)(a), because the crime was a strict liability crime, since lack of knowledge or mistake as to the victim's age was not a defense, under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-01(1). State v. Vandermeer, 2014 ND 46, 843 N.W.2d 686, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 2014).

       <p>
        Crime of gross sexual imposition as defined in this section does not require any specific culpability; therefore, culpability required is “willfully”. State v. Cummins, 347 N.W.2d 571, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 293</cite> (N.D. 1984).

       </h5>
       <p>
        To justify a conviction of gross sexual imposition, the state must establish beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant’s sexual contact with a child less than fifteen years old. State v. Schill, 406 N.W.2d 660, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 335</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for gross sexual imposition, defendant’s knowledge of the victim’s unawareness was an essential element of the offense charged and could not be inferred; because it was missing from the information, the criminal information was defective and the charge was properly dismissed.
   State v. Frankfurth, 2005 ND 167, 704 N.W.2d 564, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 2005), limited, State v. Bertram, 2006 ND 10, 708 N.W.2d 913, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>
        Age-in-relation-to-the-victim provision in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03 is an essential element added by the legislature in 2005, but it was not an element in December 2004 when defendant committed the offense of gross sexual imposition and, thus, defendant was properly charged with gross sexual imposition based on the law in effect when the crime occurred where he engaged in a sexual act with a woman who was under 15 years old.
   State v. Flatt, 2007 ND 98, 733 N.W.2d 608, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       <p>
        North Dakota adopts the intermediate construction of the phrase “incapable of understanding the nature of his or her conduct,” the construction adopted by the majority of jurisdictions. Under that construction, mental incapacity that renders one incapable of understanding the nature of his or her conduct means that the person does not know either the physiological aspects of sex or the possible consequences of sexual activity, such as pregnancy and the contraction of sexually transmitted diseases.
   State v. Mosbrucker, 2008 ND 219, 758 N.W.2d 663, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 2008).

       <p>
        Defendant’s guilty plea to gross sexual imposition under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(c) was supported by a sufficient factual basis where the victim went to a bar where she had too much to drink and passed out in her car and where defendant came upon the victim in her car, entered the car, and forced the victim to have oral sex with him.

        Information as to where the alleged assault occurred, description of the assailant, nature of the assault, victim’s behavior after the assault, the assailant’s behavior after the assault, and to whom and when the assault was reported are reasonably pertinent to diagnosis and treatment and admissible under N.D.R.Ev. 803(4).

        The intensity of psychological trauma suffered by the victim of a sexual assault may vary, depending upon such things as the location of the attack, the kind and degree of restraint of movement or force used, or the imposition of fear through an assailant’s admonition to the victim not to tell anyone. Thus, such matters are “reasonably pertinent to diagnosis and treatment” and statements about them are admissible under N.D.R.Ev. 803(4). State v.

        The trial court’s admission of evidence that defendant had sexually assaulted a niece eight years prior to alleged acts of intercourse with his daughter constituted reversible error. State v. Osier, 1997 ND 170, 569 N.W.2d 441, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        In gross sexual imposition prosecution the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the introduction of a photograph of the victim at the age of six; the photograph was relevant to show the victim’s age and size as compared to the defendant’s age and size, whether the victim would take seriously a threat of physical harm if he reported the abuse, and to explain why the victim waited two years to report the abuse.

        A letter and postcard written by the defendant and describing prior and planned sexual assaults against his daughter, to whom they were addressed, had probative value, were not unduly prejudicial and were therefore admissible.

        District court had not erroneously denied defendant’s motion to suppress incriminating statements about the sexual abuse of his young niece and nephew because, inter alia, he was informed of his Miranda rights both verbally and in writing prior to the start of the interview, he signed a waiver of rights form at that time and, even if he was in custody during the interview, the police officers complied with the requirements of the Fifth Amendment.

        It was no error to bar defendant’s prior sexual contact with a victim because (1) consent was irrelevant to gross sexual imposition of which a victim was unaware, (2) the N.D. R.

The only testimony offered was that of a detective, who testified that the victim had admitted to social services that she had a “sexual relationship” with the juvenile.

        Testimony of victim and other witnesses was sufficient to support jury’s verdict of guilty for crime of gross sexual imposition; uncorroborated testimony of a rape victim is sufficient to establish all elements of crime.

        Circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support convictions for murder, gross sexual imposition, and burglary where the victim was sexually assaulted and murdered in her home, items of the victim’s property were found in defendant’s possession, DNA evidence and fingerprints implicated defendant, items belonging to defendant were found in the victim’s home, and defendant had injuries that were consistent with the victim’s attempt to defend herself.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of class AA felony gross sexual imposition because there was evidence in the record supporting the conclusion that the abuse occurred in August 2005, after N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03 was amended effective August 1, 2005 to increase the penalty. The child victim’s physician testified that the injuries could have occurred sometime in August 2005 and that the injuries were most likely recent in the last couple of weeks prior to her examination of the victim on September 1, 2005; the victim’s statements to the physician indicated that she had been recently abused.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s guilty verdicts on both counts of gross sexual imposition because both victims testified at trial and implicated defendant in detail and the State presented evidence regarding the law enforcement interview in which defendant admitted he had sexual contact with the victims when they were children.

       <p>
        When comparing the factual basis for defendant’s guilty plea with the elements of gross sexual imposition, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03, the factual basis addressed each essential element of the crime, including (1) the fact that defendant lived with the victim, the victim’s mother, and other children; (2) where the offenses occurred; (3) the fact that defendant had touched her on her privates, on her buttocks, and had put his sexual organ in her mouth; and (4) the fact that the victim was between four and five years old when the sexual contact occurred. Thus, the trial court did not err when it determined the factual basis was sufficient to support the guilty plea; accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.

        District court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal because, when viewed in a light most favorable to the verdict, the evidence supported the jury’s verdict finding the defendant guilty of gross sexual imposition; the victim testified that defendant touched her vagina and breasts on several occasions and he digitally penetrated her vagina during the last incident, a videotape of the victim’s forensic interview was shown to the jury, and an officer also testified that defendant admitted touching the victim and made other incriminating statements during an interview.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s convictions of gross sexual imposition and abuse or neglect of a child because the son testified that he and defendant had sex after defendant got out of the shower, the daughter testified that defendant was present when her father had sex with her, and a third child testified that defendant had sex with the son. The jury also heard testimony from a detective, a physician who examined the daughter, and an employee of county social services.

        Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction on two counts of gross sexual imposition, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d) and (2)(a), where the victim testified about defendant’s inappropriate touching, her brothers testified that defendant was often home alone with the victim and her siblings after school, and two doctors had testified that the abrasions on the victim’s genitals were consistent with sexual abuse.

        Defendant’s conviction for gross sexual imposition was appropriate pursuant to N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-20-03 and 12.1-20-02(4) because there was sufficient evidence to support defendant’s conviction where the victim’s mother testified that she observed defendant rubbing the child and the child also testified that defendant touched her sexually.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of gross sexual imposition under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(e) because the victim’s doctor testified that the 18-year-old victim had a mental age of between nine and 11 years old, that the victim was susceptible to exploitation, and that the victim was incapable of understanding the physiological aspects of sex or the possible consequences of sexual activity. Although defendant claimed to be unaware of the victim’s handicap, a detective testified that there were obvious signs of deficit in the victim when speaking with her, and defendant had lived with the victim and her family for two years.

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s conviction of class AA felony gross sexual imposition under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d), (3)(a), given that the victim testified that defendant made her “go like this” to his genitals, which testimony was sufficient to establish sexual contact, for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-02(3); furthermore, although defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient because it rested on the victim’s testimony, the uncorroborated testimony of a child was sufficient to sustain a conviction of a sexual offense.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of gross sexual imposition where the victim testified defendant touched her vagina with his fingers, mouth, and penis, and also touched her mouth with his penis; the nurse practitioner’s report stated the victim described physical symptoms consistent with genital penetration, and the victim’s description remained consistent when discussing the allegations with different persons.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of gross sexual imposition with a child less than six years of age under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d) because the child testified that defendant put his hands and his sexual organ in the child’s privates, he made her lick his sexual organ, and the uncorroborated testimony of the child was sufficient to sustain a conviction for gross sexual imposition; the jury saw a videotaped interview of the child by a forensic interviewer in which the child detailed several acts of sexual contact by defendant; and the jury heard a recording of the incriminating statements made by defendant at his house in which he admitted that he had engaged in oral sex with the child.

        District court erred in dismissing the charge of gross sexual imposition against defendant because the evidence produced by the State was sufficient to establish that a crime had been committed and that defendant was probably guilty as he admitted he engaged in a sexual act with the victim; the victim testified that the sex was not consensual, stating she was asleep on the couch and awoke with defendant having sex with her; the victim provided testimony concerning whether defendant knew or had reasonable cause to believe the victim was unaware of the sexual act; and N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(c) did not require the victim to have been actually unaware that a sexual act was being committed upon her.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of two counts of gross sexual imposition because the first child testified that defendant put his hand up her shirt and touched her nipples and that he put her hand down his pants and touched his private part; although the jury heard the second child's testimony that defendant did not touch her private parts, the jury also heard her forensic interview where she disclosed that defendant did make sexual contact with her by forcing her to sit on his lap while he was naked and that defendant made her hand touch his private part; and the forensic investigator testified that the second child had made disclosures that defendant touched her private parts.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of gross sexual imposition because the victim testified she awoke to defendant having sexual intercourse with her and she told him to stop; the victim reported the incident to law enforcement the next day; a report was admitted that showed that defendant's DNA was found on the victim's vaginal swab; and the forensic scientist who conducted the analysis of the swab testified regarding the results.

        There was sufficient evidence in the record to support defendant's gross sexual imposition conviction. There was sufficient evidence on which the jury could conclude penetration occurred, as well as sufficient evidence of violence prior to penetration to show that defendant used force to compel the victim to submit.

        District court properly declined to declare a mistrial and entered a judgment against defendant after a jury found him guilty of gross sexual imposition because there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction where the victim’s testimony provided competent evidence to support a finding that defendant engaged in a sexual act with her when she was less than 15 years old, her school friend testified that the victim was “very distraught” and was “confused” that her mother did not believe her, the court did not deviate from established precedent in striking the responses and giving curative instruction, and its failure to grant a mistrial on its own motion did not constitute a clear deviation from applicable law.

        Because sufficient evidence supported finding defendant used force to compel the victim to submit to a sexual act, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant’s motion for acquittal. Defendant’s argument that there was no evidence that the victim physically resisted any action that would need to be overcome in the bedroom where the alleged sexual assault occurred was not supported by the law.

        Where the record showed that on separate occasions when the defendant’s seven-year-old niece stayed overnight at his residence, defendant entered the room where she was sleeping, removed her panties and touched her inside the vagina, and she testified at trial that it happened more than once and at different locations, although the child’s testimony at trial was inconsistent in some respects, it was sufficient to sustain a felony conviction.

The North Dakota legislature has defined force to mean physical action in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04(11), and it is the force or physical action by defendant which must compel the victim to submit to a sex act for a crime to be committed under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(a); in the absence of force or threats of death or serious bodily injury, there is no crime under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(a).

        Remand was necessary to determine if jurisdiction was proper in a district court because N.D.C.C. § 27-20-34(1)(b) was ambiguous on whether delinquent acts of gross sexual imposition, in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d), (2)(a), constituted a stand alone offense. The juvenile court incorrectly found that N.D.C.C. § 27-20-34(1)(b) only required a showing that the act of gross sexual imposition occurred, but the legislature intended the clause requiring force or threat of imminent death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping to modify both gross sexual imposition and attempted gross sexual imposition; therefore, the case was remanded for a hearing where the juvenile court could hear evidence from both parties and make a determination of whether transfer was appropriate under N.D.C.C. 27-20-34(1)(c).Divide County Sheriff's Dep't. v.

        Purpose of N.D.C.C. § 27-20-34 is to transfer serious, violent crimes to district court. Gross sexual imposition by force or threat of imminent harm is a statutorily violent and a serious crime to be transferred to district court.

   12.1-17-02, is not a lesser included offense. State v. Sadler, 305 N.W.2d 913, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 319</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (2)(a) which prohibits “sexual contact” is a lesser included offense of subdivision (1)(d) which prohibits a “sexual act”. State v. Vance, 537 N.W.2d 545, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly did not give instruction on lesser included offense of sexual assault, since the only issue was the consent of the victim, and the evidence would not permit the jury to rationally convict the defendant of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater. State v. McDonell, 550 N.W.2d 62, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence would not permit a jury to rationally find defendant guilty of sexual assault and not guilty of gross sexual imposition, and therefore defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser included offense.

       </p>
       <p>
        Denying a request for a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of sexual assault was not error where defendant effectively admitted the occurrence of a sexual act, he had not requested a verdict form amendment to include sexual assault as an additional offense based on testimony revealing two separate incidents, and as presented, the jury must have found each of the elements of gross sexual imposition based only on the incident involving penetration. State v. Blotske, 2017 ND 190, 899 N.W.2d 661, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        Defendant in resident child molester case was not denied the right to prepare his defense by the state’s inability to be more specific as to the time of the commission of the offenses; when multiple acts of molestation are alleged by a minor child, specificity as to the time of the offense may be impossible and an alibi defense is not likely to be viable since the defendant did not claim that he was not alone with the child. State v. Vance, 537 N.W.2d 545, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the state’s decision to charge one count of gross sexual imposition for each month that “resident child molester” resided with child does not create an additional burden upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an offense occurred specific to each month, there must nonetheless be sufficient evidence to support each count for which the defendant was found guilty.

        Defendant’s acquittal on one count and conviction on five other counts of gross sexual imposition based on sexual contact with his thirteen year old daughter over an eleven month period was not a perverse compromise verdict denying the defendant a fair trial.

        Defendant’s admissions of touching nine-year-old victim inside her sweatpants and having his hand under her shirt provided evidence for a finding of probable cause that he had committed the offense of gross sexual imposition for purposes of preliminary hearing, despite his denial that he received gratification from the sexual contact. From the details of the incident, the defendant’s admission, and his acknowledgment that what he had done was wrong and stupid, the magistrate could draw the inference that the touching was for the purpose of gratifying or arousing sexual desire.

        Denial of defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal was affirmed because defendant attempted to challenge the trial proceeding, which resulted in serious bodily injury being treated as a sentence enhancement and not an element of gross sexual imposition; however, because defendant invited the treatment of serious bodily injury as a sentence enhancement he could not now claim it was error to treat it as such. Defendant actively participated in the drafting of the verdict form and specifically requested that the inquiry regarding whether there was serious bodily injury be added in the order it was presented to the jury, the form of this second inquiry did not request a “guilty” or “not guilty” response, but merely a “yes” or “no” response, and taken together defendant’s actions led the trial court to submit the case as a sentence enhancement case.

        In a gross sexual imposition with a child less than six years of age case, because defendant was living with the child’s mother at the relevant times and there was evidence that several of the sexual acts occurred when defendant was watching the child while her mother was attending school, defendant was essentially in a parental relationship with the child; thus, the trial court’s reference to a position of trust in sentencing defendant was not an impermissible consideration and the trial court did not err in relying on that factor in sentencing defendant.

        An act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a female under the age of eighteen years and not the wife of the perpetrator, was always rape; but the act could be rape in the first, second or third degree, depending solely upon the age of the defendant. State v. Running, 53 N.D. 896, 208 N.W. 231, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1926).

        In a prosecution for the statutory offense of rape without force the age of the defendant going to the degree of the crime, as distinguished, from the age going to his capacity to commit the crime at all, was an essential fact to be established by the evidence and to be considered by the jury in fixing the degree of the crime. It was a question of fact to be submitted to and determined by the jury. State v. Running, 53 N.D. 896, 208 N.W. 231, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1926).

       <p>
        Where the statute fixed the age of consent of the female, under that age she could not consent. Her willingness to participate constituted only an apparent consent and in such case the female was to be regarded as resisting no matter what the actual state of her mind at the time, since the law resisted for her.

        Evidence that defendant pushed victim down and pulled her face within three inches of his exposed penis while victim was pushing back in resistance and screaming was sufficient to sustain conviction for attempted sexual imposition. State v. Walden, 336 N.W.2d 629, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 390</cite> (N.D. 1983).

        Defendant’s motion to dismiss was properly denied because there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction for two counts of gross sexual imposition where two victims testified that inappropriate touching occurred; it was within the province of the district court to make credibility determinations since the testimony had inconsistencies.

        There was sufficient evidence for the jury to have reasonably found that defendant earnestly requested a fifteen-year-old girl to have sex with the intent of engaging in sexual intercourse with her and that his conduct violated
   N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-05 where the girl testified that, while she and defendant were riding in his car, defendant twice asked her to have sex with him, upon which she declined and told him she wanted to go back to be with her mother.

        Trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant’s withdrawal of his guilty plea, because its failure to inform him he was required to register as a sexual offender upon conviction of engaging in a sexual act with a minor caused a manifest injustice, unless he knew of the need to register when he pled. State v. Breiner, 1997 ND 71, 562 N.W.2d 565, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 73</cite> (N.D. 1997), overruled, State v. Burr, 1999 ND 143, 598 N.W.2d 147, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1999) (compare State v. Burr, 1999 ND 143, 598 N.W.2d 147, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly refused to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea on the failure-to-register charge because he offered no support for his argument that he was incorrectly informed of the penalty for pleading guilty to that charge as the permissive probationary provisions were not applicable, and his probationary sentence was appropriately categorized as mandatory. Peltier v. State, 2013 ND 246, 841 N.W.2d 236, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 243</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly amended defendant’s solicitation of minors charge from a felony to a misdemeanor because the error was one of form, rather than substance, and after the judgment was amended to reflect a misdemeanor conviction, rather than a felony, resentencing was proper in order to correct an illegal sentence. Peltier v. State, 2013 ND 246, 841 N.W.2d 236, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 243</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        In a prosecution for sexual assault as a class C felony under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-07(2), evidence was sufficient to show defendant was over the age of 22 because defendant chose not to stand on defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State’s case in chief and testified on cross examination that defendant was 34 years old.
   State v. Kinsella, 2011 ND 88, 796 N.W.2d 678, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner’s trial counsel was not ineffective by failing to enter an allegedly exculpatory lab report into evidence because petitioner was charged with knowingly having sexual contact with another person, and contact did not require the presence of semen in a vaginal swab, so the jury still could have convicted him of sexual assault even if no semen was present in the vaginal and rectal swabs of his stepdaughter, and petitioner’s other claims second guessed the trial strategy through the distorting light of hindsight. Kinsella v. State, 2013 ND 238, 840 N.W.2d 625, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 249</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        District court properly did not give instruction on lesser included offense of sexual assault at trial for gross sexual imposition, since the only issue was the consent of the victim, and the evidence would not permit the jury to rationally convict the defendant of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater. State v. McDonell, 550 N.W.2d 62, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 155</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence would not permit a jury to rationally find defendant guilty of sexual assault and not guilty of gross sexual imposition; therefore, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser included offense.
   State v. Foreid, 2009 ND 41, 763 N.W.2d 475, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 47</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denying a request for a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of sexual assault was not error where defendant effectively admitted the occurrence of a sexual act, he had not requested a verdict form amendment to include sexual assault as an additional offense based on testimony revealing two separate incidents, and as presented, the jury must have found each of the elements of gross sexual imposition based only on the incident involving penetration. State v. Blotske, 2017 ND 190, 899 N.W.2d 661, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        Transcripts of Internet chats and a telephone conversation were sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to find that defendant intended to persuade the “16-year-old girl” (actually an undercover officer) to engage in sexual activity, and when the “16-year-old girl” said she did not have a car available, defendant said he would come to North Dakota to meet her; thus, the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant intended to persuade the “16-year-old girl” to engage in sexual activity in North Dakota, where the sexual contact would have been criminal, not Minnesota, where the contact may not have been criminal, in violation of 18 U.S.C.S. § 2422.

        Where defendant conceded that the State proved the victim of the sexual assaults had a mental defect which rendered her incapable of understanding the nature of the alleged conduct and he knew or had reason to know of the defect, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction for three counts of sexual assault under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-07(1)(b).

       In former statute punishing the taking of indecent liberty with a child, the term “child” meant a human being under the age of eighteen. State v. Flath, 59 N.D. 121, 228 N.W. 847, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 239</cite> (N.D. 1929).

        Conviction Proper.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant was properly convicted of the commission of the crime of attempted indecent liberties upon the person of an individual under eighteen years of age where his conduct indicated an intent to take indecent liberties with a girl eleven years of age, consisting of a series of acts tending to effect the commission of the crime that failed only because of the flight and fright of the girl. State v. Holte, 87 N.W.2d 47, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 178</cite> (N.D. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       On the trial of one charged with the crime of indecent liberties, direct testimony of the prosecuting witness, eight years of age, who was competent to testify, substantiated by corroborative evidence, both direct and circumstantial, was sufficient to support a verdict of guilt. State v. Dietz, 115 N.W.2d 1, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1962).

        On the trial of defendant charged with the crime of taking indecent liberty with the person of a child it was reversible error to admit evidence relating to alleged criminal acts upon two other boys. State v. Flath, 61 N.D. 342, 237 N.W. 792, 1931 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 1931).

       The spouse of either of the parties committing adultery could complain against either or both parties. State v. Wesie, 17 N.D. 567, 118 N.W. 20, 1908 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 1908).

       The provisions of adultery statute were mandatory, but when the prosecution was commenced, on the complaint of the husband or wife, the general criminal procedure of the court was invoked, and the husband or wife had no further control of the prosecution.

       Even if a trial court might have erred in finding that the phrase “window or other aperture” was not an essential element of surreptitious intrusion under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-20s12.1-20-12" target="_self">12.1-20-12</a></cite>.2(1)(d), defendant was not entitled to an arrest of judgment under N.D.R.Crim.P. 34 because any error was harmless in that the jury considered the phrase, defendant was permitted to argue the failure of proof as to that matter, and no prejudice was shown to defendant.

      A minor or an individual with a developmental disability who is a material or prosecuting witness in a criminal proceeding involving an act in violation of sections 12.1-20-01 through 12.1-20-08, section 12.1-20-11, or chapter 12.1-41, may, at the discretion of the district court, have the witness’ interests represented by a guardian ad litem at all stages of the proceedings arising from the violation. The appointment may be made upon the order of the court on its own motion or at the request of a party to the action. The guardian ad litem may, but need not, be a licensed attorney and must be designated by the court after due consideration is given to the desires and needs of the minor or the individual with a developmental disability. An individual who is also a material witness or prosecuting witness in the same proceeding may not be designated guardian ad litem. The guardian ad litem must receive notice of and may attend all depositions, hearings, and trial proceedings to support the minor or the individual with a developmental disability and advocate for the protection of the minor or the individual with a developmental disability but may not separately introduce evidence or directly examine or cross-examine witnesses. The expenses of the guardian ad litem, when approved by the judge, must be paid by the supreme court. The state shall also pay the expenses of the guardian ad litem in commitment proceedings held in district court pursuant to chapter 25-03.1.

        When a homeowner and her husband started a fire intending to destroy or damage their home and collect insurance on the loss, conspiracy to commit arson existed even when the insurance had lapsed without their knowledge. State v. Beciraj, 2003 ND 173, 671 N.W.2d 250, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2003).

       </h5>
       <p>
        For a case holding that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty of arson of his house, see State v. Carson, 453 N.W.2d 485, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a case holding that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction of defendant for burglary and arson, see State v. Lambert, 539 N.W.2d 288, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported a conviction for conspiracy to commit arson where there was no evidence of an accidental cause, very few household items remained in the burned mobile home, neighbors testified that they saw the defendant carrying bags away from the home on the day of the fire, and the defendant’s husband said that the family had insurance and expected to receive money donated from the community. State v. Beciraj, 2003 ND 173, 671 N.W.2d 250, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's arson conviction where evidence was presented at trial supported a finding that defendant started the fire in the residence with the intent to destroy part of the building, and the jury could have inferred from the evidence that, by setting the fire, defendant also had the requisite intent to destroy at least part of the building.

        Arson statute (ch. 115, S.L. 1929) did not embrace more than one subject in violation of section 61 of the state constitution. State v. Isensee, 64 N.D. 1, 249 N.W. 898, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 241</cite> (N.D. 1933).

       <p>
        To constitute the act of burning contemplated by former section, it was not necessary that the building should be consumed or materially injured; it was sufficient if the fire was actually communicated to any part thereof. State v. Braathen, 77 N.D. 309, 43 N.W.2d 202, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1950).

       <p>
        Where the states established by the testimony of witnesses and by photographs introduced in evidence that there was a burning and charring of the wood of some of the interior of a dwelling house before the fire was extinguished, the trial court properly determined that this was sufficient to constitute a burning and, therefore, the completed crime of arson. State v. Braathen, 77 N.D. 309, 43 N.W.2d 202, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1950).

        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        An information accusing the defendant of the crime of arson, and charging facts constituting arson in the third degree as defined by statute, was sufficiently specific as to the crime charged and did not accuse of one crime and state facts constituting a different crime. State v. Young, 9 N.D. 165, 82 N.W. 420, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 205</cite> (N.D. 1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        An information for arson which failed to allege malice was insufficient. State v. Mutschler, 55 N.D. 120, 55 N.D. 1920, 212 N.W. 832, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1927); State v. Pedie, 58 N.D. 27, 224 N.W. 898, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an indictment for burning a garage complied with statute in its averment with respect to malice, additional descriptive words could be disregarded as surplusage. State v. Bendickson, 62 N.D. 201, 242 N.W. 693, 1932 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite> (N.D. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        An information stating that the defendant did willfully and maliciously attempt to set fire to and burn a dwelling charged an attempt to commit the crime described and defined as arson. State v. Braathen, 77 N.D. 309, 43 N.W.2d 202, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        An information was not fatally defective for giving offense an erroneous name where it charged that the defendant committed the crime of arson by burning a store and restaurant building. State v. English, 85 N.W.2d 427, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1957).

        Where, in a prosecution for criminal mischief, the chase lasted for approximately 14 miles and changed directions several times, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing use of an overhead projector illustrating the route of the chase, as it may have been helpful to the jury in determining whether the defendant willfully drove through a bean field.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of conspiring with his co-defendants to cause a financial loss greater than $ 10,000 to a company because a video played for the jury showed defendant and the codefendants discussing their plans; inside a notebook were sticky notes with names of multiple people associated with actions that were part of the coordinated event.

        Defendant was charged with criminal trespass and criminal mischief under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-22-03, 12.1-21-05, based on allegations that he drove his vehicle on his ex-wife’s property and damaged flax planted over the passable portion of the section line.

        Element of the crime of burglary requiring that entry be with intent to commit a crime therein was satisfied where defendants broke into a building with the intent to turn on a switch to activate the gasoline pumps located outside the building so that they could steal gasoline from the pumps.

        Because the specific crime intended to be committed in the premises was not an element of burglary under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-22-02(1), the jury instruction stating the State was required to prove defendant “then and there intended to commit a crime in the premises” correctly informed the jury of the applicable law, and, under N.D.C.C. § 29-22-05, the district court did not err by referring the jury to the jury instructions in its response to a jury question.

        A person is “privileged” within the meaning of a burglary statute if he may naturally be expected to be on the premises often and in the natural course of his duties or habits; further, a person who is privileged may still commit a burglary if he enters at a time when he would not reasonably be expected to be present or if he goes into a room as to which his privilege does not extend.

        Denial of suppression motion was affirmed because officers had probable cause to arrest an individual lying in the back seat of a vehicle for physical obstruction of government function, preventing arrest and burglary, where, during the investigation of a burglary the officers observed defendant and his companion in the vehicle and observed gloves, a hammer and a crowbar, and the occupants refused to open the vehicle and the officers had a locksmith open the vehicle. The officers’ use of a locksmith to open the vehicle to effectuate the arrest of the occupants was eminently reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, seizure of the evidence would have been justified under the plain view doctrine or as incident to a lawful arrest, and the officers’ use of caution in obtaining a search warrant before proceeding further and their subjective beliefs as to the existence or nonexistence of reasonable suspicion and probable cause were of no moment.

       <p>
        Circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support convictions for murder, gross sexual imposition, and burglary where the victim was sexually assaulted and murdered in her home, items of the victim’s property were found in defendant’s possession, DNA evidence and fingerprints implicated defendant, items belonging to defendant were found in the victim’s home, and defendant had injuries that were consistent with the victim’s attempt to defend herself.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of burglary under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-22-02(1) as the State was not required to show that defendant entered the residence with intent to commit the specific crime of theft, he did not have permission to enter the residence and take the television, and he entered the residence with the intent to commit a crime.

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction of conspiracy to commit burglary against defendant’s son-in-law, because the jury could properly infer the discussions between defendant and his acquaintance of taking the son-in-law’s items, and their later discovery in the acquaintance’s possession, evidenced an agreement to burglarize the son-in-law’s home.

       <p>
        Defendant was properly convicted of burglary where evidence established that defendant and three others had agreed to burglarize building and skylight was broken by accomplice in order to enter building with intent to steal and such “breaking” was overt act tending directly toward commission of the crime for which defendant was accountable as principal. State v. Anderson, 172 N.W.2d 597, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite> (N.D. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s apprehension while fleeing from building in which police found jimmied doors through which entry appeared to have been gained, broken lock on office door, and office safe loaded onto and tied to a dolly was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of burglary. State v. Ankney, 195 N.W.2d 547, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that burglar alarm sounded in building, police converged on the building within seconds, alarm sounded again as police watched, defendant ran from shadow near door which opened from inside only and was wearing dark clothing, gloves, and ski mask, and several windows had been broken was sufficient to sustain verdict of guilty under this section. State v. De Priest, 206 N.W.2d 859, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1973).

        Defendant was convicted of criminal trespass under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-22-03, based on allegations that he drove his vehicle on his ex-wife’s property and damaged flax planted over the passable portion of the section line. The district court erred in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss and motion for judgment of acquittal, because there existed a legitimate dispute as to whether the road upon which he was alleged to have trespassed became a public road by prescription under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.24.html#t24c24-07s24-07-01" target="_blank">24-07-01</a></cite>.

        First defendant and second defendants’
   claim had to be rejected that because a private individual who entered their farmstead would be guilty of criminal trespass, the deputy sheriff and game warden who did so regarding the first defendant and second defendants’
   illegal shooting of a deer on a wildlife refuge violated their reasonable expectation of privacy. Peace officers discharging their officials duties were exempt from North Dakota’s criminal trespass statute, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-22-03(5).

        Plain reading of the statute indicates the fence must be enclosed in a manner that obviously excludes intruders before an individual is guilty of trespass, fences differ in size, materials of construction, and purpose, and one fence may clearly communicate that trespassers are not allowed while another fence may not; accordingly, whether a fence is so enclosed that it obviously excludes intruders is a finding of fact, not a matter or law.

        Evidence was sufficient to sustain a criminal trespass conviction where defendant admitted that he received the divorce decree, which awarded his ex-wife the parties’

        Defendant’s conviction for conviction of class A misdemeanor criminal trespass was supported by substantial evidence because defendant and protesters were aware a fence was intended to exclude intruders and chose to disregard their obvious exclusion in an act of civil disobedience; after entering the pasture, the protesters engaged in an extraordinary intrusion by constructing tepees and building a sizeable bonfire, and they refused to leave when informed they were on private property.

        In prosecution for criminal trespass, the error of admitting hearsay evidence regarding the location of persons who had broken into automobiles was prejudicial because the appellate court could conclude that the jury verdict was not affected by the error in any way.

        Warrant for Fraud.

      <p>
       Since North Dakota’s theft of property laws are broadly defined to include a variety of conduct in which a person bilks another of his property, and incorporate conduct like false pretenses, confidence games, fraud, and the like, where the state’s petition to revoke defendant’s probation alleged that he had failed to make restitution as required by his guilty plea to a theft of property charge, and the court’s order to apprehend him indicated that he had violated the conditions of his probation for the theft of property conviction, the inclusion of the word “fraud” in a warrant did not invalidate his arrest and the subsequent extradition.

        District court erred in dismissing the felony theft of property count for lack of probable cause because, at the preliminary hearing, the State needed to establish that someone other than defendant had an interest in the property which defendant was not privileged to infringe without consent; the State did not need to have the victim testify as probable cause could be based on hearsay and other evidence that would be inadmissible at trial; a deputy testified that the victim told him that she owned the vehicles and defendant did not have permission to take them; the vehicle was property of the victim; and, even if defendant had a marital property interest in the vehicle, that interest did not prevent him from being prosecuted for theft. State v. Gratton, 2020 ND 41, 938 N.W.2d 902, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       <p>
        In a case in which defendant was convicted of possession of a stolen vehicle, but was not charged with the theft of the vehicle, the district court abused its discretion by ordering restitution for the unrecovered personal property that was in the vehicle at the time the vehicle was stolen, but was not in the vehicle seven days later when defendant was arrested for, and charged with, possession of the stolen vehicle, because there was no immediate and intimate causal connection between the criminal conduct and the loss of the personal property. State v. Harstad, 2020 ND 151, 945 N.W.2d 265, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant’s argument that his conduct was only a breach of contract and not a crime overlooked the “continuing scheme” statutory language in subdivision (2) of this section; while theft by deception is limited so that a fraudulent intent not to perform a promise cannot be inferred from the nonperformance of a contract, if the nonperformance is part of a continuing scheme to defraud, deceptive intent may be inferred.

       <p>
        Where defendant knowingly used a credit card far beyond the authorized credit limit, was more than $200,000 in debt during this period of time, his income was minimal in relation to his debts, and he filed for bankruptcy shortly thereafter, there was substantial evidence in the record for the jury to convict defendant of the crime of theft by deception. State v. Huwe, 413 N.W.2d 350, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 411</cite> (N.D. 1987), overruled, State v. Himmerick, 499 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for theft by deception, the trial court did not err in allowing the introduction in evidence of a credit card application, which the defendant claimed he did not sign, and the complete listing of credit charges which included charges made by his wife, because the credit card application showed not only that the defendant had been authorized a card, but also that there was a $1,000 credit line on the account, and the lists documenting the charges made by both the defendant and his wife were also relevant because they had a tendency of showing that the defendant must have been aware that the credit limit had been exceeded. State v. Huwe, 413 N.W.2d 350, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 411</cite> (N.D. 1987), overruled, State v. Himmerick, 499 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        In a trial for theft arising from accumulation of debt on credit card, the trial court did not commit reversible error in refusing to give requested jury instructions to the effect that a husband is not responsible for his wife’s actions.

        In prosecution for theft, failure by the trial court to include an instruction to the jury on the defense based on the UCC which went to an essential question of law constituted error that affected substantial rights of the defendant such that it was an abuse of discretion by the trial judge to deny the defendant’s motion for a new trial after the omission was brought to the attention of the court. State v. Kraft, 413 N.W.2d 303, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 412</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for theft, no crime was committed, pursuant to N.D.C.C. §
   41-01-15(5) (see now N.D.C.C. §
   41-01-17) by the defendant merchant’s subsequent sale of replaceable component parts of a building previously sold to the complaining witness, where it was in the regular usage of the trade to treat nonunique component parts as inventory to be sold as needed and replaced; therefore, the specific intent required under subsection 1 to take the property of another with intent to deprive the owner thereof was absent. Any defense or area of defense based in the delivery and acceptance sections of the UCC pertain to the element of intent which is essential for the crime of theft of property under subsection 1. State v. Kraft, 413 N.W.2d 303, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 412</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Section 41-03-03(1)(c) does not affect the authorization or deception of payments where the “drawer” in question signed blank checks with the expectation co-drawer would use the checks to pay legitimate expenses, the gravamen of the offense being the breach of fiduciary duty which occurred when co-drawer used those blank checks with other’s signature to pay himself amounts clearly in excess of authorized amounts.

Spriggs v. Craig, 36 N.D. 160, 161 N.W. 1007, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       A false pretense was a misrepresentation as to an existing fact or past event, and not a mere broken promise to do something in the future or a misrepresentation as to something to take place in the future. Spriggs v. Craig, 36 N.D. 160, 161 N.W. 1007, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 170</cite> (N.D. 1917).
      </p>
      <p>
       Information charging the obtaining of property by false pretenses could allege more than one ground, and also could allege by way of innuendo facts and circumstances, part of which could have been true, which would serve as a basis upon which the false pretenses might have operated in order to secure the property. State v. Henderson, 45 N.D. 19, 176 N.W. 126, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 240</cite> (N.D. 1919).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant pleaded guilty to obtaining money under false pretenses, the trial court had jurisdiction to impose a sentence for that offense and also for offense of using a check as a false token. State v. Ziesemer, 93 N.W.2d 803, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The crime described in former section relating to use of checks as false tokens could be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary and was therefore a felony. State v. Feist, 93 N.W.2d 646, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature did not intend by the enactment of N.D.C.C. § 6-08-16 to repeal or supersede by implication either in whole or in part the penalties applicable to violations of former section relating to the use of a check as a false token. State v. Ziesemer, 93 N.W.2d 803, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Accepting an attorney’s fee as a retainer on the promise to commence the probate of an estate by one whose certificate of admission to the bar was under suspension constituted a false pretense with intent to defraud, a ground for disbarment. In re Lyons, 193 N.W.2d 462, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to constitute the offense of obtaining money by false pretenses, four things had to be shown: (1) intent to defraud; (2) actual fraud committed; (3) false pretenses used for the purpose of perpetrating the fraud; and (4) false pretenses as the cause which induced the owner to part with his property. State v. Persons, 201 N.W.2d 895, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1972).

        Information Sufficient.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Information for buying or receiving stolen property was sufficient which charged defendant with receiving property stolen from another, knowing it to be stolen when he received it, and receiving it with intent to deprive the owner thereof. State v. Marcovitz, 63 N.D. 458, 248 N.W. 481, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where hotel operator’s clerk was accountable to the operator for room rentals and defendant hotel guest paid the clerk with a bad check, defendant thereby fraudulently obtained money belonging to the operator, since the clerk was the operator’s agent, thus sustaining the allegation of ownership in the information charging defendant with obtaining the operator’s money by false pretenses. State v. Hopkins, 64 N.D. 301, 252 N.W. 48, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 277</cite> (N.D. 1933).
      </p>
      <p>
       An information alleging the crime of larceny of livestock and charging defendant with killing and stealing a calf did not state two offenses, since it was not necessary to allege that the defendant killed the calf in order to charge grand larceny. State v. McKenzie, 67 N.D. 443, 273 N.W. 1, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 98</cite> (N.D. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the information set forth grand larceny, it was immaterial that the word “grand” was omitted. State v. McKenzie, 67 N.D. 443, 273 N.W. 1, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 98</cite> (N.D. 1937).

       <p>
        Where the trial court’s decision was based upon the legal conclusion that theft of an automobile could only be charged as a class C felony and not as a class B felony, there was no resolution of factual elements of the offense of theft, and defendant successfully avoided submission of his factual guilt or innocence to the jury; he was, therefore, not acquitted and suffered no injury cognizable under the double jeopardy clause when the state was permitted to appeal.

        There was competent evidence to allow the jury to reasonably find that defendant intended to deprive owner of the property, where defendant had agreed to certain lease conditions, including conditions stating that: the owner retained ownership of the leased property and title thereto; the defendant would keep and use the property only at his home address as listed on the lease agreement; and the defendant had no right to transfer or in any way encumber the leased property. Defendant pawned the property approximately two months after the commencement of the lease, when his investment in the property was still quite small, and the defendant knew he had 30 days to redeem the pawned property and that the property would be sold if he did not redeem it. State v. Lovejoy, 464 N.W.2d 386, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 260</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        A rational fact finder could reasonably infer that the value of stolen ski equipment by a reasonable standard would exceed five hundred dollars where the owner testified the original cost of the equipment five years ago was six hundred dollars, where a pawn shop dealer testified that it was very good equipment and its present market value may exceed five hundred dollars, and where a jury, which saw photographs of the ski equipment, could reasonably have concluded that the owner would have spent over five hundred dollars to replace the equipment. State v. Ensz, 503 N.W.2d 236, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1993).

       <p>
        Double-billing by accountant for three or four quarters, at $210 per quarter, supported conviction of theft in excess of $500, where accountant had another board member sign blank checks, then made the checks payable to himself, provided the required second signature, filed invoices and canceled checks in records stored in his office, and never showed those records to any other representative of organization, from which conduct a rational factfinder could find a continuing scheme to defraud. State v. Trosen, 547 N.W.2d 735, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant’s conviction for theft when defendant, with knowledge that he was not entitled to keep the money, issued at least fourteen money orders in various third parties, and the money orders were written on the day defendant was told that a Canadian check had not cleared and that he should return the money orders. Moreover, defendant’s writings on the Internet allowed the inference that defendant’s conduct was part of a scheme.

        Evidence was sufficient to show that the property exceeded $500 in value where stereo which defendant leased had possible values all in excess of $500 pursuant to the lease agreement. Jury was allowed to consider these values pursuant to this section despite the fact that defendant only realized $75 from pawning stereo. State v. Lovejoy, 464 N.W.2d 386, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 260</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In some instances, the original or replacement cost of the stolen property is an appropriate measure of value. State v. Ensz, 503 N.W.2d 236, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>

        Evidence was sufficient to show that the value of a washer, dryer, rototiller, ladder, plastic table and lawn chairs taken from a residence exceeded $500. State v. Ebach, 1999 ND 5, 589 N.W.2d 566, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 11</cite> (N.D. 1999).

       <p>
        District court’s order granting the State’s motion in limine precluding defendant from providing alternative values for the services of a body shop that she was charged with having stolen was in error because, inter alia, it removed that determination from the province of the jury and deprived defendant of the opportunity to have proven that a lesser amount was the correct value.
   State v. Bjerklie, 2006 ND 173, 719 N.W.2d 359, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 2006).

        Court erred in dismissing a class B felony theft charge at the preliminary hearing because an officer testified that the vehicle was worth over $62,000 when defendant purported to transfer the vehicle payment.

        In a case involving stolen tires, the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain defendant’s receiving stolen property conviction. The record supported a reasonable inference by the jury that the value of stolen tires exceeded $1,000. State v. Michel, 2020 ND 101, 942 N.W.2d 472, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        The rationale of this section is that the highest reasonable value is to be used and that the reasonableness of valuation is to be measured against any standard that is fair under the circumstances. State v. Lovejoy, 464 N.W.2d 386, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 260</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Court did not err in not suppressing evidence of drugs and drug paraphernalia found on defendant after defendant was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 12.1-23-06(1); while the facts and circumstances known to the officer who stopped the vehicle might not have been sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had committed the crime of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and to support a conviction, they were sufficient, when viewed in totality, to furnish a prudent person with reasonable grounds for believing a violation had occurred.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of misapplication of entrusted property under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-23-07, because a factfinder could reasonably infer defendant knew the withdrawal and expenditure of the grandmother’s funds was unauthorized when she withdrew and spent the funds, since one could infer she knew these acts were not undertaken to benefit the grandmother pursuant to the durable power of attorney; defendant admitted she gambled with some of the money she withdrew from her grandmother’s account, defendant purchased a vehicle with her grandmother’s money and that she, and not her grandmother, enjoyed the benefits of using the vehicle, the officer testified defendant admitted to using a considerable amount of the grandmother’s money on various types of illegal drugs, and defendant testified she used the grandmother’s funds to pay her own personal debts.

        Under the statute “embezzlement” arose out of a fraudulent appropriation or conversion of property by a person to whom the property had been entrusted, and who had lawfully acquired possession thereof. State v. Schmidt, 72 N.D. 719, 10 N.W.2d 868, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1943).

       <p>
        An information under former section was indefinite and uncertain where it charged embezzlement by fraudulent appropriation, or embezzlement by secreting the property with intent to fraudulently appropriate it thereafter. State v. Lonne, 15 N.D. 275, 107 N.W. 524, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 1906).
       </p>

        An information was defective where it attempted to combine a portion of section defining embezzlement by corporate officer or government agent with portion of section defining embezzlement by a bailee. State v. Ruemmele, 64 N.D. 248, 251 N.W. 879, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 271</cite> (N.D. 1933).

        An information charging state treasurer with embezzling public moneys, bank drafts, notes, bills of exchange, and valuable securities of the aggregate value of $60,438.11 was sufficient without specification of items. State v. Bickford, 28 N.D. 36, 147 N.W. 407 (N.D. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        An information charging fraudulent conversion by bailee need not have alleged a demand for the return of the property alleged to have been embezzled. State v. Hoff, 29 N.D. 412, 150 N.W. 929, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 18</cite> (N.D. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information charging officer of bank with embezzling “property of said bank” was sufficient where it stated that the property was $13,400. State v. Hastings, 54 N.D. 871, 211 N.W. 813, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 98</cite> (N.D. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment or information for embezzlement did not need to describe the property with particularity but could describe it in general terms. State v. O'Connor, 58 N.D. 554, 226 N.W. 601, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 250</cite> (N.D. 1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        An information against a county auditor was sufficient where it alleged that “he did aid and advise” in the commission of the acts which the treasurer was charged with having committed.

       <p>
        An information charging the defendant, while acting county auditor, with unlawfully participating in the embezzlement of county funds, if the offense was fully described, was sufficient without referring to the section or subsection of the statute creating the offense charged.

        More Than One Selling.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was enacted to facilitate prosecution of fences, i.e., those who deal in stolen property as a routine business, both within and without the state. In view of the legislative history of this section, it is not likely that the drafters intended the offense of dealing in stolen property to encompass just one instance of selling stolen property. State v. Haugen, 365 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section requires more than one instance of selling stolen property to constitute the offense of dealing in stolen property. State v. Haugen, 365 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Negotiations conducted once in the morning and again in the afternoon did not constitute two instances of selling stolen property, where the afternoon meeting was a continuation of the negotiations conducted earlier that day. Therefore, conduct did not constitute “dealing in stolen property.” State v. Haugen, 365 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In reconciling N.D.C.C. § 12.1-23-02(3) and subsection (1) of this section, it is likely that subsection (1) was designed to prosecute a person who sells stolen property on more than one occasion rather than in one isolated instance. The disposing of stolen property on one occasion is already prohibited by N.D.C.C. § 12.1-23-02(3), provided the state proves the necessary culpability requirements. State v. Haugen, 365 N.W.2d 549, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       District court erred in dismissing the felony theft of property count for lack of probable cause because, at the preliminary hearing, the State needed to establish that someone other than defendant had an interest in the property which defendant was not privileged to infringe without consent; the State did not need to have the victim testify as probable cause could be based on hearsay and other evidence that would be inadmissible at trial; a deputy testified that the victim told him that she owned the vehicles and defendant did not have permission to take them; the vehicle was property of the victim; and, even if defendant had a marital property interest in the vehicle, that interest did not prevent him from being prosecuted for theft.

       Where defendant charged with attempted theft by deception based on his backdating a life insurance premium payment check to a date prior to his son’s death failed to introduce any evidence suggesting he had an honest belief he was entitled to claim the insurance proceeds, the trial court’s failure to instruct the jury on a claim of right defense did not constitute obvious error.

        In a trial for theft arising from accumulation of debt on credit card, the trial court did not commit reversible error in refusing to give requested jury instructions to the effect that a husband is not responsible for his wife’s actions. State v. Huwe, 413 N.W.2d 350, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 411</cite> (N.D. 1987), overruled, State v. Himmerick, 499 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for theft by deception, the trial court did not err in allowing the introduction in evidence of a credit card application, which the defendant claimed he did not sign, and the complete listing of credit charges which included charges made by his wife, because the credit card application showed not only that the defendant had been authorized a card, but also that there was a $1,000 credit limit on the account, and the lists documenting the charges made by both the defendant and his wife were also relevant because they had a tendency of showing that the defendant must have been aware that the credit limit had been exceeded. State v. Huwe, 413 N.W.2d 350, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 411</cite> (N.D. 1987), overruled, State v. Himmerick, 499 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       <p>
        Where the defendant knowingly used a credit card far beyond the authorized credit limit, was more than $200,000 in debt during this period of time, his income was minimal in relation to his debts, and he filed for bankruptcy shortly thereafter, there was substantial evidence in the record for the jury to convict defendant of the crime of theft by deception. State v. Huwe, 413 N.W.2d 350, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 411</cite> (N.D. 1987), overruled, State v. Himmerick, 499 N.W.2d 568, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        The defendant did intend to create or reinforce a false impression with his forgery of the buyer’s signature on a bill of sale; the buyer had returned cattle that did not give birth with the understanding that they would be exchanged, and the bill of sale was intended to discourage the buyer from pursuing legal action when the defendant instead sent the buyer a monetary sum for each head of returned cattle. State v. Bollingberg, 2004 ND 30, 674 N.W.2d 281, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        In prosecution for theft by deception, the defendant’s filing for bankruptcy within six months after credit charges were made had some probative value as to whether he had the intention or ability to pay off the debt at the time the charges were made, even though there was no evidence that he was contemplating bankruptcy at the time the credit charges were made.

        The broad definitions of conspiracy, theft of property, and deception evidence a legislative intent that conspiracy to commit theft by deception encompass an agreement to knowingly manufacture evidence to support a false claim in a civil action.

        An agreement to knowingly manufacture evidence for a civil lawsuit seeking compensation for a claimed loss, knowing that no actual loss occurred, constitutes conspiracy to commit theft by deception.

        Fact that one person has title to property does not preclude property from being property of another person within meaning of this section; fact that title to automobile remained in name of defendant at time of its theft did not preclude a finding that defendant took or exercised unauthorized control over property of another where there was evidence that defendant had traded car to another person prior to its theft. State v. Cox, 325 N.W.2d 181, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 339</cite> (N.D. 1982).

        District court erred in dismissing the felony theft of property count for lack of probable cause because, at the preliminary hearing, the State needed to establish that someone other than defendant had an interest in the property which defendant was not privileged to infringe without consent; the State did not need to have the victim testify as probable cause could be based on hearsay and other evidence that would be inadmissible at trial; a deputy testified that the victim told him that she owned the vehicles and defendant did not have permission to take them; the vehicle was property of the victim; and, even if defendant had a marital property interest in the vehicle, that interest did not prevent him from being prosecuted for theft. State v. Gratton, 2020 ND 41, 938 N.W.2d 902, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 37</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        Defendant’s argument that his conduct was only a breach of contract and not a crime overlooked the “continuing scheme” statutory language in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-23-02; while theft by deception is limited so that a fraudulent intent not to perform a promise cannot be inferred from the nonperformance of a contract, if the nonperformance is part of a continuing scheme to defraud, deceptive intent may be inferred. State v. Hersch, 445 N.W.2d 626, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1989).

        Double-billing by accountant for three or four quarters, at $210 per quarter, supported conviction of theft in excess of $500, where accountant had another board member sign blank checks, then made the checks payable to himself, provided the required second signature, filed invoices and canceled checks in records stored in his office, and never showed those records to any other representative of organization, from which conduct a rational factfinder could find a continuing scheme to defraud. State v. Trosen, 547 N.W.2d 735, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1996).

        Evidence from surrounding facts and circumstances was sufficient for the jury to draw an inference that the defendant knowingly forged a check or presented a forged check where defendant had access to checks, the store clerk identified defendant as the person who filled out a portion of the check, the check was in an unlikely amount for babysitting services, and defendant’s testimony regarding how he received the check was unlikely.

        The offense defined as the making of false entries by corporate officers involved four elements: the relationship of employee, the falsification of the account or record, the specific intent with which the act was done, and, if the specific intent was concealment, the commission of embezzlement, defalcation, or misconduct which the falsification was intended to conceal. State v. Craig, 54 N.D. 5, 208 N.W. 394, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1926).

        Prosecutions for the offense of uttering forged instruments or coins were limited to the utterance of instruments which were the subject of forgery. State v. Ryan, 9 N.D. 419, 83 N.W. 865, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 248</cite> (N.D. 1900).

        The making of a false entry in the minutes of the board of directors by the president of a bank with intent to conceal his prior misconduct was an offense under former section proscribing false entries by corporate officers.

        In a prosecution for uttering a forged instrument, knowing it to be forged, it was an essential ingredient that the uttering was done with intent to defraud. State v. Campbell, 67 N.D. 581, 274 N.W. 844, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 1937).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Former statute proscribing false entries by corporate officers was designed to penalize officers, members, or employees of corporations, associations, or partnerships, who falsified accounts or records of the corporation or association with intent to defraud the employer or to conceal defalcation or misconduct. State v. Craig, 54 N.D. 5, 208 N.W. 394, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the purpose of the former section, regarding issuing false evidence of debt, to penalize the making and issuance of an instrument falsely purporting to be an evidence of debt of a corporation without the authority of the managing officers of such corporation. State v. Bell, 67 N.D. 382, 272 N.W. 334, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 1937).

        Defendant’s conviction for class A misdemeanor engaging in a riot was not supported by substantial evidence because defendant’s act of locking arms and resisting arrest with other protesters did not rise to the commonly understood definition of violence; it was law enforcement that was required to use force to overcome the protesters’ non-compliance, and the situation was more akin to preventing arrest or discharge of other duties.

        In a prosecution of defendant for engaging in a riot while armed, the trial court did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal at trial or in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence. A witness testified she was 100 percent sure that defendant had participated in a fight and was armed with a baseball bat, and the jury judged the credibility of the witnesses and weighed the evidence admitted at trial, and this evidence was not reweighed on appeal.

        Former section on buying, selling, etc., obscene materials was unconstitutional as it failed to require scienter and was overly broad and so ambiguous that it failed to provide adequate, fair notice of criminal conduct regulated; words such as “salacious”, “lascivious”, “obscene”, “lewd”, and “indecent” were so void of common meaning when applied to a particular act that a person would have no way of determining whether his conduct or material violated the statute.

       <p>
        Requirement that acts prosecuted under indecent exposure law had to “openly outrage public decency” was a part of the statutory definition, and the act must have been done openly, and not to the exclusion of public observation, to constitute the crime. State v. Stevens, 33 N.D. 540, 157 N.W. 668, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1916).

        Defendant’s motion to dismiss the charge of attempted promotion of obscenity to minors, N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-27.1-03(1) and 12.1-06-01, should have been granted because the reckless culpability required for the offense of promoting obscenity to minors was inconsistent with and could not be rectified with the culpability required for criminal attempt. Even if the State could impose a higher burden than the statute required in an attempt to create a cognizable offense, the State had not done so where it did not allege in the information that defendant intentionally promoted the obscenity.

        District court did not err by summarily denying defendant's application for postconviction relief where the Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated by defendant's conviction of 119 counts of possession of child pornography, as the plain language of this section authorized multiple prosecutions and punishments based on the number of prohibited images possessed rather than on the number of computers possessed containing those images.

        While the trial court erred in deciding whether defendant was statutorily required to register as a sex offender after defendant’s probation was revoked, it nevertheless correctly determined that defendant had to register as a sex offender, and, thus, that decision had to be upheld on appeal. The trial court found that it should apply N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(2)(b), a permissive registration statute that took into account a number of factors to decide whether such registration was required, although it should have applied N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(2)(a) making it mandatory for felony sex offenders to register, as defendant had pled guilty to the sex offense of possession of certain materials prohibited under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-27.2s12.1-27.2-04" target="_self">12.1-27.2-04</a></cite>.1, which was a Class C felony.

       Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s request to deviate from a plea agreement because the trial court considered defendant’s criminal history, the commission of new offenses, and defendant’s apparent inability to follow the law. The sentence was appropriate because the trial court followed the parties’ agreement, and the trial court did not enhance defendant’s sentence.

        In a prosecution for gambling, where the defendant’s statement indicated that, while he was working in Mercer County, he placed and accepted bets and passed the proceeds on to a man known as “Chief”, and a witness who personally engaged in gambling transactions with the defendant testified that he obtained line sheets from the defendant which he then used to solicit wagers from coworkers in Oliver County, and he later turned the bets over to the defendant, who paid him for his services, the defendant’s written statement that he met “Chief” while working in Mercer County and that he placed wagers for others which he then turned over to “Chief” certainly supported a reasonable inference that part of the gambling transactions took place in Mercer County; therefore, venue in Mercer County was proper.

        City disorderly conduct ordinance which did not attempt to prohibit or penalize any speech other than that which is constitutionally prohibited by N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-31-01, and which contained additional language that only clarified the particular language which it prohibited, literally expressing what the state statute must be construed to include to be constitutional, did not supersede the state statute. As the ordinance stood in its entirety, it was not facially susceptible of application to constitutionally protected speech and therefore was not unconstitutional. City of Bismarck v.

        Section 12.1-05-03, N.D.C.C., which describes self-defense as justification, applies to conduct, and is not limited to specified offenses; thus if a person is justified in engaging in conduct that would otherwise constitute disorderly conduct, self defense is a defense.

        Where defendant was in the only tanning booth with access to another booth at the time another patron saw a mirror, mirror fragments were found in defendant’s garbage, and the state submitted evidence showing a mirror could be manipulated from defendant’s booth into the other booth so as to display its contents, the evidence was sufficient for a rational factfinder to find beyond a reasonable doubt defendant’s actions violated former subsection (7), now see subdivision (1)(g) for similar provisions. State v. Carriere, 545 N.W.2d 773, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1996).

       <p>
        State of North Dakota produced sufficient evidence to sustain defendant’s disorderly conduct conviction under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-01(1) by showing that a reasonable person in neighbor’s shoes would have become alarmed by defendant’s actions of yelling loudly and shouting profanity in light of defendant’s past reckless endangerment conviction for shooting the neighbor’s husband with a pellet gun.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of disorderly conduct where defendant was involved in a dispute over the right to cut hay, the sheriff asked him to remove his machinery, he refused and became angry, began yelling obscenities and making obscene and threatening gestures toward the sheriff, he made gestures close to the sheriff’s face, and, after swinging at the sheriff’s face, he was wrestled to the ground.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s motion to dismiss a charge of disorderly conduct under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-01 was properly denied because, while defendant could not have been charged for disorderly conduct solely on the basis of the content of his speech, the affidavit filed with the complaint described conduct that could be the basis of disorderly conduct charges, such as defendant’s intentional yelling on a city street in the middle of the night in a residential area or his pointing at a sheriff’s deputy while standing five feet away and yelling obscenities.

        Where a juvenile was charged with delinquency based upon disorderly conduct after she and two other girls followed an African-American girl into a bathroom at a teen center and began yelling at her, using racial slurs, and threatening her, the juvenile court did not err in finding that the juvenile committed acts constituting disorderly conduct because her use of racial slurs heightened the potential that her threatening statements and actions would incite a breach of the peace or violent reaction and because her threatening behavior and harassing conduct was intended to adversely affect the safety, security, or privacy of the victim.
   Cruff v. H.K. (In re H.K.), 2010 ND 27, 778 N.W.2d 764, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence was introduced to support a finding that the juvenile was a delinquent and unruly child, and, thus, the juvenile’s adjudication in that regard had to be upheld. The State had presented evidence at the relevant hearing about one such act that occurred in a classroom when the juvenile started screaming words that were not making sense, started throwing objects, and then kicked an aide, as well as a second such act on a school bus when the juvenile started screaming and using vulgar language, and, thus, the evidence showed that the juvenile engaged in multiple acts of disorderly conduct in violation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-01(1).

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for disorderly conduct. Although defendant claimed that he lacked the requisite intent for the crime, that he had a legitimate purpose in protesting at a construction site, and that no testimony established defendant intended to adversely affect the safety, security, and privacy of another person, these arguments merely requested the Supreme Court to reweigh the evidence. State v. Decker, 2018 ND 43, 907 N.W.2d 378, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 56</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        Sufficient evidence supported defendants’ disorderly conduct convictions under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-01 where photographs and testimony showed that they were part of a group engaged in attempts to flank law enforcement’s skirmish lines on private property after being told to return to a state highway in an effort to advance toward construction equipment.

        Where a juvenile was charged with delinquency based upon disorderly conduct after she and two other girls followed an African-American girl into a bathroom at a teen center and began yelling at her, using racial slurs, and threatening her, the juvenile court did not err in denying the juvenile’s motion to dismiss because the First Amendment did not prohibit the juvenile court from considering the juvenile’s statements, as well as the context in which she made the statements, in determining whether the delinquency petition sufficiently set forth a charge of disorderly conduct. While the disorderly conduct statute did not apply to constitutionally protected activity and protected the mere use of racial slurs, the juvenile did more than simply utter an offensive racial epithet; her use of racial slurs heightened the potential that her threatening statements and actions would incite a breach of the peace or violent reaction.
   Cruff v. H.K. (In re H.K.), 2010 ND 27, 778 N.W.2d 764, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 30</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants’ conduct underlying the conviction was not constitutionally protected activity under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-01(2) as the multiple attempts to flank law enforcement and move toward construction equipment on private property after being directed to leave was not protected speech merely because it occurred at a protest or was accompanied by carried signs or speaking for a cause. State v. Simon, 2018 ND 197, 916 N.W.2d 626, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        Court did not err in refusing to instruct jury that disorderly conduct was a lesser included offense of terrorizing, where, if jury had believed defendant’s assertion he lacked the requisite intent for his statements to constitute terrorizing, the jury could also not convict him on the charge of disorderly conduct. State v. Carlson, 1997 ND 7, 559 N.W.2d 802, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Employee’s restraining order was affirmed because the customer’s actions of hitting the employee satisfied the definition of disorderly conduct, when hitting the employee constituted an intrusive and unwanted act intended to adversely affect the safety and security of the employee, and a disorderly conduct restraining order did not require a pattern of behavior.
   Wetzel v. Schlenvogt, 2005 ND 190, 705 N.W.2d 836, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 230</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether to issue a disorderly conduct restraining order under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31-01(1)(h), appellant’s conduct had to be viewed in its totality, and therefore, even constitutionally protected speech was of no consequence if appellant engaged in harassing conduct meant to adversely affect the privacy of another person.

        The offense of grossly disturbing the public peace as defined in this section was a graver offense than ordinary breach of the peace. Proof of such offense, to be sufficient, had to establish that the public peace was actually and grossly disturbed. State v. Laufenberg, 99 N.W.2d 331, 1959 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Where there was no evidence in the record that the tranquility and sense of security enjoyed by the public were in any manner disturbed, a conviction of the offense of grossly disturbing the public peace could not be sustained.

        Statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad or unconstitutional as applied to defendant because she had been served with temporary disorderly conduct orders, the district court had jurisdiction to enter the orders, and they were not void on their face; although counsel attempted to argue the temporary restraining orders dispossessed or deprived defendant of her real property, she was not charged or convicted for being in her home but for her conduct in approaching and speaking to neighbors.

        Petitioner’s contact with a respondent who is subject to the restrictions imposed by a temporary restraining order might certainly be a factor for the court to consider in evaluating the merits of the petition during the hearing, but it does not automatically bar the petitioner from any relief.

        District court errs as a matter of law when it denies a respondent the full and fair hearing mandated by N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31.2-01 and due process. The same rule applies to a review of a magistrate’s decision under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.27.html#t27c27-05s27-05-31" target="_blank">27-05-31</a></cite>.

       <p>
        Husband was denied due process because he was not afforded a full hearing before a magistrate entered a disorderly conduct restraining order under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31.2-01(5)(d); no evidence was offered by the wife during the proceeding to support the allegations in her petition, and the husband was not given an opportunity to rebut any of the allegations. The magistrate’s focus on dispensing with the evidentiary hearing in his case could have been viewed as subtle coercion; therefore, the husband did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his right to the hearing.
   Harris v. Harris, 2010 ND 45, 779 N.W.2d 642, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 44</cite> (N.D. 2010).

       <p>
        In the context of a request for a restraining order, a district court abused its discretion in not allowing defendant to directly cross-examine the complainant without adequately explaining, on the record, its reasons for not allowing him to do so. Rath v. Rath, 2016 ND 71, 877 N.W.2d 298, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        Subsection (5) did not violate defendant’s constitutional right to due process because defendant was charged with violating temporary disorderly conduct orders issued under subsection (4) before the hearing on the orders could be held under subsection (5), and she was ultimately convicted of violating the orders. State v. Kenny, 2019 ND 218, 932 N.W.2d 516, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Employee’s restraining order was affirmed because the customer’s actions of hitting the employee satisfied the definition of disorderly conduct, when hitting the employee constituted an intrusive and unwanted act intended to adversely affect the safety and security of the employee, and a disorderly conduct restraining order did not require a pattern of behavior.
   Wetzel v. Schlenvogt, 2005 ND 190, 705 N.W.2d 836, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 230</cite> (N.D. 2005).

        Evidence showed that defendant knew about the restraining order and contacted his ex-girlfriend on February 20, 2008, for a purpose other than contacting the child; viewing the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict, a reasonable factfinder could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

        Neighbor alleged reasonable grounds for the district court to believe the homeowner engaged in disorderly conduct under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31.2-01(4); considering the homeowner’s statements coupled with his video recording of the neighbor and her mother in the neighbor’s yard as well as his pattern of behavior toward the neighbor dating back to 2006, there was sufficient evidence to establish reasonable grounds to believe the homeowner engaged in disorderly conduct, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31.2-01(5)(d).

        It is not enough that the petitioner for a restraining order wants the other person out of the petitioner’s life; conversely, because of previous physical or emotional abuse, in some instances the person restrained is well aware that his or her mere presence is sufficient to cause such emotional stress as to adversely affect the safety, security, or privacy of the other person, and a restraining order might well be justified in that instance. Although a party may not welcome an ex-spouse’s mere presence or telephone calls, a certain amount of contact must be expected when there is split custody of the children and visitation exchanges; unless there is evidence that the contacts rise to the level of disorderly conduct under the statute, a “no contact” order is not authorized.

        To the extent that a district court said that an ex-husband had to have the intent to hurt a former wife, as opposed to an intent to affect her safety, security, or privacy, in order to grant a disorderly conduct restraining order, the district court appeared to have misapplied or misinterpreted this statute. An appellate court's grant of discretion was strictly conditioned on the district court's proper application and interpretation of the applicable law in reaching its final decision to grant or deny a disorderly conduct restraining order.

        Where a former boyfriend alleged that a former girlfriend yelled at him at his job, continued to leave messages at his home, stared at him and his new lover, and engaged in actions towards others, there was insufficient evidence to support a trial court’s decision to grant a disorderly conduct restraining order under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31.2-01; the allegations were vague, did not show fear, and failed to state the specifics of the conversations or the amount of phone calls received.

        While the record may have included some evidence showing appellant's actions could have affected petitioner's safety, security, or privacy, petitioner's lack of specific testimony and the district court's conclusory statements on the record did not adequately show how N.D.C.C. § 12.1-31.2-01 was satisfied. Therefore, petitioner failed as a matter of law to allege the specific facts or threats necessary to support his petition for a disorderly conduct restraining order, and the district court abused it discretion in issuing the restraining order.

        Where a wife alleged that the wife’s husband put pieces of crushed up abortion pills in a bowl of soup the husband served to the wife and that the husband raped the wife multiple times during their two-week marriage, it was not an abuse of discretion to issue a two-year disorderly conduct restraining order against the husband, because the wife’s testimony about the incidents provided reasonable grounds to believe that the husband had engaged in disorderly conduct.

       If an individual who is charged with or arrested for a crime of violence or threat of violence, stalking, harassment, or a sex offense is released from custody before arraignment or trial, the court authorizing the release of the individual shall consider and may issue an order prohibiting the individual from having contact with the victim. The order must contain the court’s directives and must inform the individual that any violation of the order constitutes a criminal offense. The state’s attorney shall provide a copy of the order to the victim. The court shall determine at the time of the individual’s arraignment whether an order issued pursuant to this section will be extended. If the court issues an order pursuant to this section before the time the individual is charged, the order expires at the individual’s arraignment or within seventy-two hours of issuance if charges against the individual are not filed.

       Class AA felony, for which a maximum penalty of life imprisonment without parole may be imposed. The court must designate whether the life imprisonment sentence imposed is with or without an opportunity for parole. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12-59-05, a person found guilty of a class AA felony and who receives a sentence of life imprisonment with parole, shall not be eligible to have that person’s sentence considered by the parole board for thirty years, less sentence reduction earned for good conduct, after that person’s admission to the penitentiary.

       Infraction, for which a maximum fine of one thousand dollars may be imposed. Any person convicted of an infraction who, within one year before commission of the infraction of which the person was convicted, has been convicted previously at least twice of the same offense classified as an infraction may be sentenced as though convicted of a class B misdemeanor. If the prosecution contends that the infraction is punishable as a class B misdemeanor, the complaint must specify the offense is a misdemeanor.

       <p>
        Sentence of ten years, with four years suspended and five years of supervised probation, for defendant’s conviction of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance was affirmed because defendant’s sentence was within the range of sentences for a Class A Felony, and defendant failed to show that the district court substantially relied upon an impermissible factor in sentencing; the trial court determined defendant was engaged in an ongoing enterprise of selling drugs and this was a reasonable inference based upon the evidence in the record and was a factor the trial court could consider during sentencing, and the trial court also considered at least seven other factors in sentencing defendant, all of which were listed in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04" target="_self">12.1-32-04</a></cite>.

        District court erred in sentencing defendant to life in prison because his sentence for attempted murder exceeded the statutory maximum sentence allowed for a class A felony and was illegal where, while the State gave notice it was requesting defendant be sentenced as a habitual offender and the court subsequently entered an amended judgment stating defendant was a habitual offender, he was not originally sentenced as a habitual offender.

        The serious nature of sexual assault is underscored by the North Dakota legislature classifying them as class AA felonies, carrying a potential sentence of life imprisonment without parole under N.D.C.C. §§ 12.1-20-03(3)(a) and 12.1-32-01(1). The North Dakota legislature has defined force to mean physical action in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-04(11), and it is the force or physical action by defendant which must compel the victim to submit to a sex act for a crime to be committed under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(a); in the absence of force or threats of death or serious bodily injury, there is no crime under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(a).

       Credit against any sentence to a term of imprisonment must be given by the court to a defendant for all time spent in custody as a result of the criminal charge for which the sentence was imposed or as a result of the conduct on which such charge was based. “Time spent in custody” includes time spent in custody in a jail or mental institution for the offense charged, whether that time is spent prior to trial, during trial, pending sentence, or pending appeal. The total amount of credit the defendant is entitled to for time spent in custody and any credit for sentence reduction under section 12-44.1-32 or 12-54.1-01 the defendant is entitled to must be stated in the criminal judgment.

       A court, upon application or its own motion, may defer imposition of sentence. The court must place the defendant on probation during the period of deferment. An order deferring imposition of sentence is reviewable upon appeal from a verdict or judgment. In any subsequent prosecution, for any other offense, the prior conviction for which imposition of sentence is deferred may be pleaded and proved, and has the same effect as if probation had not been granted or the information or indictment dismissed under section 12.1-32-07.1.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-02ol15">
       A court may, prior to imposition of sentence, order the convicted offender committed to an appropriate licensed public or private institution for diagnostic testing for such period of time as may be necessary, but not to exceed thirty days. The court may, by subsequent order, extend the period of commitment for not to exceed thirty additional days. The court may also order such diagnostic testing without ordering commitment to an institution. Validity of a sentence must not be challenged on the ground that diagnostic testing was not performed pursuant to this subsection.

      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-02ol16">
       All sentences imposed must be accompanied by a written statement by the court setting forth the reasons for imposing the particular sentence. The statement must become part of the record of the case.

       A person who is convicted of a felony and sentenced to imprisonment for not more than three hundred sixty days is deemed to have been convicted of a misdemeanor.

       A court shall order a defendant to pay fifty dollars to the department of corrections and rehabilitation at the time a presentence investigation is initiated to partially defray the costs incurred by the department for the preparation of the presentence report. The court may also order that any additional costs incurred by the department relating to the presentence investigation and report be paid by the defendant at a rate of payment up to the full costs of conducting the investigation and preparing the report as established by the department.

A presentence investigation for a charge under section 12.1-20-03 must include a risk assessment. A court may order the inclusion of a risk assessment in any presentence investigation. In all felony or class A misdemeanor offenses, in which force, as defined in section 12.1-01-04, or threat of force is an element of the offense or in violation of section 12.1-22-02, or an attempt to commit the offenses, a court, unless a presentence investigation has been ordered, must receive a criminal record report before the sentencing of the defendant. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, the criminal record report must be conducted by the department of corrections and rehabilitation after consulting with the prosecuting attorney regarding the defendant’s criminal record. The criminal record report must be in writing, filed with the court before sentencing, and made a part of the court’s record of the sentencing proceeding.

        Appellate review of a criminal sentence is confined to determining whether the judge acted within the limits prescribed by statute, or substantially relied on an impermissible factor. State v. Ennis, 464 N.W.2d 378, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 261</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant filed a second motion for credit for time served under N.D. R. Crim. P. 35(b), defendant's counsel agreed the sentence was discretionary and not mandatory under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-02(2). Defendant's motion for reduction of sentence under rule 35(b) was discretionary and therefore not appealable. State v. Lowe, 2015 ND 126, 863 N.W.2d 525, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 2015).

       <p>
        Subsection (9) was ambiguous as applied to the facts of the case because the district court held that defendant was not entitled to the benefit of a misdemeanor sentence, but in its oral pronouncement stated defendant would keep his “misdemeanor disposition”; because no adequate alternative remedy existed, defendant's request on appeal was treated as seeking a writ of supervision based on the oral pronouncement, and the supreme court exercised its discretionary supervisory jurisdiction. State v. Rath, 2017 ND 213, 901 N.W.2d 51, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 2017).

State v. Mees, 272 N.W.2d 61, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence was imposed, and absent a motion by defendant, imprisonment commenced when trial judge pronounced original sentence, even though trial judge did not prepare written criminal judgment until after he changed original sentence, where after original sentencing defendant was held in county jail awaiting transportation to penitentiary. State v. Bryan, 316 N.W.2d 335, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1982).

        Where state court sentenced defendant to imprisonment, and a federal court sentenced defendant on a federal charge and recommended that federal sentence be served at state penitentiary and that it run concurrently with state court sentence, state court did not have authority, after its original sentence had commenced, to amend its original sentence so as not to commence until after defendant was released by federal authorities.

        In a case where defendant was convicted of violating a municipal ordinance, a district court erred in failing to enter an appropriate order deferring imposition of sentence; the district court entered a “criminal judgment” that also purported to defer imposition of defendant's sentence, but it is unclear what was being deferred since a sentence was actually imposed.

       <p>
        It was error to impose a mandatory minimum sentence because defendant’s prior deferred imposition of sentence could not be used to trigger the sentence once defendant completed probation and the case was dismissed, as the phrase “the prior conviction for which imposition of sentence is deferred” in N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-02(4) referred to a deferred sentence that had not been dismissed.

        Where defendant was sentenced to 60 days, his felony conviction for issuing a check without sufficient funds was reduced to a misdemeanor conviction under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-02(9); accordingly, defendant was convicted of a felony and probable cause to believe defendant was a felon in possession of a firearm existed under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01(2), and the district court’s order discharging defendant from the charge of felon in possession of a firearm was reversed.

Defendant’s prior sentence for issuing a check without sufficient funds was not illegal because the district court only addressed the conditions of probation under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-07 and did not address whether defendant could possess or own a firearm after probation. N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01 explicitly prohibited defendant from possessing firearms after he had been convicted of a felony reduced to a misdemeanor under N.D.C.C.§ 12.1-32-02(9) and defendant was presumed to know the law and could not claim that the prohibition did not apply to him.

        District court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing defendant as an habitual offender because, although defendant argued that his prior out-of-state convictions were misdemeanors for the purpose of determining whether he was an habitual offender, defendant’s prior convictions had potential punishable sentences of at least five years, and were considered felonies under the habitual offender statute.

        This section applies only if the possession of a dangerous weapon, an explosive, or a firearm is an essential element of the crime committed or if the trier of fact makes a special finding that in the course of committing the offense the accused was in possession of a dangerous weapon, an explosive, or a firearm.

        This section, when viewed as a whole, indicates that a court may not suspend a sentence imposed pursuant to its provisions; and this section would prevail over the more general provisions contained in former N.D.C.C. ch. 12-53, which set forth the power of the court to suspend the execution of a sentence.

        By enacting this section, the legislature removed all discretionary power from the trial court as to the minimum sentence to be imposed upon an individual whose crime falls within the purview of the statute; it did not, however, place that discretion into the hands of the jury to decide whether the sentence should be imposed.

        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident involving injury and aggravated reckless driving, defendant’s sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing as the district court substantially relied upon an impermissible factor in sentencing defendant to jail because the case did not implicate an offense involving domestic violence, sexual offender registration, or mandatory terms of incarceration; defendant was not charged with, nor did he plead guilty to, any offense involving a dangerous weapon; and the dangerous weapon exception to the presumptive probation statute did not apply in defendant’s case.

        Information which alleged the essential elements of both the reckless endangerment statute, N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-17-03, and the armed offender statute, gave defendant sufficient notice of the possible application of this section to his reckless endangerment charge, even though the information did not contain the specific language “threatens or menaces another with imminent bodily injury with a dangerous weapon” used in this section. State v. Meier, 447 N.W.2d 506, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 196</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant argued that informations lacked proper allegations of firearm use, making a minimum mandatory sentence for armed offenders inapplicable to his case, the informations contained proper firearm allegations and the minimum mandatory sentence for armed offenders was correctly applied where it was stated in the informations that defendant placed the victims in fear of their safety by “discharging a firearm in the immediate area of the victim in the City of Sheldon causing the victim to flee in fear of his life.”

       After a defendant has been convicted of a felony, the court may order the defendant to repay all or part of any reward paid by a qualified local program. In determining whether the defendant must repay the reward or part of the reward, the court shall consider:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-02.2ol11a">
         The ability of the defendant to make the payments, including any financial hardship that payment may cause to the defendant’s dependents.

       “A qualified local program” means a program approved by the attorney general to receive repayment of rewards. The attorney general shall consider the organization, continuity, leadership, community support, and general conduct of the program to determine whether the repayments will be spent to further crime prevention purposes of the program. The attorney general also shall determine that the qualified local program provides rewards to persons who report information concerning criminal activity and whether that information substantially leads to defendants being charged with felonies.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-02.2ol13">
       If the court determines that a defendant is capable of repaying all or any part of a reward paid by a qualified local program, the judgment must include a statement of the amount owed, the identity of the qualified local program, and a schedule, if any, of payments to be made by the defendant. The clerk of court may establish an account within which to deposit repayments of rewards and at least quarterly shall pay over to each qualified local program the sums that have been collected for the benefit of that program.

       A judgment that includes a repayment of reward, either alone or in conjunction with section 29-26-22, may be docketed and thereafter constitutes a lien upon the real estate of the defendant in the same manner as a judgment for money rendered in a civil action.

    Factors to be considered in sentencing decision.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The following factors, or the converse thereof where appropriate, while not controlling the discretion of the court, shall be accorded weight in making determinations regarding the desirability of sentencing an offender to imprisonment:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol11">
       The defendant’s criminal conduct neither caused nor threatened serious harm to another person or his property.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol12">
       The defendant did not plan or expect that his criminal conduct would cause or threaten serious harm to another person or his property.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol13">
       The defendant acted under strong provocation.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol14">
       There were substantial grounds which, though insufficient to establish a legal defense, tend to excuse or justify the defendant’s conduct.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol15">
       The victim of the defendant’s conduct induced or facilitated its commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol16">
       The defendant has made or will make restitution or reparation to the victim of his conduct for the damage or injury which was sustained.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol17">
       The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity, or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present offense.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol18">
       The defendant’s conduct was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol19">
       The character, history, and attitudes of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another crime.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol110">
       The defendant is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol111">
       The imprisonment of the defendant would entail undue hardship to himself or his dependents.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol112">
       The defendant is elderly or in poor health.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol113">
       The defendant did not abuse a public position of responsibility or trust.
      </li>
      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04ol114">
       The defendant cooperated with law enforcement authorities by bringing other offenders to justice, or otherwise cooperated.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Nothing herein shall be deemed to require explicit reference to these factors in a presentence report or by the court at sentencing.

        The trial court did not abuse its discretion by not considering the victim’s age when sentencing defendant on the theory that the seriousness of gross sexual imposition diminishes as the victim’s age approaches 15; the gross sexual imposition statute, N.D.C.C. §
   12.1-20-03, makes no distinction in punishment when the victim is less than 15 years old and the list of factors a court shall consider in sentencing in this section does not mention the age of the victim.

         Discretion of Trial Court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Sentence within the minimum and maximum statutory limits is within the discretion of the trial court, and will not be set aside unless it exceeds the statutory limit or unless the trial court substantially relied on an impermissible sentencing factor. State v. Garcia, 1997 ND 60, 561 N.W.2d 599, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 874, 118 S. Ct. 193, 139 L. Ed. 2d 131, 1997 U.S. LEXIS 5532 (U.S. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although trial courts should articulate reasons for imposing a specific sentence, a 50-year sentence is within the range of permissible sentences for a class AA felony, and where the court’s decision does not reflect that the court relied on any impermissible factors in imposing the sentence, the court did not abuse its discretion. State v. Magnuson, 1997 ND 228, 571 N.W.2d 642, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 277</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err by imposing the mandatory minimum one-year prison sentence because there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict; the district court indicated it had considered the discretionary sentencing factors, and defendant received the mandatory minimum sentence required by the criminal vehicular injury statute. State v. Montplaisir, 2015 ND 237, 869 N.W.2d 435, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 242</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly sentenced defendant to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole because the law of the case doctrine barred his argument that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his convictions since it was beyond the scope of the remand ordered in his first appeal, the court’s statements at the second sentencing were to inform defendant that it was not going to retry the case based on evidence not presented at trial and could not be construed to mean the court was reimposing the same sentence as the previous judge without evaluating the evidence, and, based on its familiarity with the record and underlying circumstances, the court adequately considered the facts of the case and the statutory factors. State v. Lyon, 2020 ND 34, 938 N.W.2d 908, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 33</cite> (N.D. 2020).

         Domestic Abuse.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Acts of domestic abuse by the defendant against the victim were not impermissibly considered in sentencing the defendant. State v. Steinbach, 1998 ND 18, 575 N.W.2d 193, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1998).

        At sentencing, a defendant who has pleaded guilty is not entitled to assert he actually committed some lesser crime and should be sentenced accordingly. By pleading guilty, he has admitted guilt of the greater offense. State v. Sisson, 1997 ND 158, 567 N.W.2d 839, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1997).

       <p>
        Court may not consider fact that defendant refused to plead guilty and went to trial, or that he chose to have his attorney speak instead of speaking for himself when given the opportunity to speak prior to sentencing, when court determines the sentence. State v. Hass, 268 N.W.2d 456, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A guilty plea by a defendant is not to be considered cooperation for sentencing purposes. State v. Bell, 540 N.W.2d 599, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        In determining the desirability of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, this section permits the trial court to consider matters subsequent to the commission of the offense. State v. Sheldon, 312 N.W.2d 367, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 415</cite> (N.D. 1981).

         Permissible Factors.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section sets forth the factors to be considered in sentencing decisions. Those factors include, among several others, the defendant’s history of prior delinquency or criminal activity, whether he has led a law abiding life, and whether the character, history, and attitudes of the defendant indicate that he is likely to commit another crime. A trial judge should be influenced by these factors. State v. Woehlhoff, 473 N.W.2d 446, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where ordained minister introduced the subject of his religion into the sentencing hearing in an effort to convince the court to mitigate his sentence, judge’s comment about “Christendom” was merely a response to this plea and did not illustrate substantial reliance on religion as a factor in sentencing; the comment was made in the context of discussing defendant’s position of trust within the church community and illustrated the judge’s awareness of the factors that the legislature has decided “shall be afforded weight.” State v. McClung, 529 N.W.2d 852, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not err in determining that defendant’s parental relationship with his daughter was a position of responsibility and trust which he had violated, and such a violation was an appropriate factor for consideration in sentencing. State v. Bell, 540 N.W.2d 599, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly considered a criminal conviction which was pending appeal during the sentencing hearing, and defendant’s reliance on N.D.C.C. § 39-06-30 which deals with the timing of reports of convictions to the appropriate licensing authority for purposes of license suspensions and revocations was misplaced as it did not define a conviction for purposes of sentencing a defendant under Title 12.1 of the N.D.C.C. State v. Ellis, 2001 ND 84, 625 N.W.2d 544, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of ten years, with four years suspended and five years of supervised probation, for defendant’s conviction of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance was affirmed because defendant’s sentence was within the range of sentences for a Class A Felony, and defendant failed to show that the district court substantially relied upon an impermissible factor in sentencing; the trial court determined defendant was engaged in an ongoing enterprise of selling drugs and this was a reasonable inference based upon the evidence in the record and was a factor the trial court could consider during sentencing, and the trial court also considered at least seven other factors in sentencing defendant, all of which were listed in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-04" target="_self">12.1-32-04</a></cite>.
   State v. Hoverson, 2006 ND 49, 710 N.W.2d 890, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant’s request to deviate from a plea agreement because the trial court considered defendant’s criminal history, the commission of new offenses, and defendant’s apparent inability to follow the law.
   State v. Henes, 2009 ND 42, 763 N.W.2d 502, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a gross sexual imposition with a child less than six years of age case, because defendant was living with the child’s mother at the relevant times and there was evidence that several of the sexual acts occurred when defendant was watching the child while her mother was attending school, defendant was essentially in a parental relationship with the child; thus, the trial court’s reference to a position of trust in sentencing defendant was not an impermissible consideration and the trial court did not err in relying on that factor in sentencing defendant.
   State v. Huether, 2010 ND 233, 790 N.W.2d 901, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 236</cite> (N.D. 2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was under supervised probation for five years following a gross sexual imposition conviction and State subsequently moved to revoke probation because defendant violated the terms of probation by having contact with minor females on Facebook, possessing sexually stimulating material, and committing gross sexual imposition, where the trial court found that defendant exhibited predatory behavior that warranted revocation of probation and further found that defendant was a dangerous person and resentenced him to 20 years in prison on each count, to run consecutively, the trial court’s reliance on defendant’s likelihood to re-offend sexually fell within the converse of statutory factors N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-04(8) and (9). Thus, the trial court’s reliance on defendant’s likelihood to re-offend sexually stemmed from the factors listed under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-04 and were not impermissible factors.
   State v. Gonzalez, 2011 ND 143, 799 N.W.2d 402, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in resentencing defendant because it did not need to analyze each sentencing factor; the record did not show the district court substantially relied on an impermissible factor; and the district court considered defendant’s criminal history. State v. Dubois, 2019 ND 284, 936 N.W.2d 380, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 291</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly considered defendant’s prior convictions without first ascertaining whether they were uncounseled because defendant did not show that his prior convictions were uncounseled or that he was given an enhanced sentence based upon his criminal history, the record showed the court’s appropriate consideration of defendant’s prior convictions. State v. Aune, 2021 ND 7, 953 N.W.2d 601, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly considered defendant’s prior criminal convictions as part of her criminal history at sentencing because they were not relied upon to enhance her term of incarceration, defendant did not show that the prior convictions were, in fact, uncounseled or that the district court abused its discretion in applying the sentencing factors in an illegal manner, her sentence was below the statutory maximum and within statutory limits, and her prior convictions were properly considered by the district court as her criminal history and as one of many sentencing factors. State v. Evanson, 2021 ND 4, 953 N.W.2d 607, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 4</cite> (N.D. 2021).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Resentence based solely on nonpayment of the fines could not exceed six months imprisonment; however, defendant’s failure to get permission for his moves and to report were reasons which authorized revocation of probation and imposition of the original sentence, for over five years. These were the significant factors that the trial court considered in sentencing. Most of the revocation hearing focused on defendant’s failure to keep in contact with his probation officer. Because there was nothing to indicate that the trial court relied solely on an impermissible factor, and there were proper factors which the court obviously considered in resentencing, the court would decline to vacate defendant’s sentence.

        District court did not substantially comply with N.D. R. Crim.

        The holding in State v. Nace, 371 N.W.2d 129 (N.D. 1985), citing N.D.R.Crim.P. 35(a), that a post-conviction proceeding “is also available to collaterally attack a sentence where it ‘exceeds the maximum authorized by law’” has been superseded by this section.

        The one-year sentence limitation in subsection 3 of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-11 applies only to a sentence for imprisonment.

        District court properly refused to allow defendant to withdraw his guilty plea on the failure-to-register charge because he offered no support for his argument that he was incorrectly informed of the penalty for pleading guilty to that charge as the permissive probationary provisions were not applicable, and his probationary sentence was appropriately categorized as mandatory.

        By the 1989 amendments, the legislature gave the trial court the ability to impose a maximum probation sentence separate from and in addition to its ability to impose a maximum imprisonment sentence.

        Defendant’s sentence entered for defendant’s DUI conviction was illegal and, thus, the trial court should not have denied defendant’s postconviction relief application and was required to resentence defendant. Under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-06" target="_self">12.1-32-06</a></cite>.1(1), defendant’s probationary sentence for a felony conviction could not exceed five years from the end of the DUI sentence, but the trial court ordered that the five-year probationary period start running only after defendant completed a 10-year sentence on a manslaughter conviction, which meant that the DUI probationary period could not be completed within five years after defendant’s five-year DUI sentence ended.

        District court erred in imposing a five-year sentence of supervised probation because aggravated assault—domestic violence was a class C felony that fell within the "any other felony offense" category, which limited defendant's supervised probation to three years for his crime.

        Defendant was not entitled to be resentenced to probation because (1) any sentence available when defendant was originally sentenced could be imposed upon revocation of probation, (2) defendant could only receive two probation periods, defendant’s first period had been revoked, and defendant was serving a second period when probation was revoked, so the court could not sentence defendant to a third period, and (3) defendant’s sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole, after his murder conviction, was within the statutory range.

        In a case where defendant was convicted under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03, an illegal sentence was imposed because defendant had served two probation periods authorized by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-06" target="_self">12.1-32-06</a></cite>.1 prior to his 2012 resentencing due to a revocation, and a trial court was unable to impose a third period of probation.

       When the court imposes probation upon conviction for a felony offense subject to section 12.1-32-09.1 or 12.1-32-02.1, a second or subsequent violation of section 12.1-17-07.1, a second or subsequent violation of any domestic violence protection order, a violation of chapter 12.1-41, a violation of section 14-09-22, or a felony offense under chapter 39-08, the court shall place the defendant under the supervision and management of the department of corrections and rehabilitation. When the court imposes probation upon conviction or order of disposition in all other felony cases, the court may place the defendant under the supervision and management of the department of corrections and rehabilitation. In class A misdemeanor cases, the court may place the defendant under the supervision and management of the department of corrections and rehabilitation or other responsible party. In all other cases, the court may place the defendant under the supervision and management of a community corrections program other than the department of corrections and rehabilitation. A community corrections program means a program for the supervision of a defendant, including monitoring and enforcement of terms and conditions of probation set by the court.

      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-07ol12">
       The conditions of probation must be such as the court in its discretion deems reasonably necessary to ensure that the defendant will lead a law-abiding life or to assist the defendant to do so. The court shall provide as an explicit condition of every probation that the defendant not commit another offense during the period for which the probation remains subject to revocation. The court shall order supervision costs and fees of not less than fifty-five dollars per month unless the court makes a specific finding on record that the imposition of fees will result in an undue hardship. If the offender has not paid the full amount of supervision fees and costs before completion or termination of probation, the court may issue an order, after opportunity for hearing, to determine the amount of supervision fees and costs that are unpaid. The order may be filed, transcribed, and enforced by the department of corrections and rehabilitation in the same manner as civil judgments rendered by a district court of this state.

      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-07ol13">
       The court shall provide as an explicit condition of every probation that the defendant may not possess a firearm, destructive device, or other dangerous weapon while the defendant is on probation. Except when the offense is a misdemeanor offense under section 12.1-17-01, 12.1-17-01.1, 12.1-17-01.2, 12.1-17-05, or 12.1-17-07.1, or chapter 14-07.1, the court may waive this condition of probation if the defendant has pled guilty to, or has been found guilty of, a misdemeanor or infraction offense, the misdemeanor or infraction is the defendant’s first offense, and the court has made a specific finding on the record before imposition of a sentence or a probation that there is good cause to waive the condition. The court may not waive this condition of probation if the court places the defendant under the supervision and management of the department of corrections and rehabilitation. The court shall provide as an explicit condition of probation that the defendant may not willfully defraud a urine test administered as a condition of probation. Unless waived on the record by the court, the court shall also provide as a condition of probation that the defendant undergo various agreed-to community constraints and conditions as intermediate measures of the department of corrections and rehabilitation to avoid revocation, which may include:

        Trial court’s imposition of the probation condition prohibiting defendant from entering a specific geographic location was reasonably related to the goals of his probation, protected the rights of law-abiding citizens from the effects of his refuse hoarding behavior, and had only limited restrictions on his right to associate with the property owner; therefore, the restriction was constitutional and the trial court acted within its sentencing authority.

        In a case where defendant was placed on probation after he was convicted of two counts of gross sexual imposition for engaging in a sexual act with a female under the age of 15, because the conditions of defendant's probation included that he submit to searches of his person, residence, and vehicle, with or without a warrant, and that he not have contact with minor females, telephone the victim, or utilize 900 telephone numbers, the conditions of defendant's probation gave him notice that his cell phones would be subject to search; thus, the search of defendant's cell phones was within the scope of the conditions of his probation, and the conditions were authorized by this statute.

        Defendant was properly prohibited from arguing a mistake of law defense under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-09 because his offense of possession of a firearm by a felon under N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01(2) was a strict liability offense. Defendant’s prior sentence for issuing a check without sufficient funds was not illegal because the district court only addressed the conditions of probation under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-07 and did not address whether defendant could possess or own a firearm after probation. N.D.C.C. § 62.1-02-01 explicitly prohibited defendant from possessing firearms after he had been convicted of a felony reduced to a misdemeanor under N.D.C.C.§ 12.1-32-02(9) and defendant was presumed to know the law and could not claim that the prohibition did not apply to him.

        A state must give a probationer some type of formal notice of noncriminal conduct which would result in the revocation of probation, while recognizing that a proscription against criminal activity is an implied condition of every probation, as no person has the right to commit a crime. State v. Kunkel, 455 N.W.2d 213, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Supreme court will not reverse an order revoking probation for committing a criminal offense where the condition (that the probationer not commit crimes) is not included in the probation certificate.

       <p>
        The requirement of former subsection 3 (now subsection 5) that a probationer receive a written certificate of probation conditions was meant to apply to those instances in which the court, as permitted by statute, proscribes or requires certain noncriminal conduct.

        Subsection 5 wasn’t violated when the court mailed the defendant a copy of his second N.D.R.Crim.P. 35 order reducing his sentence and releasing him on probation subject to the same conditions as originally imposed; at the re-sentencing hearing the court reiterated the specific conditions defendant had received at his original sentencing and stated that if he were to violate any of those conditions again he would be re-sentenced with no clemency.

        Where, finding conditions imposed by the probation officer too restrictive, the defendant refused to sign his probation agreement, provoking the first revocation hearing at which the defendant agreed to abide by the conditions and made no objection to the prior procedure, it was clear that the trial court and the defendant knew the terms of probation, the court ordered and adapted them, the defendant agreed to follow them, and probation was not revoked. Thus the improper completion of the probation agreement and imposition of probation conditions by the probation officer did not have a significant impact on a subsequent revocation, the defendant’s substantial liberty rights were not affected, and there was not obvious error.

       <p>
        The supreme court has long held that this section allows a trial court to impose a harsher sentence upon revocation of probation and, therefore, it was not error for a trial court to order a defendant to serve some of the remaining portions of his prison sentences consecutively to each other upon revocation even though the original plea agreement required that all sentences be imposed concurrently.

        Because subsection 4 of this section (now subsection 6) gave defendant notice that violation of the conditions of his probation could result in the imposition of a harsher sentence upon revocation of his probation, defendant had no legitimate expectation in the finality of his sentence and the district court’s imposition of a harsher sentence upon revocation of probation was not prohibited by the double jeopardy clause.

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court’s decision to resentence defendant to twenty years did not subject him to multiple punishments for the same offense, and accordingly, the trial court did not violate defendant’s double jeopardy rights given that a sentence which includes probation is not final and resentencing a defendant to a harsher sentence reflects the trial court’s need to alter a defendant’s sentence in light of the fact that its initial sentence of probation was not effective.

        While the standard of review of a probation revocation is an abuse of discretion, revocation proceedings encompass a two-step analysis which requires a bifurcated review on appeal: first, the supreme court must review the trial court’s factual determination that the defendant violated the terms of his probation, and then the trial court’s discretionary determination that the violation warrants revocation.

        Contempt was not an available remedy for a burglary victim as he was not a party to the criminal prosecution and did not suffer an injury recognized by law as a result of the district court’s decision to terminate the accused’s probation; therefore, the victim did not have standing to challenge the district court’s order. The victim’s rights enunciated in N.D.C.C. ch. 12.1-34 did not give the victim standing under N.D.R.Crim.P. 35, the court’s inherent authority to correct fraud, or N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-07(7) to contest the court’s order terminating the accused’s probation and dismissing the criminal action against him.

        In a case where defendant was convicted under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03, an illegal sentence was imposed because defendant had served two probation periods authorized by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-06" target="_self">12.1-32-06</a></cite>.1 prior to his 2012 resentencing due to a revocation, and a trial court was unable to impose a third period of probation.

       <p>
        Plain language of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-07(6) provides a district court with the distinct alternatives of continuing existing probation or revoking probation and resentencing the defendant. Therefore, when the district court revokes probation and resentences a defendant, the existing probationary period ends and the district court may not order the defendant to complete the unserved portion of the existing probationary term.

        Once a violation of a condition of probation is established, the trial court is authorized to revoke an order suspending a sentence or an order suspending the imposition of a sentence, or to continue probation on the same or different conditions. State v. Saavedra, 406 N.W.2d 667, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 338</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Where the probation officer testified that he requested the defendant to provide a urine sample for a drug test and gave him two opportunities to comply, but he did not comply with the first request and did not show up for a second appointment, the trial court’s finding that the defendant violated a condition of his probation by failing to submit to a drug test was not clearly erroneous. State v. Saavedra, 406 N.W.2d 667, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 338</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Defendant violated the terms of his probation by failing to make any restitution payments. State v. Gates, 540 N.W.2d 134, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 199</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A probationer does not violate his or her conditions of probation for conduct committed prior to the imposition of sentence. Therefore, offense committed six months before imposition of probation sentence could not be used to revoke probation. State v. Ballensky, 1998 ND 197, 586 N.W.2d 163, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

A person convicted of gross sexual imposition under subdivision a of subsection 1 of section 12.1-20-03 is not entitled to early termination of probation pursuant to this section, unless the court finds after at least eight years of supervised probation that further supervision would impose a manifest injustice. Every defendant who has fulfilled the conditions of probation for the entire period, or who has been discharged from probation prior to termination of the probation period, may at any time be permitted in the discretion of the court to withdraw the defendant’s plea of guilty. The court may in its discretion set aside the verdict of guilty. In either case, the court may dismiss the information or indictment against the defendant. The court may, upon its own motion or upon application by the defendant and before dismissing the information or indictment, reduce to a misdemeanor a felony conviction for which the plea of guilty has been withdrawn or set aside. The defendant must then be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense or crime of which the defendant has been convicted except as provided by sections 12.1-32-15 and 62.1-02-01.

        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident involving injury and aggravated reckless driving, defendant’s sentence was vacated and the case was remanded for resentencing as the district court substantially relied upon an impermissible factor in sentencing defendant to jail because the case did not implicate an offense involving domestic violence, sexual offender registration, or mandatory terms of incarceration; defendant was not charged with, nor did he plead guilty to, any offense involving a dangerous weapon; and the dangerous weapon exception to the presumptive probation statute did not apply in defendant’s case.

       Before imposing restitution or reparation as a sentence or condition of probation, the court shall hold a hearing on the matter with notice to the prosecuting attorney and to the defendant as to the nature and amount of restitution. The court, when sentencing a person adjudged guilty of criminal activities that have resulted in pecuniary damages, in addition to any other sentence the court may impose, shall order that the defendant make restitution to the victim or other recipient as determined by the court. Restitution must include payment to the owner of real property that is contaminated by the defendant in the manufacturing of methamphetamine for the cost of removing the contamination and returning the property to the property’s condition before contamination and to any other person that has incurred costs in decontaminating the property. In determining the amount of restitution, the court shall take into account the reasonable damages sustained by the victim or victims of the criminal offense, which damages are limited to those directly related to the criminal offense and expenses actually incurred as a direct result of the defendant’s criminal action. This can include an amount equal to the cost of necessary and related professional services and devices relating to physical, psychiatric, and psychological care. The defendant may be required as part of the sentence imposed by the court to pay the prescribed treatment costs for a victim of a sexual offense as defined in chapters 12.1-20 and 12.1-27.2.

      <li id="t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-08ol12">
       When the restitution ordered by the court under subsection 1 is the result of a finding that the defendant issued a check or draft without sufficient funds or without an account, the court shall impose as costs the greater of the sum of ten dollars or an amount equal to twenty-five percent of the amount of restitution ordered. The costs imposed under this subsection, however, may not exceed one thousand dollars. The state-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under this subsection to the state treasurer for deposit in the restitution collection assistance fund. The funds deposited into the restitution collection assistance fund are appropriated to the judicial branch on a continuing basis for the purpose of defraying expenses incident to the collection of restitution, including operating expenses and the compensation of additional necessary personnel. The state’s attorneys and county-employed clerks of district court shall remit the funds collected as costs under this subsection to the county treasurer to be deposited in the county general fund.

         Under section 12.1-32-07, the court may order that the defendant reimburse indigent defense costs and expenses as a condition of probation. Unless it finds that there is no likelihood that the defendant is or will be able to pay attorney’s fees and expenses, the court, in its judgment of conviction, and in any order or amended judgment following a revocation or other postjudgment proceeding, shall notify the defendant, the defendant’s probation officer, and the prosecuting attorney of the presumed amount of costs and expenses to be reimbursed, as determined by the commission on legal counsel for indigents, and of the right to a hearing on the reimbursement amount. The reimbursement amount must include an application fee imposed under section 29-07-01.1 if the fee has not been paid before disposition of the case and the court has not waived payment of the fee. If the defendant or prosecutor requests a hearing within thirty days of receiving notice under this subdivision, the court shall schedule a hearing at which the actual amount of attorney’s fees and expenses must be shown. In determining the amount and method of reimbursement, the court shall consider the financial resources of the defendant and the nature of the burden that reimbursement of costs and expenses will impose.

         A defendant who is required to reimburse indigent defense costs and expenses as a condition of probation and who is not willfully in default in that reimbursement may at any time petition the court that imposed the condition to waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the costs and expenses. If the court is satisfied that reimbursement of the amount due will impose undue hardship on the defendant or the defendant’s immediate family, the court may waive reimbursement of all or any portion of the amount due or modify the method of payment.

The defendant may not perform reasonable assigned work in lieu of restitution or reparations unless the person entitled to restitution or reparations has consented in writing or on the record.

      The court shall fix the amount of restitution or reparation and shall fix the manner of performance of any condition or conditions of probation established pursuant to this subsection. The court shall order restitution be paid to the division of adult services for any benefits the division has paid or may pay under chapter 54-23.4 unless the court, on the record, directs otherwise. Any payments made pursuant to the order must be deducted from damages awarded in a civil action arising from the same incident. An order that a defendant make restitution or reparation as a sentence or condition of probation may, unless the court directs otherwise, be filed without filing fee, transcribed, and enforced by the person entitled to the restitution or reparation or by the division of adult services in the same manner as civil judgments rendered by the courts of this state may be enforced. Upon thirty days’ written notice to the victim’s last known address, the court may order the judgment imposing a duty to pay restitution or reparation be docketed in the same manner as a civil judgment under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.29.html#t29c29-26s29-26-22" target="_blank">29-26-22</a></cite>.1.

        N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-08(1), which requires a court to take into account the ability of the defendant to pay restitution, is unconstitutional in part. State v. Strom, 2019 ND 9, 921 N.W.2d 660, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        In a case involving the misapplication of entrusted property, restitution was properly ordered under this section for checks that an estate received for its interest in an oil well because there was no evidence presented showing that a deposit made was an oil check or that the remaining checks were deposited into the estate's accounts; however, defendant should not have been ordered to pay restitution for stock proceeds because the undisputed evidence showed that they were deposited in the estate's bank accounts. A check allegedly paid for a weed spraying business was never cashed, and the funds remained in the estate's bank account; therefore, that amount should also not have been included in the restitution. State v. Gates, 2015 ND 177, 865 N.W.2d 816, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2015), cert. denied, 577 U.S. 1075, 136 S. Ct. 819, 193 L.

       <p>
        District court abused its discretion in failing to consider N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-08(1)(b) when ordering restitution by sua sponte refusing to address factors found under § 12.1-32-08(1)(b), deeming it unnecessary under N.D. Const. art. I, § 25(1)(n), and not addressing whether defendant had the ability to pay even though he had raised the issue. State v. Blue, 2018 ND 171, 915 N.W.2d 122, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court concluded the district court did not abuse its discretion in fixing the amount of restitution without regard to defendant’s ability to pay. The Supreme Court resolved an irreconcilable conflict between N.D. Const. art. I, § 25(1)(n), and N.D.C.D. § 12.1-32-08(1) by interpreting the constitutional amendment as implicitly repealing the conflicting portion of the statute. State v. Strom, 2019 ND 9, 921 N.W.2d 660, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Amounts totaled $ 65,708.57 in restitution owed by defendant, based on the victims' testimony, and there was no explanation for why restitution was set $ 3,949.43 higher than that amount; this appeared to be a clerical error, which the district court could address on remand.

        A hearing under this section is not required where the issue of restitution or reparation has been voluntarily resolved between the state and defendant in a plea bargain. State v. Thorstad, 261 N.W.2d 899, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 906, 98 S. Ct. 2237, 56 L. Ed. 2d 404, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 1796 (U.S. 1978); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a case involving theft by deception, a district court was not required to conduct a restitution hearing to determine if defendant had the ability to pay since restitution payments were set forth specifically in a plea agreement; therefore, the district court did not err by revoking probation and imposing a one-year sentence when defendant failed to pay because defendant was presumed to have known about personal assets and liabilities upon entering into the agreement. State v. Nordahl, 2004 ND 106, 680 N.W.2d 247, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 2004).

       <p>
        Restitution hearing was required to be held prior to imposing restitution as a sentence where there was a dispute concerning the amount of restitution and whether or not the alleged damage to victim’s car occurred during defendant’s unauthorized use of the car. State v. Bergeron, 326 N.W.2d 684, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 390</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the amount of restitution has not been resolved through plea bargaining, a restitution hearing must be held prior to imposing restitution as a part of a sentence. State v. Steinolfson, 483 N.W.2d 182, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A restitution hearing is part of a sentencing, and a defendant has the right to be personally present at the hearing; where defendant was not present at the hearing at which restitution was ordered, the restitution order was properly revoked. State v. Kensmoe, 2001 ND 190, 636 N.W.2d 183, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>

        After assuring defendant that he would be given the opportunity to present his side of the case, the district court failed to do so, and thus the district court abused its discretion by cancelling the subsequent restitution hearing without giving defendant the opportunity to be heard. State v. Nelson, 2015 ND 301, 872 N.W.2d 613, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 309</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        Because defendant pled guilty with the understanding that the State had agreed to recommend a particular sentence, which included restitution, but the issue of restitution was not resolved by plea agreement, the only legal basis to award restitution was pursuant to this statute, which required a hearing before awarding restitution, and the district court failed to act within the limits set by this statute when it amended the criminal judgment to include restitution without holding a hearing on the factual basis for the amount of restitution and the causal relationship between the criminal acts and the restitution ordered. State v. Youngbird, 2021 ND 21, 955 N.W.2d 54, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 2021).

        Amended judgment ordering defendant to pay over $10,000 in restitution was improper pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-08(1) because district courts were not permitted to order a sentence, then later increase the sentence. Therefore, the district court abused its discretion in ordering restitution and later increasing it, without previously reserving the issue.

       Except in the most extraordinary cases, the court shall obtain a presentence report and may receive a diagnostic testing report under subsection 5 of section 12.1-32-02 before holding a hearing under this subsection. The court shall fix a time for the hearing and notice thereof must be given to the defendant and the prosecution at least five days prior thereto. The court shall permit the prosecution and counsel for the defendant, or the defendant if the defendant is not represented by counsel, to inspect the presentence report sufficiently before the hearing as to afford a reasonable opportunity for verification. In extraordinary cases, the court may withhold material not relevant to a proper sentence, diagnostic opinion that might seriously disrupt a program of rehabilitation, any source of information obtained on a promise of confidentiality, and material previously disclosed in open court. A court withholding all or part of a presentence report shall inform the parties of its action and place in the record the reasons therefor. The court may require parties inspecting all or part of a presentence report to give notice of any part thereof intended to be controverted. In connection with the hearing, the defendant is entitled to compulsory process and cross-examination of such witnesses as appear at the hearing. A duly authenticated copy of a former judgment or commitment is prima facie evidence of such former judgment or commitment. If the jury or the court finds, after hearing, one or more of the grounds set forth in subsection 1, that the defendant is a dangerous special offender or a habitual offender, the court shall sentence the defendant to imprisonment for an appropriate term within the limits specified in subsection 2.

      A conviction shown on direct or collateral review or at the hearing to be invalid or for which the offender has been pardoned on the ground of innocence must be disregarded for purposes of subdivision c. In support of findings under subdivision b, it may be shown that the offender has had control of income or property not explained as derived from a source other than criminal activity. For purposes of subdivision b, a substantial source of income means a source of income which for any period of one year or more exceeds the minimum wage, determined on the basis of a forty-hour week and a fifty-week year, without reference to exceptions, under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, for an employee engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, and which for the same period exceeds fifty percent of the offender’s declared adjusted gross income under chapter 57-38.

        Establishment of different categories of dangerous special offenders does not violate due process or equal protection requirements, and procedure provided to prosecutor does not amount to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. State v. Ternes, 259 N.W.2d 296, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 211</cite> (N.D. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 944, 98 S. Ct. 1524, 55 L. Ed. 2d 540, 1978 U.S. LEXIS 1280 (U.S. 1978).

        Terms “mentally abnormal” and “persistent aggressive behavior” are not unconstitutionally vague, nor is this section unconstitutional on basis of not providing ascertainable standards of guilt. State v. Wells, 265 N.W.2d 239, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 1978).

        This section did not constitute a special or local law in violation of former N.D. Const., Art. IV, § 43 (now repealed). State v. Jensen, 333 N.W.2d 686, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1983).

        This section was not unconstitutional as an ex post facto law when applied to a defendant who committed offenses before effective date of this section and who was tried and convicted after effective date. State v. Jensen, 333 N.W.2d 686, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1983).

       <p>
        As the defendant’s prosecution came within the exception of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-01-01(3)(b) and he had asked to be sentenced under the new criminal code, he had waived his argument that the dangerous special offender statute as applied to him operated as an unconstitutional ex post facto law. State v. Jensen, 429 N.W.2d 445, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied due process when trial judge knew of State’s intent to prosecute him as an habitual offender; this section is intended to keep such information from the jury, but contains no language prohibiting the trial judge from learning of State’s intent, and furthermore, the court specifically sentenced defendant without regard to whether he was an habitual offender. State v. Syvertson, 1999 ND 137, 597 N.W.2d 644, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 956, 120 S. Ct. 383, 145 L.

        Where state had informed defendant prior to his guilty plea that it intended to seek an extended sentence pursuant to this section based upon a belief that defendant was a dangerous, mentally abnormal person, and such extended sentence was granted by sentencing court but was remanded upon appeal due to state’s failure to set out with particularity in its notice to seek extended sentence its reasons for believing defendant a dangerous, mentally abnormal person, notice was not so defective as to violate constitutional due process requirement that defendant be given notice of potential sentence before pleading, and state was entitled to amend its notice upon remand to cure defect in original notice.

        This statute establishes four categories of special offenders (former subdivisions 1a to 1f; now see subdivisions 1a to 1e) who may be shown to be dangerous and one category of special offenders (former subdivision 1e covering those who used a firearm, dangerous weapon or destructive device; now see subdivision 1f) who are, per se, dangerous.

       <p>
        This section does not require dangerous special offender hearing and sentencing hearing to be two distinct and separate hearings and, therefore, combining hearings into one proceeding is not error. State v. Jensen, 333 N.W.2d 686, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, it is permissible for the trial court to combine the dangerous special offender hearing and the sentencing hearing into one proceeding. State v. Hoffarth, 456 N.W.2d 111, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court was informed by presentence report and by testimony given at change-of-plea hearing that defendant used a firearm in committing crimes, it was unnecessary for the trial court to require the prosecution to repeat that evidence at the dangerous special offender hearing. State v. Hoffarth, 456 N.W.2d 111, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 112</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        In a post-conviction relief case, an appellate court was unable to review findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard in N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) because the trial court did not mention the State’s alleged failure to comply with the requirements of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-09, and it failed to address the effectiveness of counsel relating to such.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section does not create a new crime but only provides for an increase in the penalty for offense of which defendant was convicted. State v. Wells, 265 N.W.2d 239, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Court’s previous decisions, it was clear that the only predicate fact necessary to enhance a penalty under subsection (1)(e) was that the defendant committed a crime using a firearm, dangerous weapon, or destructive device; therefore, where defendant conceded his use of a firearm to kill his wife’s lover, trial court’s failure to have the jury find the predicate fact that defendant used a firearm beyond a reasonable doubt to do so was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. Clark v. State, 2001 ND 9, 621 N.W.2d 576, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 15</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1043, 121 S. Ct. 2010, 149 L. Ed. 2d 1011, 2001 U.S. LEXIS 3934 (U.S. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only predicate fact upon which defendant’s sentence was enhanced under the special dangerous offender statute was that defendant used a dangerous weapon to kill the victim, a fact that was never in dispute; thus, the failure to retroactively apply the
   <i>
    Apprendi
   </i>
   doctrine to defendant’s case, if error, was harmless error and defendant’s application for post-conviction relief was properly denied. Greybull v. State, 2004 ND 116, 680 N.W.2d 254, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        Two things that are “equivalent” have more characteristics in common than two things that are “similar”; the difference is one of degree, and the resemblance need not be as strong for two offenses to be similar as for two offenses to be equivalent.

         Dangerous Special Offender Designation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Supreme court was not persuaded by plaintiff’s unsupported assertion that the trial court could not designate him as a dangerous special offender solely because his sentence could not be extended; if there was any error in doing so, it had no foreseeable legal effect. State v. Ash, 526 N.W.2d 473, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court abused its discretion by misapplying or misinterpreting the law when it sentenced defendant for conspiracy to commit kidnapping as a dangerous special offender because his previous child abuse offense was not a similar offense in terms of its elements or its underlying conduct; in the child abuse offense, defendant injured his infant son, but his conduct in the conspiracy to commit kidnapping offense did not cause physical injury to the victim’s baby. State v. Hoehn, 2019 ND 222, 932 N.W.2d 553, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Comparison of the statutory elements does not support a finding that a child abuse offense is similar to a kidnapping offense since the child abuse statute requires that a defendant inflict harm on the victim and cause some form of injury and also requires that the victim be a child; the kidnapping statute requires none of these elements but requires an abduction and an interference with a governmental or political function, and the child abuse statute requires neither of these. State v. Hoehn, 2019 ND 222, 932 N.W.2d 553, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the courts do when considering whether offenses are equivalent, to determine whether two offenses are similar, the courts examine both the elements of the two statutes and, if necessary, also the facts underlying each conviction; because similar assaultive conduct may for a variety of reasons result in charges for disorderly conduct, simple assault, aggravated assault, or attempted murder, a simple comparison of statutes may be insufficient to determine whether two offenses are similar. State v. Hoehn, 2019 ND 222, 932 N.W.2d 553, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 225</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the district court amended the judgment within 14 days of the State’s motion, any error in doing so was harmless because amending the judgment to correct count 2 to indicate defendant was sentenced as a dangerous special offender did not change the sentence and did not affect his substantial rights as the jury found he used a firearm and the court stated at the sentencing hearing that he was being sentenced as a dangerous special offender. State v. Yoney, 2020 ND 118, 943 N.W.2d 791, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        A separate finding of dangerous is required only when defendant is to be sentenced as a dangerous special offender by being a dangerous, mentally abnormal person under subdivision 1a; subdivisions 1b through 1d do not require a finding of dangerous, and under subdivision 1e dangerous element is per se implied upon a showing that defendant used a firearm.

        Trial court’s finding that defendant convicted of two counts of gross sexual imposition had previously been convicted of two felonies of Class C or above, at different times, when he was adult, supported the enhanced sentence of a total of 30 years in prison, and any error by the court in relying on the defendant’s pretrial psychiatric evaluation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Syvertson, 1999 ND 134, 597 N.W.2d 652, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 954, 120 S. Ct. 380, 145 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        It was no error to sentence defendant as an habitual offender because a prior felony, deemed a misdemeanor under former N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-02(9) when defendant was sentenced to less than one year in prison and probation, was deemed a felony when probation was revoked, which the court properly judicially noticed. Ratliff v. State, 2016 ND 129, 881 N.W.2d 233, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly dismissed defendant's application for postconviction relief because he did not establish that his trial counsel was ineffective where counsel could not be held responsible for something of which he had no knowledge, his chances of prevailing on a severance motion were slim where the codefendants did not testify against defendant, defendant's argument about the jury receiving an audio recording that was not received in evidence was determined in a previous proceeding, defendant did not identify what an objection to a jury instruction should have been or how it misstated the law, and the State only promised to forego the pursuit of habitual offender status if defendant entered into a written plea agreement. Ratliff v. State, 2016 ND 149, 882 N.W.2d 716, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion by sentencing defendant as an habitual offender because, although defendant argued that his prior out-of-state convictions were misdemeanors for the purpose of determining whether he was an habitual offender, defendant’s prior convictions had potential punishable sentences of at least five years, and were considered felonies under the habitual offender statute.

        In a notice alleging that defendant is especially dangerous because he used a firearm in commission of offense, it is not required that prosecutor set out with particularity reasons he believes defendant to be a dangerous special offender. State v. Ternes, 259 N.W.2d 296 (N.D. 1977), cert. denied, 435 U.S. 944, 98 S. Ct. 1524, 55 L. Ed. 2d 540 (1978), explained, State v. Wells, 265 N.W.2d 239, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly denied defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence because the sentence was not illegal where defendant had knowledge of the State's intent to seek the habitual offender sentence enhancement nine days before the hearing, but did not object to the enhancement at the hearing, and did not dispute that the previous convictions existed, or that they qualified for habitual offender status, defendant did not show that the sentence was in excess of the statutory parameters or that the convictions relied on by the State were not valid convictions and, by voluntarily pleading guilty, he waived any procedural defects in applying the enhancement for habitual offenders.

        Notice did not satisfy requirement of setting out with particularity reasons why state’s attorney believed defendant to be a dangerous special offender where only reasons given in notice were that defendant was over age of eighteen years when he committed offense of murder, that he was a dangerous, mentally abnormal person, and that he committed offense in a manner indicating lack of regard for value of human life. State v. Wells, 265 N.W.2d 239, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s enhanced sentence for endangering by fire or explosion was improper because the one-day notice given by the State of its intention to seek a habitual offender sentence enhancement under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-09(3) prejudiced both defendant and the trial court; the notice was not given at a reasonable time before trial.

        Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel by virtue of the fact that counsel did not inform him, prior to entry of his pleas or admissions, that defendants convicted of aggravated assault had to serve 85 percent of their sentences pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-09" target="_self">12.1-32-09</a></cite>.1 and that defendant was ineligible for placement at a particular facility.
   State v. Raulston, 2005 ND 212, 707 N.W.2d 464, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 267</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court improperly granted summary dismissal, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1), of a postconviction relief petitioner’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI, which claim was made on the ground that petitioner’s attorney did not inform petitioner that he would be required, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-9.1, to serve 85 percent of his sentence, because petitioner raised issues of fact and was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether counsel’s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and as to whether petitioner suffered prejudice therefrom.
   Sambursky v. State, 2006 ND 223, 723 N.W.2d 524, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in finding that the inmate’s trial counsel did not actively misinform him about the length of time he would serve in the state penitentiary under the plea agreement and that the evidence demonstrated that his trial counsel merely failed to inform the inmate of the 85 percent service requirement under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-09" target="_self">12.1-32-09</a></cite>.1, and therefore the inmate was not entitled to postconviction relief. Counsel freely admitted to not knowing about the 85 percent service requirement and not advising the inmate about the rule; the inmate conceded that counsel informed him that he was not subject to any mandatory minimum sentence and that North Dakota had no parolee rights; counsel denied ever telling the inmate that he would serve less time than what was agreed to in the plea agreements and that he could serve up to 30 years under the second plea agreement.
   Sambursky v. State, 2008 ND 133, 751 N.W.2d 247, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel as to sentencing failed, because the rule requiring service of 85% of his sentence did not apply to all Class B felonies, the application was not obvious and counsel did not actively misinform defendant. State v. Peterson, 2019 ND 140, 927 N.W.2d 74, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to correct his sentence because his sentence did not contain an arithmetical, technical, or other clear error to correct; while the statutes defining class B and C aggravated assault and requiring service of eighty-five percent of a sentence for specified offenses had been amended to remove the class C felony offense from the eighty-five percent service requirement, that did not constitute an "error" in sentence. State v. Myers, 2017 ND 265, 903 N.W.2d 520, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 266</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant’s sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole did not illegally postpone defendant’s parole eligibility beyond 85% of defendant’s life expectancy at the time of sentencing because N.D.C.C. §§ <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-09" target="_self">12.1-32-09</a></cite>.1 and 12.1-32-01(1), which were not ambiguous, could be harmonized by applying a floor of 30 years to serve, less any sentence reduction for good conduct, before defendant could be considered for parole, as defendant’s life expectancy at sentencing was less than 30 years, and the floor created by N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-01(1) insured an offender with a life expectancy less than 30 years was not eligible for parole until a minimum 30 year period had run. State v. Comes, 2019 ND 290, 936 N.W.2d 114, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 298</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court erred in computing defendant’s life expectancy because the use of the 2017 life expectancy table was contrary to the administrative rules. State v. Eggleston, 2020 ND 68, 940 N.W.2d 645, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        Although the trial court could inform a defendant who is pleading guilty about the requirements of this section, the court is not required under N.D.R.Crim.P. 11 to advise him about the implications of the statute, and the court’s failure to advise him about the statute did not affect the voluntariness of the plea. State v. Magnuson, 1997 ND 228, 571 N.W.2d 642, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 277</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court was correct in determining that appellant’s guilty pleas were voluntary and intelligent. Although a district court was encouraged to inform a defendant of the N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-32s12.1-32-09" target="_self">12.1-32-09</a></cite>.1 requirement to serve 85 percent of his sentence, the court was not required to do so.
   State v. Raulston, 2005 ND 212, 707 N.W.2d 464, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 267</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly granted summary dismissal, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 29-32.1-09(1), of a postconviction relief petitioner’s claim that his guilty plea was not knowingly and voluntarily made; although the district court did not inform petitioner that he would be required, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-9.1, to serve 85 percent of his sentence, the 85 percent rule was imposed as a condition of parole and was not a mandatory minimum sentence requiring disclosure under N.D.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(1)(Sambursky v. State, 2006 ND 223, 723 N.W.2d 524, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 2006).

        Defendant did not receive consecutive sentences for multiple misdemeanors exceeding one year since his class B probation sentence expired almost two months before his class A prison sentence commenced; consecutive is defined as “to follow in uninterrupted succession.” State v. Woehlhoff, 537 N.W.2d 543, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        Consecutive sentences of one year for a class A misdemeanor and thirty days for a class B misdemeanor is in excess of the one-year limitation provided in subsection (3), and is an abuse of discretion by the trial court.

       <p>
        Since driving while under the influence and driving with a suspended license each involve a substantially different criminal objective as a matter of law, the trial court was authorized to impose consecutive sentences for the defendant’s convictions of these two class A misdemeanors. State v. Ulmer, 1999 ND 245, 603 N.W.2d 865, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        District court did not err by sentencing defendant to consecutive sentences for three of the misdemeanor convictions as each of defendant's three consecutively-sentenced offenses was committed as part of a different course of conduct because the three offenses involved different crimes committed against different victims on different dates as defendant collected sexual images of multiple victims and in multiple retail locations over a span of weeks.

       <p>
        District court properly concluded that the crimes of aggravated reckless driving and driving under the influence (DUI) involved different criminal objectives for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-11(3); the definition of “substantially different criminal objectives” announced in State v. Ulmer was controlling in the case and, applying that definition, the supreme court concluded that the crimes of DUI and aggravated reckless driving constituted substantially different criminal objectives where aggravated reckless driving required a separate act of inflicting “injury upon the person of another,” and defendant’s separate act of hitting two pedestrians, mutilating the leg of one of them, was more than merely reckless drunk driving.
   State v. Salveson, 2006 ND 169, 719 N.W.2d 747, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 2006).

       <p>
        Crimes of driving under the influence (DUI) and aggravated reckless driving constitute substantially different criminal objectives for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-11(3) as each offense involves separate and distinct violations of the law and separate criminal objectives the legislature sought to proscribe; to conclude otherwise would mean the separate act of inflicting injury upon pedestrians while driving recklessly is without consequence.

        North Dakota Supreme Court applied the appropriate legal standard when it found that this section’s registration requirement was not additional punishment for defendant’s original conviction because the requirement to register did not impose on defendant any affirmative disability or restraint, did not fit within any traditional notion of what was punishment, furthered a legitimate public interest of protecting communities from sexual predators, and was not excessive considering its important purpose.

        Jury could reasonably have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant willfully failed to register as a sex offender in violation of

        In a case involving a failure to register as a sex offender, a trial court did not commit an obvious error by failing to instruct a jury on the affirmative defense of mistake of law under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-05-09 because defendant did not offer any credible evidence to show that he took steps toward discovering if he had to register a change in employment. Instead, defendant relied on his self-selected belief that he did not need to register such change and that no one told him any differently.

        Trial court erred in quashing the criminal information against defendant for failing to register as a convicted sexual offender based on the trial court’s erroneous interpretation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(7) because defendant was required to register a change of employment address. The express language of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(7), which provides that if an individual “has a change in name, school, or address” that person must inform the law enforcement agency with whom he last registered of the “new name, school, residence address, or employment address,” unambiguously requires a registered sexual offender to inform law enforcement of a change in employment address.

        The fact that a court did not inform the defendant of his need to register as a sex offender did not relieve the defendant of his obligation to register under subsection 3(c) of this section. State v. Rubey, 2000 ND 119, 611 N.W.2d 888, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 2000).

       <p>
        Defendant’s argument that N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15 required registration within 3 days, which did not include weekends or holidays, was rejected because N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15 did not state that registration had to be made in 3 business days; even if it was 3 business days, defendant still failed to comply. Therefore, a trial court did not err in its interpretation of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15, and the jury was properly instructed.
   State v. Meador, 2010 ND 139, 785 N.W.2d 886, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2010).

        Defendant’s argument that N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15 did not require a sexual offender locate a new address within three days, but required an offender to register a new address within three days of obtaining a new residence, was rejected because the plain language of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15 required an offender to register within 3 days of a change of address. Therefore, a trial court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to dismiss.

        Construed together, N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15 and N.D.C.C. ch. 27-20 authorize that the disposition of a juvenile found delinquent under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d) requires registration as a sexual offender under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(2)(c) unless the court finds the requirements for deviation from registration are met. In assessing the requirements for deviation from registration under those provisions, a juvenile court may order the preparation of a report or evaluation for purposes of registration, may require production of the report or evaluation at a registration hearing, and may rely on the report or evaluation in making necessary findings on the requirements for registration or for a deviation from registration.

       <p>
        Plain language of N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(2)(c), allows a deviation from the requirement for registration as a sexual offender for first-time juvenile offenders who commit certain enumerated offenses but do not exhibit mental abnormality or predatory conduct in the commission of the offense; that language indicates that registration is ordinarily required for juveniles found delinquent under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-20-03(1)(d) but allows a court some discretion in limited circumstances to permit deviation from registration for first time offenders who do not exhibit mental abnormality or predatory conduct in the commission of the offense. N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(4) authorizes the court to order an offender to be evaluated by a qualified counselor, psychologist, or physician before sentencing, and an individual’s sentence may include a requirement for registration under N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(2).

        While N.D.C.C. § 27-20-24(3) generally provides the State’s attorney, upon request of the court, shall present the evidence in support of any allegations of the petition not admitted and otherwise conduct the proceedings on behalf of the State, regardless of which party may have the ultimate burden of production or persuasion for the requirements of registration, however, the statutory framework authorizes the juvenile court to order, to require production of, and to rely on court-ordered reports or evaluations and requires the juvenile court to make necessary findings about mental abnormality or predatory conduct ostensibly from information in those reports or evaluations.

        While the trial court erred in deciding whether defendant was statutorily required to register as a sex offender after defendant’s probation was revoked, it nevertheless correctly determined that defendant had to register as a sex offender, and, thus, that decision had to be upheld on appeal. The trial court found that it should apply N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(2)(b), a permissive registration statute that took into account a number of factors to decide whether such registration was required, although it should have applied N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-15(2)(a) making it mandatory for felony sex offenders to register, as defendant had pled guilty to the sex offense of possession of certain materials prohibited under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-27.2s12.1-27.2-04" target="_self">12.1-27.2-04</a></cite>.1, which was a Class C felony.

        Requiring written findings delineating the reasons for denying a change of name petition is consistent with legislation which has expanded civil rights retained by convicts. In re Mees, 465 N.W.2d 172, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Convict has no right under this section or the constitution to appear personally at a civil proceeding where he is permitted to appear through counsel or deposition; personal appearance in a civil case rests within the discretion of the trial court, taking into consideration the costs and inconvenience of transporting a prisoner, any potential danger or security risks involved, the substantiality of the matter involved, the need for an early determination of the matter, possibility of delaying until prisoner is released, probability of success on the merits, integrity of the correctional system, and the interest of the prisoner in presenting his testimony in person rather than by deposition. In Interest of H., 283 N.W.2d 202, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 298</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The holding of a divorce hearing without the convict-husband being personally present because of his imprisonment did not constitute an abuse of the trial court’s discretion or violate any of convict-husband’s civil rights where his ability to give testimony by deposition and to be represented by counsel was unimpaired by the trial court, and no convincing reasons for a personal appearance were brought forth.

        Contempt was not an available remedy for a burglary victim as he was not a party to the criminal prosecution and did not suffer an injury recognized by law as a result of the district court’s decision to terminate the accused’s probation; therefore, the victim did not have standing to challenge the district court’s order. The victim’s rights enunciated in N.D.C.C. ch. 12.1-34 did not give the victim standing under N.D.R.Crim.P. 35, the court’s inherent authority to correct fraud, or N.D.C.C. § 12.1-32-07(7) to contest the court’s order terminating the accused’s probation and dismissing the criminal action against him.

        District court’s findings in support of closing the courtroom for the victim’s testimony were not clearly erroneous because the district court assumed that the State’s interest was to allow the juvenile victim to testify without fear, to keep her identity private, and to shield her from coercion and intimidation, and there was no reasonable alternatives to closure; it was not clearly erroneous to infer that the overriding interest was the express purpose of the statute.

        District court erred in denying defendant’s motion to dismiss a jury verdict finding him guilty of corruption and solicitation of a minor because the district court committed structural error by closing the courtroom during the complaining witness’ testimony without conducting a hearing, making findings, or analyzing the appropriate constitutional and statutory factors, and considered only that the complaining witness was a minor.

Furthermore, the failure to provide a right, privilege, or notice to a child victim or witness under this chapter is not grounds for the defendant to seek to have the conviction or sentence set aside.

      A perpetrator assumes the risk of loss, injury, or death resulting from or arising out of a course of criminal conduct involving a crime, as defined in this chapter, engaged in by the perpetrator or an accomplice, as defined in section 12.1-03-01, and the crime victim is immune from and not liable for any damages as a result of acts or omissions of the victim if the victim used reasonable force as authorized in section 12.1-05-03 or <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t12.1c12.1-05s12.1-05-04" target="_self">12.1-05-04</a></cite>. However, the perpetrator’s assumption of risk does not eliminate the crime victim’s duty to protect against conditions upon the premises which the crime victim knows or has reason to know may create an unreasonable risk of harm or which may cause a foreseeable trespass by minors, nor does the assumption of risk apply to perpetrators who are mentally incompetent or deficient.

        Defendant failed to prove entrapment in connection with the crime of patronizing a minor for commercial sexual activity; the online advertisement and text messages from the undercover officer posing as a young girl merely afforded defendant an opportunity to commit a crime and did not shock the court’s conscience. State v. Rai, 2019 ND 71, 924 N.W.2d 410, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       <p>
        District court properly denied defendants' motions for judgment of acquittal and found them guilty of patronizing a minor for commercial sexual activity because they each discussed engaging in sex acts and paying for the sex acts with someone claiming to be a minor, they drove to the location discussed with the agreed upon payment on their person, the agreement could be made with someone other than a minor, and the statute did not require the presence of a minor. State v. Davison, 2017 ND 188, 900 N.W.2d 66, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly found guilty of patronizing a minor for commercial sexual activity because the stipulated facts indicated that defendant agreed to exchange money or something of value for a sex act, that defendant originally thought an undercover officer purporting to be a female with whom defendant communicated was over eighteen but later learned that the purported female claimed to be sixteen, and that defendant arrived at an agreed upon hotel and knocked on the designated room door. The actual presence of a minor was not required. State v. Sheperd, 2017 ND 260, 903 N.W.2d 292, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to allow a jury to draw a reasonable inference in favor of conviction and defendant’s motion for acquittal was properly denied; text message conversations supported the State’s argument that defendant believed he was talking to a 14-year old girl and intended to pay her for a sexual encounter, and testimony from officers involved in the operation also established the elements of the crime. State v. Rai, 2019 ND 71, 924 N.W.2d 410, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite> (N.D. 2019).
