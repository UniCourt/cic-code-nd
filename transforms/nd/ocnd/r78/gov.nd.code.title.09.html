        The contract in the case of a note secured by a mortgage included the agreement of the mortgagor to pay but did not include the procedure as to foreclosure in the event of default, so that a statutory change in the procedure for foreclosure did not impair the obligation of contract. First Nat'l Bank v. Paulson, 69 N.D. 512, 288 N.W. 465, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 1939).

       <p>
        District court did not err by finding that a contract existed for legal services between the special prosecutor and the State because all communications prior to the commencement of the representation were between the State and the prosecutor, the governor sent the prosecutor an appointment letter and work on the removal of the sheriff began at the direction of the governor, and upon conclusion of its services the prosecutor sent the invoice to the governor.

        There need not be a showing of damage to avoid a contract for fraud since the fraud prevents the consent of the parties from being free. Raymond v. Edelbrock, 15 N.D. 231, 107 N.W. 194, 1906 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 34</cite> (N.D. 1906).

        There was no consent, therefore no contract, where a party who could not read signed a written contract under an erroneous belief, induced by the other party, as to its contents. Mathias v.

        Where the vice president of the bank fraudulently induced a debtor to enter into a $250,000 loan by making false statements, the debtor neither received the loan proceeds nor received the promised collateral for the obligation. Because the debtor’s consent was not freely gvien for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 9-01-02, he was entitled to rescind the loan.

        District court properly granted a borrower summary judgment on a lender’s counterclaim for fraud in the inducement because the borrower did not have a fiduciary relationship with the lender; the borrower’s requirement that the lender enter into a lease agreement with a limited liability company as part of the ordinary underwriting process did not show a special circumstance giving rise to a fiduciary relationship between the borrower and the lender.

        Terms that completely described the type of business restriction, the duration of the restriction, and the geographic limitation of the restriction, left no doubt there were no other essential non-competition terms left for agreement between the parties, and objectively evidenced the parties’ mutual intent to create an enforceable non-competition agreement.

        District court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in an Indian Tribe’s action challenging the NCAA’s interference with a university’s use of a name, logo, and imagery relating to the Tribe because (1) the Tribe had not established a prima facie 42 U.S.C.S. § 1981 discrimination case as it failed to show that the NCAA acted with discriminatory intent; (2) the Tribe had not established a tortious interference with a contract claim as it failed to show the existence of a contract under N.D.C.C. § 9-01-02 or N.D.C.C. § 27-19-09 in that there was no indication of mutual intent to create a legal obligation, let alone an obligation sufficiently definite and certain that a court could require its performance; and (3) the NCAA’s acts neither violate the laws of the land nor plainly violate its own constitution and bylaws.

        Essential terms of an oral contract to continue lending money in the future include the amount and duration of the loans, interest rates, and, where appropriate, the methods of repayment and collateral for the loans, if any. Taken alone, the absence of any one of these terms may not be of great significance; however, viewed collectively, their absence is fatal to the existence of a binding contract. Delzer v. United Bank, 459 N.W.2d 752, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        On review of a summary judgment that had found an alleged oral contract to be barred by the statute of frauds, because the evidence had to be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, both consent and an oral agreement between the parties satisfying the requirements of this section had to be assumed for purposes of the appeal. Bloomquist v. Goose River Bank, 2013 ND 154, 836 N.W.2d 450, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 157</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Where a title company sought payment for title work done on an oil company’s behalf, it was not clearly erroneous to find that the parties entered into an implied contract, because (1) the title company kept the oil company informed on the progress of the work the title company was doing on the oil company’s behalf, (2) the oil company never notified the title company that it had not accepted the terms of the contract and never disputed the steady flow of invoices detailing the work the title company was doing, and (3) the oil company benefited from the title work.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in holding a premarital agreement unenforceable because the parties were unable to give property consent as required by statute in light of the unfamiliar and inflexible terms of the agreement as well as its rapid formation and execution where very little planning went into the creation of the agreement. The parties decided to sign a premarital agreement at the urging of the wife’s mother, the lawyer who drafted the agreement did not receive any information regarding the parties’ property until the morning of the wedding, the husband was not advised to seek independent legal advice and there was no time for him to do so, and in the span of less than five hours, the parties were pressed to execute the entire premarital agreement from scratch, go through a wedding ceremony with a justice of the peace, eat lunch, and get to the bank before it closed. While that hectic schedule did not itself invalidate the agreement’s enforceability, it was a strong indicator of the haphazard manner in which the agreement was put together.

        With respect to a promissory note executed jointly by a mother and son, a trial court did not err in allowing the son’s inheritance to be offset by the entire amount that the mother’s estate paid in satisfaction of the note because the son had received 100 percent of the benefit from the note, as the son had received title and legal interest in a tractor and land purchased with the borrowed money; the fact that the mother had been allowed to reside on the land purchased with the money was not a “benefit” to the mother arising under the note.

        A co-guarantor may purchase an assignment of a note and the guaranties, but the initial relationship as co-guarantors will operate as a matter of law to restrict the recovery and will govern the rights of the co-guarantors.

        One who executes a full, joint and several guarantee may not compel his co-guarantors to pay their pro rata shares to a creditor who has obtained a judgment against him and, instead, must first pay more than his pro rata portion of the judgment himself and then seek contribution.

        Joint obligor did not show that there was any material issue of fact regarding the collection agency’s attempt to collect from the joint obligor the contribution amount that the co-joint obligor had assigned to the collection agency. Pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 9-01-08, the collection agency was entitled to recover that amount because the co-joint obligor as a guarantor on the loans made to the corporations run by him and the joint obligor, another guarantor, had the right to recover the amount that the co-joint obligor could have recovered, and the joint obligor did not show that the joint obligor had any viable defense.

        District court erred in denying an assignee’s application for a charging order against a second guarantor because the assignee could statutorily take an assignment of a bank against two guarantors, the assignee could then take an assignment of the judgment from the first guarantor to enforce his right of contribution from the second guarantor for the “unsatisfied amount of the judgment,” and the second guarantor did not present any evidence contesting the amount of his proportional share of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment, and any execution sought against the second guarantor was only for his proportionate share.

        In a contract dispute regarding the construction of an oilseed processing plant and the supply of seed processing equipment, the project owner was an intended third-party beneficiary entitled to enforce the supplier’s express production guarantees in the contract between the general contractor and the supplier because, inter alia, the supplier promised that its equipment would meet production guarantees that the general contractor had warranted to the project owner.

        An agreement between a bank and another party, whereby the debt of a third party to the bank would be discharged on the delivery of certain notes to the bank, was in effect modified when the bank issued and the other party accepted a receipt showing that the notes were received as collateral, not in discharge of the debt, and the third party could not enforce the original agreement.

        In a breach of contract action arising from a storm sewer improvement project, a no damages for delay clause controlled the parties’
   contractual relationship and granted a third-party benefit to the city’s other contractors for delays caused by their neglect; therefore, under N.D.C.C. § 9-02-04, an engineering contractor was entitled to enforce that provision for delays caused by its neglect.

        Argument that because a certain provision inserted in contract by plaintiff was ambiguous, and because defendants’ understanding of the ambiguous language was different from that of plaintiff, there was no “meeting of the minds” necessary to formulate an agreement between the two parties, was without merit.

        Where the vice president of the bank fraudulently induced a debtor to enter into a $250,000 loan by making false statements, the debtor neither received the loan proceeds nor received the promised collateral for the obligation. Because the debtor’s consent was not freely given for purposes of N.D.C.C. § 9-03-01(1), he was entitled to rescind the loan.

        District court properly granted a borrower summary judgment on a lender’s counterclaim for fraud in the inducement because the borrower did not have a fiduciary relationship with the lender; the borrower’s requirement that the lender enter into a lease agreement with a limited liability company as part of the ordinary underwriting process did not show a special circumstance giving rise to a fiduciary relationship between the borrower and the lender.

        Where a title company sought payment for title work done on an oil company’s behalf, it was not clearly erroneous to find that the parties entered into an implied contract, because (1) the title company kept the oil company informed on the progress of the work the title company was doing on the oil company’s behalf, (2) the oil company never notified the title company that it had not accepted the terms of the contract and never disputed the steady flow of invoices detailing the work the title company was doing, and (3) the oil company benefited from the title work.

       District court properly granted a borrower summary judgment on a lender’s counterclaim for fraud in the inducement because the borrower did not have a fiduciary relationship with the lender; the borrower’s requirement that the lender enter into a lease agreement with a limited liability company as part of the ordinary underwriting process did not show a special circumstance giving rise to a fiduciary relationship between the borrower and the lender.

        Where a contractor sued a company for damages for payment of extra demolition work necessitated by the discovery of buried concrete at a construction site, summary judgment in favor of the contractor was appropriate on the claim of actual fraud as the evidence did not suggest that the company knew of the buried contract at the time of the contract in 1987, although it could be inferred from the evidence that the company knew of the buried contract in the 1970’s;
   however, summary judgment was inappropriate as to the claim for negligent misrepresentation under N.D.C.C. 9-03-08(2) as there were genuine issues of fact raised as to whether some of the concrete was discoverable and whether describing the project without including the buried concrete was warranted by the information available to the company.

         Distinction Between Fraud and Deceit.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A fraud action brought under this chapter applies only to misrepresentations between parties to a contract, while deceit under the provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 9-10, applies where there is no contract between the parties. Olson v. Fraase, 421 N.W.2d 820, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Technically, fraud under this section applies only when there is a contract between the parties; deceit under N.D.C.C. § 9-10-02 applies when there is no contract between the parties, nevertheless, conduct can be both fraudulent and deceitful. Dewey v. Lutz, 462 N.W.2d 435, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The only significant distinction between the torts of fraud and deceit is whether the wrongdoer happens to be a party to a contract. The conduct prohibited under the separate statutory definitions of fraud and deceit is substantially identical and for purposes of the punitive damages statute, fraud and deceit are synonymous. Dewey v. Lutz, 462 N.W.2d 435, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Where buyers purchased a property “as is” and contracted not to hold the seller liable for any non-disclosed or latent defects, and the buyers presented testimony of the seller’s alleged fraudulent statements regarding the profitability and condition of the property but presented no evidence showing the seller’s statements amounted to either fraud or deceit under N.D.C.C. §§ 9-03-08 or 9-10-02, the evidence presented at trial led to the conclusion that the seller’s statements did not rise to the level of fraud or deceit and the district court properly granted judgment as a matter of law. Statements of value and predictions of future earnings or profits fall within the class of statements whose truth or falsity cannot be precisely determined and which are not, therefore, actionable as misrepresentations of fact and statements of opinion, as, for example, expressions by the seller commending the thing he is selling, have been held not actionable even though they are false.

        Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the decedent’s second husband in a will contest because the decedent’s daughter failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact to support her claim of fraudulent misrepresentation under N.D.C.C. § 9-03-08, which alleged that her mother’s second “husband” induced the mother to marry him in order to inherit her estate even though he was not divorced from his first wife. While the lack of documentation of the husband’s divorce from his first wife may have raised an inference about the validity of the mother’s marriage, the lack of documentation was insufficient in itself to support either a reasonable inference that the husband engaged in fraudulent conduct or that the mother would not have devised to the husband the home the couple shared together for more than 20 years.

        In an averment of fraud, the circumstances constituting fraud must be stated in particularity. Miller Enters. v. Dog N' Cat Pet Ctrs., 447 N.W.2d 639, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 208</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        No particular form or language is required in alleging fraud, so long as the elements constituting fraud may be found from reading the whole pleading. However, when the plaintiff makes an allegation of fraud, the defendant must receive enough information to prepare a response and defense, and the plaintiff must apprise the defendant fairly of the charge. Miller Enters. v. Dog N' Cat Pet Ctrs., 447 N.W.2d 639, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 208</cite> (N.D. 1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proof of actual damage proximately caused by misrepresentation or nondisclosure is an essential element of a tort action for fraud and deceit, since courts cannot correct unconscientious acts which are followed by no loss or injury. Schneider v. Schaaf, 1999 ND 235, 603 N.W.2d 869, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 262</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Language of the siblings’
   petition, read as a whole, did not allege any facts with particularity which constituted fraud and the siblings were not entitled to claim fraud as a basis for voiding the personal representative’s deed; allegations of assumptions and understandings by a party to an agreement did not alone allege fraud by the other party to that agreement.

       </p>
       <p>
        “A promise made without any intention of performing it” if made with the intent to induce another party to enter into a contract is actual fraud. Lanz v. Naddy, 82 N.W.2d 809, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though fraud can be based upon a promise made without the intention to perform, under North Dakota law and the law generally, the burden is upon the party asserting fraud to establish the elements of fraud and among such elements is an intent to deceive. Hablas v. Armour &amp; Co., 270 F.2d 71, 1959 U.S. App. LEXIS 4737 (8th Cir. N.D. 1959).

       <p>
        Suppression of that which is true, by one having knowledge of fact and who is party to contract, with intent to deceive other party thereto or to induce him to enter into contract, constitutes “actual fraud”; inducement and reliance may be inferred from facts and attending circumstances of transaction although fraud must be proved by evidence that is clear, satisfactory and convincing.

        There can be fraud without the making of a positive false statement; suppression of a material fact, which a party is bound in good faith to disclose, is equivalent to a false representation. Diemert v. Johnson, 299 N.W.2d 546, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 304</cite> (N.D. 1980).

        In a foreclosure action, the bank’s assignee was properly granted summary judgment because the mortgagors’
   judgment creditor waived its right to the alleged surplus from the sheriff’s sale by subordinating its judgment in an agreement with the bank, the creditor failed to prove that it was fraudulently induced into entering the agreement, the creditor’s constructive fraud claim failed because no qualifying duty existed between the bank and the creditor, and the bank’s agreement not to make a claim for reimbursement against the creditor for the sheriff’s fees and commissions constituted valid consideration for the agreement because a bona fide controversy existed regarding the fees and commissions.

        Dismissal of a grantor’s complaint seeking reformation of a deed was appropriate because a reservation in the deed expressly providing the grantor with the right to hunt on any or all the premises was a severance of hunting rights from the surface rights that was prohibited by statute. Furthermore, the complaint clearly alleged a mistake of law in the context of ignorance of the law, not a misapprehension of the law, for which the remedy of reformation was not available as a matter of law.

        Where lessees’ failure to ascertain the true state of the title to property was the basis for their alleged mistake of fact, that mistake could not void the lease agreement, because they could have determined the true state of the title to the land in question before entering into the lease by checking the office of the register of deeds [now recorder].

        Where plaintiff signed release mistakenly believing that he was releasing only his claim for damage to his car and was unaware of his possible claim for loss of consortium, plaintiff’s misunderstanding was not a mistake of fact or law as defined by statute and consequently mistake was not a ground for rescission under N.D.C.C. § 9-09-02(1).

        Plaintiff’s misunderstanding of the effect of the release he signed was not a mistake of fact under this section merely because he was aware of the facts as they really were. Rather, plaintiff’s erroneous belief that the release did not discharge his claim of loss of consortium resulted from his ignorance that under the facts he had such a claim. Lange v.

        “Purchase Agreement” and “Amendment to the Purchase Agreement” the sellers received was an offer from the buyer to purchase the property; although the sellers signed the agreement, the district court found the sellers made substantive changes and additions to the agreement and the parties did not agree upon the essential terms. The sellers made substantive changes to the agreement before signing it and their acceptance was not unqualified; the evidence supported the finding that the parties did not agree to the essential terms of the agreement and the sellers’
   modifications to the agreement constituted a counteroffer.

        District court properly granted a lessee summary judgment and dismissed an assignee's claims that an oil and gas lease terminated due the land manager's letter because the letter did not constitute a written contract required to modify the lease since it did not contain the elements for a valid contract; the letter did not establish a written agreement to modify the lessee's rights, and the lessors did not sign or otherwise communicate acceptance of the purported offer.

        “Purchase Agreement” and “Amendment to the Purchase Agreement” the sellers received was an offer from the buyer to purchase the property; although the sellers signed the agreement, the district court found the sellers made substantive changes and additions to the agreement and the parties did not agree upon the essential terms. The sellers made substantive changes to the agreement before signing it and their acceptance was not unqualified; the evidence supported the finding that the parties did not agree to the essential terms of the agreement and the sellers’
   modifications to the agreement constituted a counteroffer.

        Proposal Not Revoked.

      </p>
      <p>
       Court did not err in finding that the offer by a subcontractor to contractor to supply aggregate was not revoked due to the lapse of a reasonable time between the offer and acceptance under N.D.C.C. § 9-03-23(2) where the contractor told the subcontractor in May of 2002 that he had the low bid and that he intended to use the subcontractor’s bid in calculating the contractor’s bid for the project and, although there was evidence in the record about industry standards of a five to ten day acceptance period for a subcontractor’s quote, there was also evidence in the record that industry standards established a contract between a prime contractor and a subcontractor if the subcontractor knew the prime contractor was relying on the subcontractor’s quote and the prime contractor was awarded the contract based upon that quote. There was evidence in the record which supported the creation of an oral contract between the parties in May 2002, when the contractor relied on the subcontractor’s quote and in June 2002, when the subcontractor agreed to do the job and the contract did not fail because of lack of timely acceptance.

        This section was inapplicable where plaintiffs did not voluntarily accept money as a benefit of lease agreement but accepted it as a benefit of trial court’s judgment. Bangen v. Bartelson, 553 N.W.2d 754, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 216</cite> (N.D. 1996).

       <p>
        Where a title company sought payment for title work done on an oil company’s behalf, it was not clearly erroneous to find that the parties entered into an implied contract, because (1) the title company kept the oil company informed on the progress of the work the title company was doing on the oil company’s behalf, (2) the oil company never notified the title company that it had not accepted the terms of the contract and never disputed the steady flow of invoices detailing the work the title company was doing, and (3) the oil company benefited from the title work.

        Defendant was not bound to an area of mutual interest agreement (AMI) under North Dakota law because it voluntarily accepted the benefits of a transaction, as plaintiffs could not point to any evidence of conduct on the part of defendant that was inconsistent with its interpretation of the assignment — namely, that it refused to accept assignment of the AMI agreement in its dealings with another defendant. Spring Creek Exploration &amp; Prod. Co., LLC v. Hess Bakken Invs. II, LLC, 882 F.3d 1176, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 4096 (10th Cir. Colo. 2018).

        Court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that this statute bound defendant to an area of mutual interest (AMI) agreement because the defendant voluntarily accepted the benefits of a broader agreement; two arguments were unavailing because they were unmoored from any benefits that would relate to being a party to the AMI Agreement, as opposed to other portions of the multifaceted broader agreement.

        In a breach of contract case, there was no error in failing to dismiss a corporation as a party to the action, even though there was no pre-incorporation contract, because the corporation had knowledge of all of the material facts surrounding a transaction where a contractor was the principal shareholder and registered agent of the corporation, and he testified that the corporation received payments under the contract and that the project at issue became the corporation’s at some point. The evidence did not support a finding that a pre-incorporation contract existed based on the date that the corporation came into existence.

        Ambiguity existed as to whether an assignment of an interest in oil and gas leases and lands included an area of mutual interest clause in a letter agreement, and the recording of the letter agreement did not conclusively establish that an assignee had voluntarily accepted the benefit of the transaction; thus, summary judgment finding that the assignment included the clause was improper.

       </h5>
       <p>
        If consideration exists, courts will generally not inquire into the adequacy of the consideration. However, it is important to distinguish the adequacy of consideration from its existence. When no consideration is present a valid contract is not formed and this is a legal issue which may be determined by a court. Harrington v. Harrington, 365 N.W.2d 552, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Uncertainty of the landowners ever receiving a one-sixth production royalty did not, as a matter of law, prevent that royalty from being enough consideration to avoid a total failure of consideration; both executed and executory consideration could support a contract, and the district court erred by concluding that the production royalty failed as a matter of law to support the leases.
   Ir. Oil &amp; Gas, Inc. v. Riemer, 2011 ND 22, 794 N.W.2d 715, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 2011).

       <p>
        Plaintiff’s teaching contract with defendant school district was altered when the school district granted her unpaid leave to allow her to travel to Greece. The alteration of her teaching contract was supported by new consideration under N.D.C.C. § 9-05-01, because plaintiff received the benefit of having several months notice of being able to travel to Greece without being in breach of the teaching contract; and the district received the benefit of knowing it would not have to pay plaintiff for the days she was in Greece.

        District court did not err in concluding that a stock purchase agreement was supported by adequate consideration where the written agreement was presumptive evidence of consideration, and the brother’s shares were restricted by a right of first refusal at the lower of book value or the price offered by a third party. Molbert v. Kornkven, 2018 ND 120, 910 N.W.2d 888, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 2018).

        Where each party to an agreement gave up the right to litigate resolution of their title dispute, where one party released all prior leases, paid a bonus, and promised that a well would be drilled, and the other party gave the first party a right to drill, the mutual benefits acquired and detriment borne by the parties constituted consideration.

        The lack of consideration invalidates a contract when the contract is illusory. An illusory contract may be defined as an expression cloaked in promissory terms, but which, upon closer examination, reveals that the promisor has not committed himself in any manner. In other words, an illusory promise is a promise that is not a promise. The promise is an illusion. Harrington v. Harrington, 365 N.W.2d 552, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        District court properly granted a lessee summary judgment and dismissed an assignee's claims that an oil and gas lease terminated due the land manager's letter because the letter did not constitute a written contract required to modify the lease since it did not contain the elements for a valid contract; the letter did not establish a written agreement to modify the lessee's rights, and the lessors did not sign or otherwise communicate acceptance of the purported offer.

        The consideration for a promise may be found in some prejudice either suffered or agreed to be suffered by the promisee, other than such as he at the time is lawfully bound to suffer.

        Detriment, as used in a contractual context, means legal detriment as distinguished, from detriment in fact. It means giving up something which the promisee was privileged to retain, or doing or refraining from doing something which he was privileged not to do, or not to refrain from doing. Harrington v.

        Valid consideration supported an option contract where the option stated that it was granted in consideration of the buyer’s previous purchase of real estate; moreover, even though it was argued that the consideration was past consideration, the only evidence that the land purchase was not in consideration of the option contract was controverted. The option provided ample consideration because a right given in the option contract was not given as consideration in the prior land purchase. Guthmiller Farms, LLP v.

        Valid consideration supported an option contract where the option stated that it was granted in consideration of the buyer’s previous purchase of real estate; moreover, even though it was argued that the consideration was past consideration, the only evidence that the land purchase was not in consideration of the option contract was controverted. The option provided ample consideration because a right given in the option contract was not given as consideration in the prior land purchase. Guthmiller Farms, LLP v.

        Because statutes allow the parties to a written instrument to challenge the existence of consideration, and there is no common law where the law is declared by the code, the owner was not estopped from asserting the option was gratuitous and given without consideration. Deckert v. McCormick, 2014 ND 231, 857 N.W.2d 355, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        In an action involving a chattel mortgage no independent proof of its consideration was necessary until it was attacked by the defendant by evidence which would overcome the statutory presumption.

        Valid consideration supported an option contract where the option stated that it was granted in consideration of the buyer’s previous purchase of real estate; moreover, even though it was argued that the consideration was past consideration, the only evidence that the land purchase was not in consideration of the option contract was controverted. The option provided ample consideration because a right given in the option contract was not given as consideration in the prior land purchase. Guthmiller Farms, LLP v. Guthmiller, 2013 ND 248, 840 N.W.2d 636, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 255</cite> (N.D. 2013).

        Where a title company sought payment for title work done on an oil company’s behalf, it was not clearly erroneous to find that the parties entered into an implied contract, because (1) the title company kept the oil company informed on the progress of the work the title company was doing on the oil company’s behalf, (2) the oil company never notified the title company that it had not accepted the terms of the contract and never disputed the steady flow of invoices detailing the work the title company was doing, and (3) the oil company benefited from the title work.

A contract implied in law, or quasi-contract, is not a contract at all but rather an obligation imposed by law to do justice even though it is clear that no promise was ever made or intended. The essence of an implied-in-law contract is the receipt of a benefit by a person from the claimant, which it would be inequitable for the person to retain without payment therefor. Johnson v.

        Whenever services are rendered by one family member to another, a presumption arises that the services are gratuitous and that compensation was not intended. However, the presumption does not apply to cases relying on implied-in-law contracts, nor does it apply to nonfamily members unless the parties, although never married, lived together as husband and wife.

        District court did not clearly err when it found that there was no implied-in-fact contract between a son and his parents because the evidence supported its determination that any services the son performed over the more than twenty year time span were rendered gratuitously, and the son failed to present evidence to rebut the presumption that his services were gratuitous.

       <p>
        If it would be inequitable for a person to retain the benefit, he is said to be unjustly enriched. A person who is unjustly enriched at the expense of another is required to make restitution to the other. Johnson v. Estate of Zent (In re Estate of Zent), 459 N.W.2d 795, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1990), reprinted, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. July 31, 1990).

       <p>
        In a contract dispute, there was no implied in law contract under N.D.C.C. § 9-06-01 to prevent unjust enrichment because a buyer and a seller had either an express or implied agreement that there was no reimbursement of expenses between the parties in relation to their attempt to merge their businesses. There could have been no implied in law contract to prevent unjust enrichment when there was an express or implied in fact contract between the parties relating to the same subject matter.

        Where plaintiff company had an agreement with another company to help it complete concrete work on a construction site and defendant company alleged that a “work order” contained language creating a flat rate price as opposed to the time-and-materials price sought by the plaintiff,
   the writing did not constitute the contract between the parties because it did not include both parties and all the essential or material terms and conditions of the agreement.
   Even though the contract between the parties was not a contract required to be in writing
   under the statute of frauds, the writing alleged to be the contract nevertheless had to meet all the requirements of a written contract under the statute of frauds, i.e., (1) who the contracting parties are, (2) the identity of the subject matter involved, (3) the consideration and (4) the terms and conditions upon which the contract was entered into.
   Therefore, the document was considered merely extrinsic evidence that the district court could consider when deciding what the terms of the oral contract were.

        Where plaintiff company had an agreement with another company to help it complete concrete work on a construction site and defendant company alleged that a “work order” contained language creating a flat rate price as opposed to the time-and-materials price sought by the plaintiff,
   the writing did not constitute the contract between the parties because it did not include both parties and all the essential or material terms and conditions of the agreement.
   Even though the contract between the parties was not a contract required to be in writing
   under the statute of frauds, the writing alleged to be the contract nevertheless had to meet all the requirements of a written contract under the statute of frauds, i.e., (1) who the contracting parties are, (2) the identity of the subject matter involved, (3) the consideration and (4) the terms and conditions upon which the contract was entered into.
   Therefore, the document was considered merely extrinsic evidence that the district court could consider when deciding what the terms of the oral contract were.

        Where plaintiff and his family operated a farm and ranch on defendants’ land for a number of years, making regular semi-annual payments to the landowners and making various improvements to the ranch during their occupancy, there was insufficient evidence to support plaintiff’s allegation of partial performance of an oral contract with the landowners giving the plaintiffs a lease option to buy out the principal balance at zero percent interest.
   The semi-annual payments and possession by the plaintiffs was consistent with a contract for deed and a lease, with or without an option to purchase and the various improvements, while numerous, were not consistent only with the alleged oral contract as they were made in conjunction with the plaintiffs’ farming and ranching operation and were consistent with a lease without an option to purchase.
   Thus, the alleged oral contract was not removed from the statute of frauds because there was not partial performance consistent only with the existence of the alleged contract. Fladeland v. Gudbranson, 2004 ND 118, 681 N.W.2d 431, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 2004).

        Essential terms of an oral contract to continue lending money in the future include the amount and duration of the loans, interest rates, and, where appropriate, the methods of repayment and collateral for the loans, if any. Taken alone, the absence of any one of these terms may not be of great significance; however, viewed collectively, their absence is fatal to the existence of a binding contract. Delzer v.

        An agreement to accept or purchase oil, gas, and mineral leases or assignments thereof is required to be in writing signed by the party to be charged whether such party be the assignor or the assignee; and if such agreements are executed by an agent his authority must be in writing subscribed by the party sought to be charged.

       <p>
        Alleged settlement agreement between an owner and a limited liability company (LLC) and its member was invalid under the statute of frauds because the owner failed to identify any evidence in the record of a signed writing authorizing the attorney for the LLC and member to execute the agreement; under subsection {3}, the LLC and member needed to sign a writing granting authority to the attorney to execute the agreement on their behalf.

        The evidence was sufficient to establish part performance of an oral contract to sell real estate so as to remove it from the statute of frauds where the purchasers under the alleged oral contract constructed permanent grain bins on the property, summer-fallowed the land, improved drainage ditches, possessed and farmed the land, paid property taxes on the land and were not charged rent for their occupancy.

        Where the evidence established that the senior mortgagee was eager for the mortgagor to find outside sources of capital, the junior mortgagees had a title opinion done on the land, and when that opinion did not disclose any prior mortgages, they loaned the mortgagor $90,000 which went to reduce its indebtedness to the senior mortgagee, the junior mortgages would not have loaned the money had they not received a first mortgage, and the junior mortgagees fully performed their part of the agreement by lending a total of $90,000; these facts constituted sufficient part performance consistent only with the oral subordination agreement to remove it from the operation of the statute of frauds.

        The general rule is that contracts for the sale of real property and transfers of real property interests must be made by an instrument in writing.

        Trial court did not err in granting possession of land to the personal representative of a mother’s estate because a son failed to prove that he had an oral contract for deed to buy the land from his parents; the son failed to clearly and definitely prove payments made by him were for the purchase of the real estate and he failed to prove by clear and definite evidence the existence of an oral contract for the sale of land which possessed all the necessary elements and features of an enforceable agreement. Although the trial court’s findings about the existence of an oral agreement considered criteria relevant to the statute of frauds, N.D.C.C. § 9-06-04(3), and specific performance in the context of finding there was no contract for the sale of land, the trial court’s findings reflected a correct application of the burden of proof under N.D.C.C. § 47-10-01 for claims for specific performance of an alleged oral contract to convey land.

Under the former, the “party to be charged” may be either the vendor or the vendee or their agents, while the latter requires a transfer by the vendor to be in writing. Petroleum Exch. v.

        The term “party to be charged” as used in subdivision 4 of this section clearly includes both vendor and vendee. Petroleum Exch. v. Poynter, 64 N.W.2d 718, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1954).

        An oral contract which is capable of performance within a year is valid, although its performance was not actually completed within that time. Sarles v. Sharlow, 37 N.W. 748, 5 Dakota 100, 1888 Dakota LEXIS 12 (Dakota 1888).

        A contract which may be performed within a year is not required to be in writing. Bergh v. John Wyman Farm Land &amp; Loan Co., 30 N.D. 158, 152 N.W. 281, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 114</cite> (N.D. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there is any possibility that an oral contract is capable of being completed within one year, the contract is not within the statute of frauds even though it is clear that the parties may have intended and thought probable that the contract would extend over a longer period, and even though the contract does so extend; contract must be impossible of performance within one year if it is to be proscribed by the statute of frauds. Bergquist-Walker Real Estate v. William Clairmont, Inc., 333 N.W.2d 414, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since there was a possibility, however remote, that asserted oral agreement was capable of being completed within one year, the agreement would not fall within the statute of frauds and, consequently, would not be proscribed by the provisions of N.D.C.C. § 9-06-04(1).

       <p>
        Since it did not appear from the pleadings that the prospective lessee could allege a claim that entitled him to relief regarding his alleged three-year oral lease of trucks from the prospective truck lessor, the trial court granted the prospective truck lessor’s motion for judgment on the pleadings; the three-year oral lease violated the statute of frauds, and neither the doctrines of promissory estoppel nor equitable estoppel applied to defeat the prospective truck lessor’s statute of frauds defense. Karch v. Equilon Enters., L.L.C., 286 F. Supp. 2d 1075, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18175 (D.N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Part performance exception to the statute of frauds did not apply because an owner did not cite any authority that had applied the part performance of an oral sale of real property to any actions outside of the three major categories or provided any reason to expand the doctrine; the owner had not demonstrated that the act of emailing the district court to request the pending trial be removed from the calendar was consistent only with the existence of the alleged oral contract.

        Statute of frauds should not be allowed to be used to promote an injustice; defendant was not allowed to invoke the statute of frauds as a defense to an action on his oral guarantee to make repayments of a loan made by plaintiff to a corporation where defendant induced plaintiff to make the loan to a corporation of which defendant was an incorporator and a stockholder, gave several assurances to plaintiff that loan would be repaid, was in position of trust with plaintiff at time when she was in an emotionally weakned state, induced the plaintiff to make the loan under false pretenses that he was financially unable to make the loan himself, avoided plaintiff’s request to have the terms of the loan reduced to writing, and received a direct personal benefit as a result of the loan in the form of a reimbursement from the corporation on a loan that he had previously made to the corporation, since to allow defendant to invoke the statute of frauds under such facts would promote an injustice.

        Where the vendee of an oral contract for the sale of real estate seeks to avoid the impact of the statute of frauds by showing partial performance, he must establish a contract that possesses all the elements and features necessary to the specific enforcement of any agreement, except the written memorandum required by the statute.

        The payment of money consideration by the buyer generally is not sufficient justification for enforcing an oral contract to convey land unless followed by other acts such as possession or the making of valuable improvements.

        Where defendant cotenants allege that an oral agreement for the sale to them by another cotenant of that cotenant’s interest in the common property has been removed from the statute of frauds by their partial performance, the acts alleged as partial performance must not be consistent with the continuance of the seller-cotenant’s interest. Parceluk v. Knudtson, 139 N.W.2d 864, 1966 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 202</cite> (N.D. 1966).

        Actions of purchaser did not constitute sufficient part performance to remove an oral contract for the sale of real property from the statute of frauds and entitle purchaser to specific performance where there was a dispute as to the amount of property to be sold and the actions were consistent with either disputed amount. Anderson v. Mooney, 279 N.W.2d 423, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 1979).

        Property owners failed to raise an issue of material fact that part performance removed an alleged agreement with the city from the statute of frauds because the affidavit and testimony of one of the owners provided nothing more than conclusory allegations of part performance; the owner’s testimony went no further than to allege she spent eight years cleaning the city’s streets so she could use them as pasture land.

        A real estate broker with whom lands are listed for sale by the owner has no authority to make a contract for the sale thereof which will bind the owner, in the absence of written authority signed by the owner authorizing him to do so. Ballou v. Bergvendsen, 9 N.D. 285, 83 N.W. 10, 1900 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 1900).

       </p>
       <p>
        The ordinary authority of a real estate broker with whom lands are listed for sale does not extend to the contract of sale. The authority to execute such contract is an additional authority which must be expressly given in writing. Queen City Lumber Co. v. Fisher, 111 N.W.2d 714, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        An agreement for sale of real property, if made by an agent of the party sought to be charged, is invalid unless the authority of the agent is in writing and subscribed by the party to be charged.

       <p>
        Where contract entered into by the purchaser and the real estate broker specifically provides that it is understood and agreed that the sale is made subject to approval in writing by the owner, it is immaterial whether the broker had the actual authority to make such contract in behalf of the owner, as approval of owner is necessary before a valid contract is made. Queen City Lumber Co. v. Fisher, 111 N.W.2d 714, 1961 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1961).

       <p>
        Rule that land sale contract entered into with purchaser by agent who had only verbal authority from owner was applicable even though agent was attorney; mere payment of money consideration by buyer is not sufficient justification for enforcing oral contract to convey land; acts relied upon as partial performance, to take an oral agreement out of statute of frauds, must be such as to be incomprehensible unless related to contract; payment of taxes, partial payment of $3,000 mortgage and possession of premises by purchaser were consistent with operation of land under his seven-eighths ownership of property and were insufficient to take alleged oral contract for sale of remaining one-eighth interest out of statute of frauds.

        Letter from automobile dealer offering salary of one hundred dollars per month and use of a new car yearly for five years in exchange for recipient’s acceptance of employment as good will representative was sufficient memorandum to take oral contract out of subsection 1 despite that the terms of the letter were sufficiently ambiguous to require admission of parol testimony.

        This section does not bar introduction of parol evidence for the purpose of proving that a contracting party was acting as agent of another when the purpose of the evidence is to establish the liability of the nonsigning principal, but it does bar admission of such evidence for the purpose of exculpating principal signatories to the written instrument.

        This rule can have no application until a written contract or agreement is established. Foot Schulze &amp; Co. v. Skeffington, 52 N.D. 307, 202 N.W. 642, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        A written contract supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral agreements or conditions concerning the subject matter of the contract, even though the contract is not required to be in writing. Jensen v. Siegfried, 66 N.D. 222, 263 N.W. 715, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 191</cite> (N.D. 1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, execution of written contract, whether law required it to be written or not, supersedes all preceding or accompanying oral negotiations or stipulations concerning subject matter of contract. Rieger v. Rieger, 175 N.W.2d 563, 1970 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite> (N.D. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parol evidence is inadmissible to vary or contradict the terms of a written contract between the parties to the contract; however, if an ambiguity exists in the contract, parol evidence is admissible to explain existing essential terms or to show the parties’ intent. Bye v. Elvick, 336 N.W.2d 106, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 309</cite> (N.D. 1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since nothing in written quit claim deeds suggested that the deeds were given as security for a loan to property owner, but rather the deeds unambiguously conveyed the owner’s interest in the land and no allegations of fraud, mistake, or accident were made, parol evidence was not admissible to contradict the grants in those quit claim deeds. Des Lacs Valley Land Corp. v. Herzig, 2001 ND 17, 621 N.W.2d 860, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the quitclaim deeds were unambiguous, the parol evidence rule precluded the consideration of extrinsic evidence, including that of mistake. Syversen v. Hess, 2003 ND 118, 665 N.W.2d 23, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 129</cite> (N.D. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the individuals claimed title through a series of quitclaim deeds, the judgment quieting title in the owner was affirmed because (1) the evidence supported the district court’s finding that the deed was conditional, and (2) this section could only have been applied to a deed with the conditions attached. Valley Honey Co., LLC v. Graves, 2003 ND 125, 666 N.W.2d 453, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1165, 124 S. Ct. 1179, 157 L.

   claim for reformation of a deed because there was parol evidence supporting the inference that a mistake was made; the deed was signed when the flowage easement had not yet been recorded, a mistake the grantee knew about, and there was also evidence that the grantee had told his real estate agent not to say anything about the flowage easement during the closing.

        District court
   erred in granting summary judgment to a mineral lessee because applying
   the parol evidence rule to prohibit consideration of the lessee's
   alleged fraudulent conduct would allow it to perpetrate fraud and
   injustice where genuine issues of material fact remained as to whether
   the lessee made the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations and whether
   the mineral owners were thereby induced to enter into the leases with

The intention of the parties in this regard therefore became a jury question. Berry v. Heinz, 139 N.W.2d 145, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 1965).

        Debtor’s bankruptcy estate was not entitled to the liquidation proceeds of a cash-value life insurance policy that debtor purchased for an employee, as the plain language of a split-dollar/collateral-assignment agreement limited debtor’s rights. By specifically providing for rights only in the event of a surrender by the employee and not for a surrender generally or for some other type of triggering event, the most natural reading of the contract clause (applying North Dakota rules of statutory construction) made an act of surrender by the employee a necessary trigger for the debtor to realize the right assigned in that clause.

        Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law. A contract is ambiguous when rational arguments can be made for different positions about its meaning. On appeal, the Supreme Court will independently review the contract to determine whether it is ambiguous. National Bank v. International Harvester Co., 421 N.W.2d 799, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        In a teacher contract dispute, the “teacher shall” language in a grievance policy did not prohibit a teacher association from utilizing the grievance procedures set forth in an agreement when the grievance effected the terms and conditions of a majority of the teachers and concerned the interpretation of the agreement; a restrictive reading would have effectively ignored the purpose for the agreement as set forth by the parties. Moreover, nothing in the agreement prohibited the association from bringing a legal action after a grievance had been denied or negotiations had failed. Williston Educ. Ass'n v. Williston Pub. Sch.

        In a dispute over a trust agreement, because the introductory language of one article and the general intent of the trust agreement showed that a husband and wife were to be the primary beneficiaries of the trust, an inconsistent provision regarding other potential beneficiaries was rejected as inconsistent under

Therefore, a motion for summary judgment was properly granted for the husband, who was acting as a trustee and a personal representative for the wife after her death, when he transferred property to himself and revoked the trust; moreover, a motion to reconsider filed by the potential beneficiaries was denied.

        In a dispute involving bridge donation, even if an agreement created a franchise, it was still a contract subject to the general statutory rules of contract interpretation, and the numerous obligations imposed on a company throughout the agreement were not eliminated; requiring the cities to perform by exercising an option before a 25-year term that the company was given to perform its obligations expired was an illogical and unreasonable interpretation of the agreement. A finding that the bridge was closed for 239 days because of flooding was not clearly erroneous, and an “Acts of God” provision operated to extend the terms of the agreement to February 5, 2014.

        Parol evidence cannot vary or contradict the terms of a complete, written contract adopted as a definite expression of the parties’ agreement. A court may look to parol evidence of intent when the written contract is ambiguous, or when it does not reflect the parties’ intent because of fraud, mistake or accident. Jorgensen v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The parol evidence rule presupposes that the written contract incorporates the entire subject matter of the prior negotiations and the rule does not preclude the possibility that a contract is partly oral and partly written.

        Parol evidence was properly considered under N.D.C.C. § 9-07-12 to determine the parties’

There was evidence that the parties did not intend for the contract to be a complete and final statement of all terms and that they had discussed changes in the dimensions of the laundry room and basement; further, a settlement disposed of any claims the owners might have had.

        In a dispute over an agreement involving property management, contract between the parties explicitly provided a procedure for termination that was combined with an automatic renewal provision; thus, in interpreting the contract as a whole, the district court properly found that the termination agreements were breached.

        Debtor’s bankruptcy estate was not entitled to the liquidation proceeds of a cash-value life insurance policy that debtor purchased for an employee, as the plain language of a split-dollar/collateral-assignment agreement limited debtor’s rights. By specifically providing for rights only in the event of a surrender by the employee and not for a surrender generally or for some other type of triggering event, the most natural reading of the contract clause (applying North Dakota rules of statutory construction) made an act of surrender by the employee a necessary trigger for the debtor to realize the right assigned in that clause.

        District court did not err in denying a rural water district reformation of two leases on land because there was no mutual mistake in the drafting of leases; the parties engaged in a mutually negotiated, arms-length, commercial transaction, and the district court weighed the evidence, found the commercial lease contracts clear and unambiguous, and found the district did not meet its burden of clear and convincing evidence for reformation.

        District court properly granted summary judgment quieting title to certain mineral interests in the plaintiffs because the subject (1953) deed’s language was unambiguous and conveyed to the grantees the grantor’s future interest in the 50 percent mineral interests reserved by the original grantor since the deed’s exception only excepted the original grantor’s interest “as reserved by” the prior deed, held at the time of the 1953 deed, and construing the 1953 warranty deed as a whole, the grantor specifically excepted and reserved to himself an undivided 25 percent of the mineral interest, without reference to the potential contingent future interest in the original limited warranty deed.

        Where partners contended that in signing contract they relied on plaintiff’s representation that certain words had been changed as the partners had requested, and where one of the partners testified that he had signed the final contract knowing that it still contained some of the disputed language, and where plaintiff’s negotiator denied any oral agreement to alter the contract and any representation relating to such alteration, defendants failed to bear the burden of proof required to win reformation of the contract.

       <p>
        In a dispute involving bridge donation, even if an agreement created a franchise, it was still a contract subject to the general statutory rules of contract interpretation, and the numerous obligations imposed on a company throughout the agreement were not eliminated; requiring the cities to perform by exercising an option before a 25-year term that the company was given to perform its obligations expired was an illogical and unreasonable interpretation of the agreement. A finding that the bridge was closed for 239 days because of flooding was not clearly erroneous, and an “Acts of God” provision operated to extend the terms of the agreement to February 5, 2014.

        In a teacher contract dispute, the “teacher shall” language in a grievance policy did not prohibit a teacher association from utilizing the grievance procedures set forth in an agreement when the grievance effected the terms and conditions of a majority of the teachers and concerned the interpretation of the agreement; a restrictive reading would have effectively ignored the purpose for the agreement as set forth by the parties. Moreover, nothing in the agreement prohibited the association from bringing a legal action after a grievance had been denied or negotiations had failed. Williston Educ. Ass'n v. Williston Pub. Sch.

        Under North Dakota law, a court could construe a purchase agreement and assignment together in determining whether defendant conveyed a leasehold interest in property on which wells were located or a wellbore-only interest. As the documents were ambiguous, the court properly heard testimony regarding the parties’ intentions and expert testimony regarding custom and usage in the oil and gas industry and did not clearly err in finding that the assignment was intended as a wellbore-only assignment and thus, dismissing plaintiff’s quiet title claim.

        In a dispute over a trust agreement, because the introductory language of one article and the general intent of the trust agreement showed that a husband and wife were to be the primary beneficiaries of the trust, an inconsistent provision regarding other potential beneficiaries was rejected as inconsistent under
   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t09c9-07s9-07-18" target="_self">9-07-18</a></cite>. Therefore, a motion for summary judgment was properly granted for the husband, who was acting as a trustee and a personal representative for the wife after her death, when he transferred property to himself and revoked the trust; moreover, a motion to reconsider filed by the potential beneficiaries was denied.

   contract; the contract was found to be ambiguous as to whether the general contractor had to prevail on its claims against third parties in order to recover fees related to prosecuting those claims from the subcontractor, and under N.D.C.C. § 9-07-09 the ambiguity was interpreted against the contractor.

        In a dispute involving bridge donation, even if an agreement created a franchise, it was still a contract subject to the general statutory rules of contract interpretation, and the numerous obligations imposed on a company throughout the agreement were not eliminated; requiring the cities to perform by exercising an option before a 25-year term that the company was given to perform its obligations expired was an illogical and unreasonable interpretation of the agreement. A finding that the bridge was closed for 239 days because of flooding was not clearly erroneous, and an “Acts of God” provision operated to extend the terms of the agreement to February 5, 2014.

        Debtor’s bankruptcy estate was not entitled to the liquidation proceeds of a cash-value life insurance policy that debtor purchased for an employee, as the plain language of a split-dollar/collateral-assignment agreement limited debtor’s rights. By specifically providing for rights only in the event of a surrender by the employee and not for a surrender generally or for some other type of triggering event, the most natural reading of the contract clause (applying North Dakota rules of statutory construction) made an act of surrender by the employee a necessary trigger for the debtor to realize the right assigned in that clause.

        Because reasonable arguments could be made for the parties’ different positions on the intent of defendants’ individual signatures on standby agreement, the agreement was ambiguous on whether or not defendants individually guaranteed debt of corporation to plaintiff, which left a question of fact to be determined with extrinsic evidence at a trial.

        City, on accepting petition of developer for installation of water and sewer facilities in its addition, set up special improvement districts, planned the work and accepted bids on a unit price basis. Before the contract was made for performance of the work by the successful bidder, procedure was changed by agreement and developer, as a party to the contract, joined with city in a contract with the successful bidder, in which developer agreed to pay for that portion of the work required to serve its addition. The city agreed to pay for the oversize of the systems necessary to serve other areas. In an action by the contractor against the developer the contract was construable as a unit price contract since the developer assumed the obligation of the city for the cost of improvements to be made within its addition.

        Parol evidence was properly considered under N.D.C.C. § 9-07-12 to determine the parties’
   intent under N.D.C.C. § 9-07-03, rather than simply looking to the words of the contract under N.D.C.C. §§ 9-07-04 and 9-07-09, in a breach of contract suit alleging that a builder had failed to construct a home in accordance with the plans. There was evidence that the parties did not intend for the contract to be a complete and final statement of all terms and that they had discussed changes in the dimensions of the laundry room and basement; further, a settlement disposed of any claims the owners might have had.

        Trial court should not have determined that the option of the option holders set forth in an option agreement no longer existed in a case where the option holders sued the third property owners for a declaration that the option holders still had a right to buy the property in dispute. Reading the agreement as a whole, as N.D.C.C. § 9-07-06 required, showed that the agreement did not state anything about the option terminating, and, thus, the option still existed because the language was clear and unambiguous regarding the option and meant there was no need under N.D.C.C. § 9-07-12 to consider the circumstances under which the option agreement was executed.

        Under the “doctrine of reasonable expectations”, which provides that form contracts be construed to include terms which the promisee could reasonably expect to be included, a “farm liability policy” which excluded claims arising from the use of “any recreational motor vehicle or aircraft” was construed to cover a claim arising from an aerial crop spraying accident, because the exclusion, although intended to exclude all aircraft, could be reasonably construed to exclude only recreational aircraft.

        The record amply supported the trial court’s finding, that sellers knew the bank would interpret a subordination agreement to give it priority in the paid-for parts inventory where the sellers were fully informed of the bank’s conditions for refinancing, their own witnesses testified that there were documents in their files that evidenced the bank’s request for subordination of their priority in the paid-for parts inventory, the sellers had sent a signed subordination agreement which the bank reasonably understood to grant the requested priority in the paid-for parts inventory, and never indicated to the bank that this subordination agreement was anything other than what the bank had requested.

       <p>
        In a teacher contract dispute, the “teacher shall” language in a grievance policy did not prohibit a teacher association from utilizing the grievance procedures set forth in an agreement when the grievance effected the terms and conditions of a majority of the teachers and concerned the interpretation of the agreement; a restrictive reading would have effectively ignored the purpose for the agreement as set forth by the parties. Moreover, nothing in the agreement prohibited the association from bringing a legal action after a grievance had been denied or negotiations had failed. Williston Educ. Ass'n v. Williston Pub. Sch.

       <p>
        In a dispute over a trust agreement, because the introductory language of one article and the general intent of the trust agreement showed that a husband and wife were to be the primary beneficiaries of the trust, an inconsistent provision regarding other potential beneficiaries was rejected as inconsistent under
   N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t09c9-07s9-07-18" target="_self">9-07-18</a></cite>. Therefore, a motion for summary judgment was properly granted for the husband, who was acting as a trustee and a personal representative for the wife after her death, when he transferred property to himself and revoked the trust; moreover, a motion to reconsider filed by the potential beneficiaries was denied.

      When a contract is partly written and partly printed, or when part of it is written or printed under the special directions of the parties and with a special view to their intention and the remainder is copied from a form originally prepared without special reference to the particular parties and particular contract in question, the written parts control the printed parts and the parts which are purely original control those which are copied from a form and if the two are absolutely repugnant the latter must be disregarded insofar as such repugnancy exists.

        Vendor’s recovery for waste was not precluded by liquidated damages clause contained in the contract for deed, as regardless of how expansive the terms of a contract may be, its coverage can only extend to those events which the parties intended, and to conclude that the parties intended the liquidated damages provision to cover waste would require an unreasonable interpretation of the contract, which is prohibited by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t09c9-07s9-07-18" target="_self">9-07-18</a></cite>.

        In a dispute over a trust agreement, because the introductory language of one article and the general intent of the trust agreement showed that a husband and wife were to be the primary beneficiaries of the trust, a provision regarding other potential beneficiaries was rejected as inconsistent under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t09c9-07s9-07-18" target="_self">9-07-18</a></cite>. Therefore, a motion for summary judgment was properly granted for the husband, who was acting as a trustee and a personal representative for the wife after her death, when he transferred property to himself and revoked the trust; moreover, a motion to reconsider filed by the potential beneficiaries was denied.

     <p>
      In cases of uncertainty not removed by the preceding rules, the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist. The promisor is presumed to be such party, except in a contract between a public officer or body, as such, and a private party, and in such case it is presumed that all uncertainty was caused by the private party.

        This section is applicable only when N.D.C.C. §§ 9-07-01 through 9-07-18 fail to resolve the ambiguity; the strict construction rule contained within this section is a rule of last resort and is not applicable to frustrate any clear intentions of the parties.

        This section, which requires an ambiguous contract to be construed against any party who has created the ambiguity, irrespective of that party’s bargaining position or level of expertise, is a rule of last resort which shall be applied only when other rules of construction do not resolve the ambiguity. Continental Casualty Co. v. Kinsey, 499 N.W.2d 574, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        The trial court erred in applying this rule of last resort where extrinsic evidence resolved the ambiguity in the contract at issue. Kaler v. Kraemer, 1999 ND 237, 603 N.W.2d 698, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 263</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        Where luggage disappeared after being checked with an airline, and the disappearance was under circumstances sufficiently unknown, puzzling, and baffling, to arouse wonder, curiosity, or speculation, it was a “mysterious disappearance” covered by the theft provisions of an insurance policy.

        In action on life insurance policy covering child, contention by insurer that child had not lived to be “at least 14 days old” as required by policy was without merit since period was not to be computed as fourteen 24-hour days as contended by insurer, but from first minute of day on which person was born to same minute of corresponding day completing period; ambiguity in policy’s provisions was construed most strongly against party that caused uncertainty of meaning. Scott v. National Travelers Life Ins. Co., 171 N.W.2d 749, 1969 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1969).

        A provision in the constitution and bylaws of a beneficial association providing that treatment would be limited to six months in cases demonstrated to be incurable did not permit a member to receive treatment for six months for such incurable disease and, after discharge for a period, entitle him to receive further treatment for the same disease. However, even after such a member had received the maximum six months’ treatment for such incurable ailment, the association would have been responsible for further treatment for other diseases occurring during such period of hospitalization and treatment even though the member may have been receiving care for the incurable disease as well. Bloom v. Northern Pac. Beneficial Ass'n, 193 N.W.2d 244, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1971).

        Provision of “farm liability policy” excluding coverage of claims arising out of the use of a “recreational motor vehicle or aircraft” and intended to exclude coverage of accidents involving any aircraft (not only “recreational” ones) was construed so that policy covered claim arising out of aerial crop spraying accident. Mills v. Agrichemical Aviation, 250 N.W.2d 663, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 219</cite> (N.D. 1977).

        When an ambiguity exists, if one interpretation of the policy language will impose liability on the insurer and the other will not, the interpretation favorable to the insured will be adopted. Heitkamp v. Milbank Mut. Ins. Co., 383 N.W.2d 834, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        The ambiguity in the policy created a question of coverage which the factfinder resolved in favor of the insured, and that resolution is consistent with the North Dakota Supreme Court’s recognized rule of interpretation that ambiguities are to be construed, if at all possible, in favor of the insured. Heitkamp v. Milbank Mut. Ins. Co., 383 N.W.2d 834, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 282</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        The district court properly construed the ambiguous terms “farm implements” and “motor vehicle” as excluding the insured’s pickup truck from coverage and did not err in failing to construe the language of the policy against the insurer and in favor of the insured pursuant to this section where the district court interpreted the contractual language by reference to the circumstances under which the contract was made and also gave effect to the ascertainable mutual intent of the parties at the time of contracting. Walle Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sweeney, 419 N.W.2d 176, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>
        Where endorsement listed only two policy holders as the named insureds and the supplemental declaration sheet issued at the same time listed four policy holders, the endorsement and the supplemental declaration sheet were inconsistent, and the policy was ambiguous on the crucial question whether individual was a named insured for whom liability coverage was excluded. The ambiguity was construed strictly against defendant and, based on the endorsement language, the individual was not a named insured under the policy and, thus, the injury to him was covered. Johnson v. Center Mut. Ins. Co., 529 N.W.2d 568, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       <p>
        In a breach of contract action arising from a storm sewer improvement project, the court declined to engraft an exception for uncontemplated delays into the plain and broad language of a no damages for delay clause in part because N.D.C.C. § 9-07-19 reflected a preference for construing contracts with public entities in favor of the public entity.

        If no time is specified by the contract for performance of an act, the law allows reasonable time under the circumstances. Braithwaite v. Aikin, 1 N.D. 455, 48 N.W. 354, 1891 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1891).

       <p>
        Where the parties have failed to specify a time for performance, the law will allow a reasonable time; determination of what a reasonable time may be is a question of fact, depending upon the particular circumstances of each case.

        Where contract for the sale of real estate contained both a printed and handwritten provision stating “time is of the essence”, buyer was not entitled to specific performance of the contract where he failed to perform on the precise day specified in the contract. E. E. E., Inc. v. Hanson, 318 N.W.2d 101, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 262</cite> (N.D. 1982).

        District court did not err by finding that time was of the essence under N.D.C.C. § 9-07-23 in exercising the option to terminate the lease and that the landowners’
   untimely notice constituted an anticipatory breach of the lease because the lease provided that the option to terminate had to be executed by providing written notice by September 1 of each year and notice was not provided until September 15.

        That time is of the essence of a contract need not be declared in so many words, it being sufficient to show the intention of the parties to that effect. Asplund v. Danielson, 56 N.D. 485, 217 N.W. 848, 1928 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1928).

        Where farmer entered contract with grain elevator to deliver corn and written contract specified “June delivery”, it was question for jury whether time was of the essence in this agreement, and trial court’s order for summary judgment was reversed. Farmers Elevator Co. v. David, 234 N.W.2d 26, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a settlement agreement, the designation of a specific time for a payment, with consequences for failure to make the payment by that time, unambiguously manifested an intent that time was of the essence for the settlement agreement. When one party failed to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement, the other party was entitled to have the full amount of the original judgment reinstated.

        Trial court did not err in finding that the owner of the nail salon did not establish that the construction company orally agreed that the work would be done before Thanksgiving 2013, or by a specific date and that the construction company's version of the completion date was more credible than the owner's version of the completion date because the evidence in the record supported the district court's findings; and the supreme court was not left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake in finding there was no agreement for a specific completion date for the project, and the supreme court concluded that the trial court's findings about the completion date were not clearly erroneous.

        When a contract provision is inconsistent with fair and honorable dealing, contrary to sound policy and offensive to good morals, courts have the authority to declare the provision void as against public policy.

        Because allowing a person convicted of felony fraud in connection with real estate transactions to retain his real estate license and continue business during his appeal of conviction would be contrary to public policy, real estate commission had no authority to agree to refrain from disciplinary action pending resolution of broker’s appeal of his conviction.

Coverage was precluded as a matter of law by intentional acts exclusions and by the public policy stated in N.D.C.C. §§ 9-08-02, 26.1-32-04; however, the jury’s findings did not relieve the insurer of the duty to defend, which was determined by the allegations in the underlying complaint.

        In a case arising from a near-drowning at a summer camp, an argument that an association was unable to exonerate itself from willful acts was not addressed on appeal because the complaint only pled a theory of negligence; case law should have given notice to specifically plead intentional or willful acts if that was what was being alleged.

        In order to uphold a liquidated damages contract clause as valid, there must be a finding that the damages stemming from a breach of contract are impractical or extremely difficult to ascertain at the time the contract was entered, there was a reasonable endeavor by the parties to fix their compensation, and the amount stipulated as liquidated damages bears a reasonable relation to the probable damages and is not disproportionate to any damages reasonably anticipated. Eddy v. Lee, 312 N.W.2d 326, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 407</cite> (N.D. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party who seeks to fit within the exception in this section and trigger the presumed damages clause must provide certain foundational facts upon which the trial court may make findings. These foundational facts include: (1) the difficulty of measuring damages at the time of contract formation; (2) a reasonable attempt by the parties to fix damages; and (3) a reasonable relationship between the damages stipulated to and the amount that may be reasonably anticipated under the circumstances. Federal Land Bank v. Woell, 415 N.W.2d 500, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 434</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to raise the rebuttable presumption in this section that the amount set forth as liquidated damages constitutes the actual loss or damage sustained by breach of the contract, the party wishing to rely upon it must introduce credible evidence: (1) that at the time the contract was made the damages in the event of breach were incapable or very difficult of accurate estimation; (2) that there was a reasonable endeavor by the parties to fix their compensation; and (3) that the amount stipulated bears a reasonable relation to the probable damages and is not disproportionate to any damages reasonably to be anticipated. Coldwell Banker-First Realty v. Meide &amp; Son, 422 N.W.2d 375, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 78</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A contract provision, to be upheld as a valid liquidated damages clause, must not only meet the requirements of this section, but also must fulfill the requirements imposed by case law. Dosland v. Netland, 424 N.W.2d 141, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory and case law requirements which must be fulfilled in order for a contract provision to be upheld as a valid liquidated-damages clause are that (1) the damages stemming from a breach of contract are impracticable or extremely difficult to ascertain at the time the contract was entered; (2) there was a reasonable endeavor by the parties to fix their compensation; and (3) the amount stipulated bears a reasonable relation to the probable damages and is not disproportionate to any damages reasonably to be anticipated. Hagan v. Havnvik, 421 N.W.2d 56, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Three foundational facts are critical to the inquiry whether a particular provision is a valid liquidated damages clause or a void penalty: 1) Were the damages upon breach very difficult to estimate at the time the contract was entered?; 2) Was there a reasonable endeavor by the parties to fix compensation?; and 3) Does the amount stipulated bear a reasonable relationship to the damages reasonably to be anticipated upon breach? City of Fargo v. Case Dev. Co., 401 N.W.2d 529, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liquidated damage provisions which apply to varying degrees of breach should be upheld if they are reasonable as to the actual breach which has occurred. City of Fargo v. Case Dev. Co., 401 N.W.2d 529, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        Under this section, a liquidated damages provision need not state a sum certain, but may provide for damages to be calculated by the use of an agreed method of computing loss with the aid of extrinsic evidence.

        Where experienced parties had multiple opportunities to examine the contract, including the liquidated damages clause, and did in fact suggest changes which were incorporated into the parties’ final agreement, the evidence supported the trial court’s finding that the liquidated damages clause was the result of a reasonable endeavor by the parties to fix compensation. City of Fargo v. Case Dev. Co., 401 N.W.2d 529, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 252</cite> (N.D. 1987).

        There was evidence to support the trial court’s finding that the amount of liquidated damages in an exclusive real estate listing agreement was reasonably related to the probable damages and not disproportionate to any damages reasonably anticipated, where the trial court found the amount of damages stipulated to be $232,780, a sum equal to the sales commissions due under the contract, and there was testimony that the broker would have received $352,000 in management fees had the developer performed the contract.

       <p>
        In a property management dispute, a partnership and corporations argued that amount of liquidated damages did not bear a reasonable relation to probable damages and was disproportionate to any damages reasonably anticipated; however, the individuals behind the partnership and the corporations had multiple attorneys available to them, and they were experienced and knowledgeable business people; thus, the evidence supported the finding that the liquidated damages clauses were the result of a reasonable endeavor by the parties to fix compensation.

        Where noncompetition agreement as part of business purchase transaction went beyond the territorial scope permitted by this section, the agreement was not completely void, but its enforceability was limited to the county where the property and business were located and conducted.

        Where a noncompetition agreement purported to restrict competition statewide, this section invalidated the agreement in all but one county; therefore, the seller’s competition in another county did not constitute a breach, and the buyer was not entitled to setoff of liquidated damages against his default of payment. Herman v. Newman Signs, 417 N.W.2d 179, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 450</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        If it does not appear that the good will of a business is sold as a part of the transaction, an oral agreement to refrain from engaging in such business is in restraint of trade and is void.

       <p>
        If the seller of the good will of a business promises not to engage in a similar business in more than one county or city, that is, in a larger area than is permitted by this section, the promise is unenforceable only in the area in excess of the permissible area of restraint.

        Terms that completely described the type of business restriction, the duration of the restriction, and the geographic limitation of the restriction, left no doubt there were no other essential non-competition terms left for agreement between the parties, and objectively evidenced the parties’ mutual intent to create an enforceable non-competition agreement.

        When a party sells a business, and as part of the sale, agrees not to engage in the same or similar business in the same area for a particular and reasonable length of time, good will, although not specifically mentioned, is a subject of the sale and passes as an incident of the transfer.

        In a tort action surrounding the derailment of a freight train and the subsequent release of anyhdrous ammonia gases into the air, there was no question that a named plaintiff who had successfully had a release of liability form he signed overturned because it was signed within the statutory “cooling off” period set forth in N.D.C.C. § 9-08-08 could serve as an adequate representative of those potential class members who signed releases in that period, but proposed class members who signed releases outside the “cooling-off period ,” had purportedly already obtained the relief the named plaintiffs sought; the validity of the releases signed after the “cooling-off period” was not an essential part of the named plaintiff’s claims. As such, the named plaintiffs were not adequate representatives of the proposed class members who entered into releases with CPR after the “cooling-off period.”

      Any person sustaining personal injuries, or in case of the person’s death, the person’s personal representative, may elect at any time within six months after the date of such injury to avoid any settlement, adjustment, or contract made in connection therewith within the time mentioned in section 9-08-08, by a notice in writing to that effect. The bringing of an action to recover damages for such injuries avoids any such settlement or adjustment. Whenever an action is commenced within the period of time herein limited to recover such damages, the amount received by the injured person, or the injured person’s representative, in case of the injured person’s death, in any such settlement or adjustment is not a bar to the prosecution of the action but may be set up as an offset or counterclaim to the amount of damages recoverable, if any, or applied toward payment of any judgment recovered in any such action if such amount so received by the injured person or the injured person’s representative has not been pleaded specifically as an offset or counterclaim.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When considering whether a settlement agreement between divorcing parties should be enforced, district courts should make two findings: (1) whether the agreement is free from mistake, duress, menace, fraud or undue influence and (2) whether the agreement is unconscionable. Weber v. Weber, 1999 ND 11, 589 N.W.2d 358, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in finding that a settlement agreement was not unconscionable because, inter alia, the agreement was a fair and reasonable disposition of the property of the parties, there was no evidence that the husband had entered the agreement by mistake, or that his signature was obtained by fraud, duress, menace, or undue influence, and, although the parties’
   agreement mentioned reconciliation, the plain language of the agreement contemplated it would govern if the parties decided to pursue a divorce.
   Kramer v. Kramer, 2006 ND 64, 711 N.W.2d 164, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in finding that a settlement agreement was not unconscionable merely because the husband was not represented by counsel when he signed the written agreement dividing their marital property; this was not, by itself, sufficient justification for relief from a judgment. Furthermore, there was some evidence that the husband had contacted an attorney about the agreement and was pleased that the wife’s attorney could prepare the agreement for half of what the other attorney had quoted.
   Kramer v. Kramer, 2006 ND 64, 711 N.W.2d 164, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under N.D.C.C. § 14-05-24, the property settlement agreement in a divorce case could not be considered unconscionable under N.D.C.C. § 9-09-02(1) either when adopted by the trial court or when the ex-wife’s remainder interest and the new appraised property values were considered in the property distribution because (1) the parties were represented by counsel throughout those proceedings, and negotiations over the settlement agreement spanned 18 months, (2) the wife presented evidence that the value of one-half of her remainder interest in the property under Internal Revenue Service rules, using property tax values the ex-husband originally used in the settlement agreement, would be $ 43,290, and (3) even if the full fee simple value of $ 250,000 were added and the husband earned six percent interest on his financial accounts from the time the values of those accounts were listed in the settlement agreement, she would have received 54% and he would have received 46% of the marital property, which was not inequitable; thus, the trial court did not err in denying the husband’s motion for a new trial.

        In an action for separation from bed and board where the court found that the agreement of separation was a “forced agreement” obtained “without permitting her the benefit of counsel” and that the plaintiff had “repudiated” it, it was a finding that the agreement had been rescinded pursuant to the statutes. Bourrett v. Bourrett, 99 N.W.2d 325, 1959 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exercise of the statutory rescinding power in an applicable situation abrogates and undoes the contract from the beginning, so that the transaction is thereby caused to be left without remaining form or subtance. And it is not open to a party to escape that obliterating consequence, for when he once elects, he must abide by his decision. Woodhull v.

        Where plaintiff borrower moved into her home and discovered that the septic system was inadequate, plaintiff’s attempts to rescind the financing contract with the bank and the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency were inappropriate as the appropriate remedy was against the home’s seller; the purchase of the home and the financing of that purchase were separate and distinct transactions. Furthermore, any alleged mutual mistake as to the condition of the property purchased with the proceeds of the promissory note did not go to the essence of the parties’

        Brothers were not entitled to set aside and have declared null and void a certain deed to eight, instead of four, mineral acres, executed by them and given to attorney as a contingent fee for legal service in getting wells drilled on their property, discovered two days after deed was signed, where they waited twenty months before they commenced action.

        Where at the time the parties executed May, 1987 settlement agreement, promissory note, and warranty deed, they erroneously believed that April, 1984 collateral real estate mortgage was valid and enforceable, the parties’ mutual mistake as to the status of the collateral real estate mortgage was clearly material to the formation of the agreement. Viewed either as a mutual mistake of fact under N.D.C.C. § 9-03-13(2) or of law under N.D.C.C. § 9-03-14(1), the parties’ erroneous belief as to the validity of the collateral real estate mortgage warranted rescission of the May, 1987 settlement agreement, note, and deed as a matter of law.

      <li id="t09c9-09s9-09-04ol12">
       The party rescinding shall restore to the other party everything of value which the party rescinding has received from the other party under the contract or must offer to restore the same upon condition that such party shall do likewise, unless the latter is unable or positively refuses to do so.

        Under N.D.C.C. § 28-01-16, an action for rescission based on failure of consideration accrues when the facts which constitute the failure of consideration have been, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have been, discovered by the party applying for relief. Schmidt v. Grand Forks Country Club, 460 N.W.2d 125, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>

        Principles relating to whether a plaintiff has waived rights of rescission also apply when determining when cause of action for rescission has accrued: action for rescission accrues when plaintiff has notice of facts and circumstances which would put a person of ordinary prudence and intelligence on inquiry.

        The phrase “aware of his right to rescind” adds very little in determining whether or not the party under the circumstances acted reasonably to rescind. A party has a duty to find out what the facts actually are and then act promptly to find out what legal rights result from those facts; failure to do so may constitute a waiver of the right to rescind.

        A rescission action at law is essentially an action for restitution based upon a party’s prior unilateral rescission, whereas an action in equity seeks to have the court terminate the contract and order restoration.

        Plaintiff may not invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel against a defendant unless the plaintiff exercises due diligence in commencing the appropriate legal proceeding after the circumstances giving rise to estoppel have ceased to be operational, that is, after plaintiff has notice, actual or constructive, that he must resort to legal recourse and may no longer rely upon agreements, promises, representations to the contrary, or conduct or deceptive practices which may have lulled him into a sense of security.

        The doctrine of equitable estoppel may operate to preclude the application of a statute of limitations as a defense by one whose actions mislead another, thereby inducing him to not file a claim within the statute of limitations. Thus, a delay may be excusable where, provided it is not unreasonably protracted, it is induced by defendant’s promises, suggestions, or assurances which, if carried into effect, would result in a solution or adjustment without litigation.

        One who purchased machinery under a single indivisible contract could not rescind the contract where he failed to return a portion of the machinery. Uhrig v. J. I. Case Threshing Mach. Co., 64 N.D. 189, 250 N.W. 922, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 265</cite> (N.D. 1933).

        Compliance with subsections 1 and 2 of this section is a condition precedent to an action to rescind, but where the party seeking to rescind has received nothing of value, there is nothing to restore and subsection 2 does not apply. Volk v. Volk, 121 N.W.2d 701 (N.D. 1963), decided prior to the enactment of the Uniform Probate Code.

        In seeking to rescind contract for deed, purchaser’s offer to restore only the premises, without offering to restore the rents collected or the reasonable value of the use of the premises for the period the purchaser occupied the building, failed to satisfy the restoration of value requirement of this section.

        Where a borrower moved into her home and discovered that the septic system was inadequate, the borrower’s attempts to rescind the contract with the bank and the North Dakota Housing Finance Agency (NDFHA) were inappropriate as the appropriate remedy was against the home’s seller; borrower failed to follow the procedures for rescission under
   N.D.C.C. § 9-09-04(2) where her notice of rescission offered to restore the premises to the Bank and NDFHA as she only received money from these parties and, therefore, in order to rescind the note and mortgage against the Bank and NDHFA, she would have to restore the money they provided in order to place the parties in their original position and restore the status quo.

        District court abused its discretion in granting a motion for relief from judgment based on a clerical mistake or error because, although the district court might have intended to put the parties back into their original positions before invalidated real property transactions, the relief requested was beyond the record evidence in the initial trial and sought a substantive change to the judgment. The district court ordered the reimbursement of fees and the payment of rental value. Erickson v. Olsen, 2016 ND 33, 875 N.W.2d 535, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 42</cite> (N.D. 2016).

        N.D.C.C. §§ 9-08-08 and 9-08-09 do not operate as statute of limitation for this section, but rather such sections provide an additional remedy; therefore, an action brought under this section is subject only to statute of limitations contained in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.28.html#t28c28-01s28-01-16" target="_blank">28-01-16</a></cite>.

        Rescission of contract for purchase of realty would not be allowed where: (1) erroneous description of property had been inserted in contract by mutual mistake and could be corrected by reformation; (2) purchasers did not offer to account for rents collected or to pay reasonable value of use and occupation of premises; and (3) purchasers waived requirement that abstract of title showing good and marketable title be furnished by failing to demand it until they had been in possession for more than eight years. However, since purchasers had paid more than two-thirds of principal and interest on purchase price and had made improvements and paid taxes, vendors were allowed a reasonable time to remedy defects in title and purchasers allowed additional time in which to tender full performance of contract.

        The determination of prompt rescission does not depend alone upon the lapse of time, but also upon the circumstances of each particular case; whether or not notice of rescission is timely is a question of fact.

        An action for rescission brought under this section is subject to the six-year statute of limitations contained in N.D.C.C. § 28-01-16(1). However, a party who fails to promptly exercise the right of rescission upon discovery of the facts necessary to rescind waives that right. Schmidt v.

        Where a grantee, after discovery of a breach of the covenant of seizin, remained in possession of the premises, and applied for a loan, and defied all the grantor’s efforts to remove him, he lost the right to rescind.

        Lessors waived right to rescind oil, gas, and mineral leases by not acting promptly as required by subsection 1 of this section after payment of their drafts, issued to pay the rentals provided by their leases, was refused, and by their subsequent negotiations with the lessees relative to the payment thereof. Daniel v. Hamilton, 61 N.W.2d 281, 1953 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 1953).

        Where a party to a contract ordered the other to cease performance but continued to pay for the services of the nonperforming party, a successor to the rights of the ordering party could not sue for rescission of the contract on the basis of nonperformance when the successor knew of the order to cease performance and also continued to pay for the service.

        Plaintiffs waived their right to rescind agreement based upon defendant’s breach where plaintiffs did not act to rescind until more than two and one-half years after they were aware of the facts constituting the breach and during that two and one-half years they acted in various ways which were inconsistent with a rescission of the agreement.

        The determination of whether or not a party has waived the right to rescind an agreement by failure to act promptly is a question of law for the court to determine. Lindemann v. Lindemann, 336 N.W.2d 112, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1983).

J. R. Watkins Medical Co. v. Payne, 47 N.D. 100, 180 N.W. 968, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 81</cite> (N.D. 1920).

       <p>
        The filling of blanks in a surety bond by the creditor, when not expressly or impliedly authorized, so as to contain the amount of the existing indebtedness owing by the principal to the creditor, constitutes a material alteration which avoids the instrument. J. R. Watkins Co. v. Keeney, 52 N.D. 280, 201 N.W. 833, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1924).

       <p>
        Failure of a bank to make a loan after negotiations does not create an inference that the bank originally promised to make a loan. If any inference could be drawn from such negotiations, it is that the bank originally hoped to provide future financial assistance but was unable to do so when the course of events rendered the loan economically unfeasible.

        If the essential elements of actual fraud are present, a plaintiff can recover such damages as he has sustained through relying on the misrepresentation of a defendant in any transaction, whereby plaintiff has been induced to part with property or surrender some legal right, and thereby suffered loss and injury. Guild v. More, 32 N.D. 432, 155 N.W. 44, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of frauds did not preclude appellants’ deceit claim; it was based on an alleged deliberate misrepresentation of fact by appellee, and appellants claimed they relied on the misrepresentations and were deceived into transferring property. Appellants were seeking damages for reliance on the alleged misrepresentations, not enforcement of any agreement. McDougall v. AgCountry Farm Credit Servs., PCA, 2020 ND 6, 937 N.W.2d 546, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The term “obligation” in the statute providing for assignability and survivorship of things in action comprehends only a legal duty from contract or by operation of law from a status voluntarily assumed. Grabow v. Bergeth, 59 N.D. 214, 229 N.W. 282, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1930).

       <p>
        Wrongful death claim under N.D.C.C. § 32-21-01 fell squarely within the protections of N.D.C.C. §§ 9-10-01 and 9-10-06 because, in this case, bar owners undertook a duty to act with due care when they physically ejected an intoxicated person from their bar in the midst of winter. Because there was a factual dispute as to whether the bar owners exercised reasonable and ordinary care in ejecting the decedent from the bar a second time, and whether injury or death was foreseeable as a result of the ejection, judgment on the pleadings was not appropriate.
   Hoff v. Elkhorn Bar, 613 F. Supp. 2d 1146, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58752 (D.N.D. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under N.D.C.C. §§ 9-10-01 and 9-10-06, the district court erred by deciding only whether the landowner had a duty to protect plaintiff from the driver’s presumed negligence and failing to analyze whether the landowner had a separate duty to avoid injury to plaintiff under general negligence principles or under premises liability law.
   Saltsman v. Sharp, 2011 ND 172, 803 N.W.2d 553, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 172</cite> (N.D. 2011).

        Actual fraud, with damage, constitutes actionable deceit. Beare v. Wright, 14 N.D. 26, 103 N.W. 632, 1905 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1905).

        Two of the essential elements of actionable deceit are a willful misrepresentation, and an intent thereby to induce another to alter his position. Hart v. Evanson, 14 N.D. 570, 105 N.W. 942 (N.D. 1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a misrepresentation of law is not an actionable deceit in North Dakota, a statement amounting to a representation of the legal effect of facts not disclosed or otherwise known to the recipient, which may be justifiably interpreted by it as implying the existence of the facts which substantiate the statement, is actionable. Nodak Oil Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 533 F.2d 401, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 11831 (8th Cir. N.D. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where proof of actual damage proximately caused by the misrepresentation or nondisclosure is an essential element of a tort action for fraud and deceit, and plaintiffs presented no evidence showing a causal connection between defendants’ behavior and plaintiffs’ inability to farm their property, summary judgment dismissal of the plaintiffs’ fraud and deceit claim was proper. Schneider v. Schaaf, 1999 ND 235, 603 N.W.2d 869, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 262</cite> (N.D. 1999).

        A fraud action brought under the provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 9-03, applies only to misrepresentations between parties to a contract, while deceit under the provisions of this chapter applies where there is no contract between the parties. Olson v. Fraase, 421 N.W.2d 820, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>
        The only significant distinction between the torts of fraud and deceit is whether the wrongdoer happens to be a party to a contract. The conduct prohibited under the separate statutory definitions of fraud and deceit is substantially identical and, for purposes of the punitive damages statute, fraud and deceit are synonymous. Dewey v. Lutz, 462 N.W.2d 435, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Technically, fraud under N.D.C.C. ch. 9-03 applies only when there is a contract between the parties; deceit under this chapter applies when there is no contract between the parties, nevertheless, conduct can be both fraudulent and deceitful. Dewey v. Lutz, 462 N.W.2d 435, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1990).

Statements of value and predictions of future earnings or profits fall within the class of statements whose truth or falsity cannot be precisely determined and which are not, therefore, actionable as misrepresentations of fact and statements of opinion, as, for example, expressions by the seller commending the thing he is selling, have been held not actionable even though they are false.

        The measure of damages in an action for deceit, in the absence of a claim for special or exemplary damages, is the difference in value in what was received or parted with, or what would have been received or parted with had the representations been true.

        If the essential elements of actual fraud are present, a plaintiff can recover such damages as he has sustained through relying on the misrepresentations of a defendant in any transaction, whereby plaintiff has been induced to part with property or surrender some legal right, and thereby suffered loss and injury.

        A warehouseman was liable for conversion of an automobile where he refused to deliver it to the true owner upon demand. Cunningham v. Lahr Motor Sales Co., 50 N.D. 846, 198 N.W. 347, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1924).

        It was not the intention of the legislature, in enacting former section 60-08-17, to change the fundamental rules of liability, contained in this section, further than to excuse a warehouseman for refusing to deliver goods to which an adverse claim is made during such reasonable time as may be required to ascertain the validity of the claim or to institute an action to compel the claimants to litigate the claim.

        Both the employer of plaintiff and the manufacturer of the machine on which plaintiff was working when injured were liable where neither defendant gave the inexperienced plaintiff any warning of the dangers involved in working on the new potato-harvesting machine, where such dangers were not obvious to the plaintiff, and where a partially shielded sprocket and unshielded chain on the machine were within easy reach and were natural objects for plaintiff’s hand to contact in search of support when plaintiff lost her balance and fell with the result that plaintiff’s hand was caught in the chain and sprocket.

        Wrongful death claim under N.D.C.C. § 32-21-01 fell squarely within the protections of N.D.C.C. §§ 9-10-01 and 9-10-06 because, in this case, bar owners undertook a duty to act with due care when they physically ejected an intoxicated person from their bar in the midst of winter. Because there was a factual dispute as to whether the bar owners exercised reasonable and ordinary care in ejecting the decedent from the bar a second time, and whether injury or death was foreseeable as a result of the ejection, judgment on the pleadings was not appropriate.

        Under N.D.C.C. §§ 9-10-01 and 9-10-06, the district court erred by deciding only whether the landowner had a duty to protect plaintiff from the driver’s presumed negligence and failing to analyze whether the landowner had a separate duty to avoid injury to plaintiff under general negligence principles or under premises liability law.

        Although the shareholder argued that the prohibition on payment of further dividends should not be given effect because no purchase agreement was prepared as called for by the December 28, 2001, offer and because the closing was delayed beyond the contemplated closing date of the end of March 2002, the shareholder accepted payment for his shares of stock when the sale was finally closed on September 12, 2002; a party who accepts performance in a manner different from that required by contract acquiesces in any nonconforming performance.

       District court erred in denying an assignee’s application for a charging order against a second guarantor because the assignee could statutorily take an assignment of a bank against two guarantors, the assignee could then take an assignment of the judgment from the first guarantor to enforce his right of contribution from the second guarantor for the “unsatisfied amount of the judgment,” and the second guarantor did not present any evidence contesting the amount of his proportional share of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment, and any execution sought against the second guarantor was only for his proportionate share.

      A partial performance of an indivisible obligation extinguishes a corresponding proportion thereof if the benefit of such performance is retained voluntarily by the creditor, but not otherwise. If such partial performance is of such a nature that the creditor cannot avoid retaining it without injuring the creditor’s own property, the creditor’s retention thereof is not presumed to be voluntary.

      When a debtor under several obligations to another does an act by way of performance, in whole or in part, which is applicable equally to two or more of such obligations, such performance must be applied as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t09c9-12s9-12-07ol11">
       If, at the time of the performance, the intention or desire of the debtor that such performance should be applied to the extinction of any particular obligation is manifested to the creditor, it must be applied in such manner.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c9-12s9-12-07ol12">
       If no such application is then made, the creditor, within a reasonable time after such performance, may apply it toward the extinction of any obligation the performance of which was due to the creditor from the debtor at the time of such performance, except that if similar obligations were due to the creditor both individually and as a trustee, unless otherwise directed by the debtor, the creditor shall apply the performance to the extinction of all such obligations in equal proportion. An application once made by the creditor cannot be rescinded without the consent of the debtor.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c9-12s9-12-07ol13">
       If neither party makes such application within the time prescribed herein, the performance must be applied to the extinction of obligations in the following order, and if there is more than one obligation of a particular class, to the extinction of all in that class ratably.

        If a debtor gives no specific instructions as to the application of payment, the creditor may apply it to any one of the secured claims or to the most precarious. Depositors' Holding Co. v. Brown, 64 N.D. 222, 251 N.W. 295, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D. 1933).

        Absent a contrary agreement between the parties, payments applied to child support arrearages should be applied first to any interest due on the earliest maturing child support payment, and then to any principal due on that payment, with any excess going to the next earliest maturing support payment, to be applied in the same manner, first to interest, then to principal.

        A direction as to the application of a payment made prior to payment and not changed at or before payment sufficiently manifests the debts of the debtor as to application. First Nat'l Bank v. Roberts, 2 N.D. 195, 49 N.W. 722, 1891 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        Debtor did not communicate to creditor how checks were to be applied by mere notation on face of the checks as written by third party, so that creditor acted properly under this section in applying payments to oldest debts first, including debt secured by an unrecorded retail installment contract. Hansen v. Fettig, 179 N.W.2d 739, 1970 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 134</cite> (N.D. 1970).

        It was not clearly erroneous to find debtors did not manifest an intent, under
   N.D.C.C. § 9-12-07(1), to first apply credit account payments to a ring because the evidence showed the debtors had no such agreement with a seller and manifested no such intent.

        The funds applied by the bank to reduce the loan balance did not come from a voluntary payment by defendant but rather via court-ordered liquidation of the collateral. This does not constitute voluntary performance. State Bank v. Nester, 385 N.W.2d 95, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        In a divorce case, a husband was not purged of contempt as to unpaid spousal support by his surety’s payment on a supersedeas bond; the wife was entitled to apply the surety’s payment to unpaid property distribution obligations because the husband did not pay voluntarily and did not request a particular allocation until after payment was made.

        If the covenants of a contract for the sale of land are mutual and dependent, and the vendor’s obligation to convey depends upon certain payments, and time is not of the essence of the contract, the vendee can place the vendor in default by tendering performance, and without such tender he cannot rescind the contract and recover back the payments made.

        Where borrower did not tender the February and March 1993 mortgage payments until May 4, 1993, so that by that time the April and May 1993 payments were also delinquent, the tendered payment did not bring the loan current; borrower therefore did not tender the performance of his obligation, but only tendered partial performance. While an obligation is extinguished by an offer of performance intended to extinguish the obligation, an offer of partial performance is of no effect and borrower was not released from any obligation to pay interest on the debt.

       <p>
        In a suit brought by mineral interest holders (holders) against a petroleum company seeking a declaration that an oil and gas lease had not been effectively renewed, the petroleum company’s motion for summary judgment was granted because the holders’
   failure to timely object to the uncertified check tendered by the petroleum company constituted an implied-in-law waiver under N.D.C.C. § 9-12-18 of the option’s requirement for tender of a certified check, and the their objection after the deadline for exercising the option was untimely and ineffective; as a consequence, there was no genuine issue of material fact that the petroleum company’s tender of payment effectively exercised the option to renew the lease and the lease was thereby renewed.

   failure to timely object to the uncertified check tendered by the petroleum company constituted an implied-in-law waiver under N.D.C.C. § 9-12-18 of the option’s requirement for tender of a certified check, and the their objection after the deadline for exercising the option was untimely and ineffective; as a consequence, there was no genuine issue of material fact that the petroleum company’s tender of payment effectively exercised the option to renew the lease and the lease was thereby renewed.
   Frandson v. Oasis Petroleum N. Am., LLC, 870 F. Supp. 2d 726, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59003 (D.N.D. 2012).

      Any lien, encumbrance, or cloud affecting or related to the title to real property, when the only obligation concerns the payment of a sum certain in money to a specified creditor when the creditor, or the creditor’s heirs, successors, or assigns cannot be located, may be extinguished as provided by this section and section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t09c9-12s9-12-29" target="_self">9-12-29</a></cite>. The debtor shall deposit with the county treasurer the debtor’s affidavit to the effect that the debtor has made a careful, diligent, and good-faith search for the creditor and the creditor cannot be found. The debtor shall also deposit with the county treasurer the full amount of the debt, including all interest accumulated to the date of the deposit. The affidavit together with notice of the deposit, specifying the amount of the deposit, specifying that the purpose of the deposit is to discharge the lien, encumbrance, or cloud, and specifically describing the real property, must be published at the expense of the debtor once a week for three successive weeks in the official county newspaper in all counties in which the real property is situated.

     <p>
      The creditor is entitled to claim the amount of money from the county treasurer within nine months of the date of deposit upon a showing to the county treasurer of a satisfaction of the lien, encumbrance, or cloud which includes an indication by the recorder that the satisfaction has been duly recorded. If the creditor does not claim the money in nine months from the date of first publication of the notice, the money, a copy of the debtor’s affidavit, and a copy of the published notice must be forwarded by the county treasurer to the state land commissioner for deposit to the credit of the state of North Dakota for the use and benefit of the common schools trust fund of the state. At the same time these items are forwarded to the state land commissioner, the county treasurer shall record in the office of the recorder a notice to the effect that the lien, encumbrance, or cloud affecting or related to the title to the real property, giving the specific legal description of the property, has been discharged by the procedures set out in section 9-12-28 and this section. The debtor shall pay the recorder’s fees for recording the county treasurer’s notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      At any time after the original nine-month period, the creditor, or the creditor’s heirs, successors, or assigns, may claim the full amount of the original deposit without any interest or penalty from the state administrator of abandoned property in the manner specified in chapter 47-30.2 for claiming the proceeds of other abandoned and unclaimed property.

        Trustees’
   reliance on N.D.C.C. § 9-13-02 was misplaced where, although the stock purchase agreement did not foreclose the possibility of further dividends, neither did it guarantee that further dividends would be declared before the closing, and the trustee’s plans to continue to seek a dividend after he signed the stock purchase agreement could not be construed to be a guarantee of a dividend that would have materially affected his decision to enter into the agreement if further dividends were not forthcoming; the trustee had no knowledge whether the board would or would not approve distribution of a dividend before he signed the agreement, which contained a mutual release with respect to all claims arising from the sale; therefore, the statute was inapplicable under the circumstances.

        Court properly enjoined the owner from preventing the planned unit development’s (PUD) right to access the owner’s property for lawn care, snow removal and other activities authorized by the amended declaration, because there was a reasonable inference the owner offered the check on the condition that her 2007 assessments for snow removal would be discharged, and there was an inference of satisfaction when the PUD endorsed and deposited the check; the PUD accepted and cashed the March 2007 check for $70 and this was in acceptance of the owner’s offer to pay in full for the 2007 snow removal.

        Negotiation of check without evidence of mutual assent did not constitute accord and satisfaction, and plaintiff met the general contract requirement of placing disputed claims in writing before acceptance of final payment by letter setting forth his claims and requesting additional amount.

        An essential element of satisfaction is an assent or meeting of the minds. Hochstetler v. Graber, 78 N.D. 90, 48 N.W.2d 15, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 1951).

        The defense of accord and satisfaction contemplates the mutual assent of the parties to modify their rights and obligations regarding each other. Mougey v. Salzwedel, 401 N.W.2d 509, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 1987).

       <p>
        Whether there is accord and satisfaction is question of fact and where conflicting evidence is presented is question for jury; thus, where purchaser of automobile paid part of repair bill in order to get automobile back, but told both distributor and his employees that he was not satisfied and they would be hearing from him, purchaser’s testimony that he never intended to settle all his claims against defendants by accepting payment for half the cost of parts used in repairing car was evidence that there was no meeting of minds, therefore question of accord and satisfaction should have been presented to jury. Frank v. Daimler--Benz, A. G., 226 N.W.2d 143, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless the evidence in a case is such that reasonable persons can draw but one conclusion, the question whether or not there has been an accord and satisfaction is a question of fact.
   Herb Hill Ins. v. Radtke, 380 N.W.2d 651, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1986).

       <p>
        Where the evidence was highly disputed and easily capable of leading reasonable persons to more than one conclusion, the court’s finding that there was an unsatisfied accord as opposed to a novation was a question of fact subject to the clearly erroneous standard of

        If the debtor sends to the creditor a check which is not paid by the bank, the burden of proof that the bank was insolvent at the time of payment falls upon the creditor. Schafer v. Olson, 24 N.D. 542, 139 N.W. 983, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1912).
