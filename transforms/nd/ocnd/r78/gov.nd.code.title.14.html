                            In determining incapacity of a grantor, such as to render his deed invalid, the court must be satisfied that the grantor was not in a situation to transact that particular business rationally. On the one hand, it is not necessary to show that he was capable
                            of doing all kinds of business with judgment and discretion; nor, on the other hand, to show that he was wholly deprived of reason so as to be incapable of doing the most familiar and trifling work. His deed would be void if
                            his mind and memory were in such a situation at the time of executing the deed as to render him wholly incompetent to judge his rights and interests in relation to that transaction. Lee v. Lee, 70 N.D. 79, 292 N.W. 124, 1940

                            Where elderly seller was confused about whom he was dealing with and buyer deceived seller about the nature of the transaction by obtaining seller’s signature on the contract for deed when other members of the family were not at home and without informing

                            This section is ample authority for the rescission of a former contract for mental incapacity, and the reference therein to the chapter on rescission was merely for the purpose of subjecting the rescission to the general rules governing the operation

                            Although appellants argued that the findings of lack of mental capacity were clearly erroneous, rescission of a contract on the ground of mental capacity was authorized by the statute, and the trial court found that there was evidence the decedent, who
                            suffered from moderate to severe neurological impairment, was incompetent to make decisions and thus was unable to comprehend the nature of the sale of his property, and thus there was evidentiary support for these findings.

                    to capacity is determined judicially. If actually restored to capacity, the person may make a will, though the person’s restoration is not determined judicially.

                            A man’s personal right to be free from defamation of character is not dependent upon the supposed cold necessities of business, so that to sacrifice rights of individual to supposed business necessity becomes controlling in the determining of human relations.

                            Grant of summary judgment in favor of a writer in a initiative drafter’s defamation action was appropriate because the drafter was at least a limited purpose public figure and he needed to present clear and convincing evidence that the writer’s statements
                            were false and made with actual malice, which he failed to do. It was therefore presumed that the evidence did not exist. Riemers v. Mahar, 2008 ND 95, 748 N.W.2d 714, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite>                            (N.D. 2008).

                            To defame a person is to speak evil of him maliciously and where words produce any perceptible injury to the reputation of another they are termed defamatory. Rickbeil v. Grafton Deaconess Hosp., 74 N.D. 525, 23 N.W.2d 247, 1946

                            Where nurses’ aide made comments in hospital which were breaches of confidentiality of both patient-specific and hospital-specific information, statement in personnel file that her employment was terminated for breach of confidentiality was not defamatory.
                            Eli v. Griggs County Hosp. &amp; Nursing Home, 385 N.W.2d 99, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1986).

                            Elected state attorney’s claim for defamation was dismissed on summary judgment evidence that the proffered defamatory statements were hearsay and not admissible, as there was no independent evidence of the statement’s trustworthiness. Myers v. Richland
                            County, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19944 (D.N.D. Sept. 30, 2004).

                            Where a former employee claimed that she was defamed by a letter of termination sent by the employer’s counsel to the employee’s attorney, which was sent after the employee’s attorney had made a settlement demand and threatened litigation, the letter
                            was absolutely privileged because it was a communication made preliminary to and related to a proposed or threatened judicial proceeding; in addition, defendants did not publish the letter to anyone other than the employee’s
                            attorney. Humann v. KEM Elec. Coop., Inc., 450 F. Supp. 2d 1006, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63537 (D.N.D. 2006), aff'd, 497 F.3d 810, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 19136 (8th Cir. N.D. 2007).

                        <p>
                            Where a former employee claimed that she was defamed when the employer’s attorney testified as a witness at the employee’s unemployment compensation hearing, there was no actionable defamation as a matter of law because an unemployment compensation hearing
                            conducted by Job Service North Dakota is a proceeding authorized by law and statements made by an attorney called as a witness at such proceedings are privileged under North Dakota law. Humann v. KEM Elec. Coop., Inc., 450
                            F. Supp. 2d 1006, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 63537 (D.N.D. 2006), aff'd, 497 F.3d 810, 2007 U.S. App. LEXIS 19136 (8th Cir. N.D. 2007).

                            Grant of summary judgment in favor of a writer in a initiative drafter’s defamation action was appropriate because the drafter was at least a limited purpose public figure and he needed to present clear and convincing evidence that the writer’s statements
                            were false and made with actual malice, which he failed to do. It was therefore presumed that the evidence did not exist. Riemers v. Mahar, 2008 ND 95, 748 N.W.2d 714, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite>                            (N.D. 2008).

                            To render words defamatory and actionable they need not make the defamatory charge in direct terms. Lauder v. Jones, 13 N.D. 525, 101 N.W. 907, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 1904).

                            If the language of an alleged libel is fairly susceptible of a construction rendering it defamatory and therefore actionable, though also susceptible of a contrary construction, the complaint states a cause of action, and it is for the jury to determine
                            whether the words were used in an innocent or defamatory sense. Lauder v. Jones, 13 N.D. 525, 101 N.W. 907, 1904 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 79</cite> (N.D. 1904); Meyerle v. Pioneer Publishing

                            If there is any doubt as to the meaning of a publication claimed to be libelous, so that extrinsic evidence is needed to determine whether it is of actionable character, or if the publication is reasonably susceptible of two constructions, the one innocent
                            and the other libelous, it is for the jury to determine which construction is the proper one. McCue v. Equity Coop. Publishing Co., 39 N.D. 190, 167 N.W. 225, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 23</cite>                            (N.D. 1918).

                            Generally, in cases involving the construction of pleadings, it is for the court to determine whether words are libelous per se. Ellsworth v. Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory, 69 N.D. 610, 289 N.W. 101, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite>                            (N.D. 1939).

                            Whether the alleged defamation is fairly warranted by the writing is a question of law for the court to decide; upon finding a reasonable possibility that the ascribed libelous meaning can be given to the material alleged to be defamatory, it is for the
                            jury to determine if the libelous meaning was intended or conveyed. Moritz v. Medical Arts Clinic, P. C., 315 N.W.2d 458, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 224</cite> (N.D. 1982).

                            In property owner’s action against township for civil libel over letters sent to local newspapers regarding the status of property owner’s lots, where the letters stated that the township board believed that the public should be given notice that the
                            property was subject to the township zoning ordinances and that a plat of the subject property was recorded without the consent of the township supervisors and advised that potential purchasers should review the zoning ordinances
                            and that building permits would be required, the truthful and innocuous language of the letters was not fairly susceptible of a defamatory meaning. Mr. G's Turtle Mt. Lodge, Inc. v. Roland Twp., 2002 ND 140, 651 N.W.2d 625,

                            Grant of summary judgment in favor of a writer in a initiative drafter’s defamation action was appropriate because the drafter was at least a limited purpose public figure and he needed to present clear and convincing evidence that the writer’s statements
                            were false and made with actual malice, which he failed to do. It was therefore presumed that the evidence did not exist. Riemers v. Mahar, 2008 ND 95, 748 N.W.2d 714, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite>                            (N.D. 2008).

                            a false and defamatory meaning; moreover, its alleged delay in responding was not reasonably and fairly susceptible of a defamatory meaning. Schmitt v. MeritCare Health Sys., Dakota Clinic, Ltd., 2013 ND 136, 834 N.W.2d 627,

                            Privilege is based upon the sound public policy that some communications are so socially important that the full and unrestricted exchange of information requires some latitude for mistake. It is well established that there is no liability for defamatory
                            statements that are privileged. Soentgen v. Quain &amp; Ramstad Clinic, P.C., 467 N.W.2d 73, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1991).

                            was absolutely privileged because it was a communication made preliminary to and related to a proposed or threatened judicial proceeding; in addition, defendants did not publish the letter to anyone other than the employee’s

                            Facts used to establish the elements of slander involved whether a wife made a false and unprivileged report of a defamatory matter to a third party, and this false report resulted in the husband being charged with a crime. The divorce court found these
                            facts in an earlier proceeding, because it found the wife falsely reported to law enforcement that the husband had sexually abused her, and this report resulted in the husband's criminal charges, and these facts found by the
                            divorce court also would have established the elements of defamation. Norberg v. Norberg, 2017 ND 14, 889 N.W.2d 889, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 2017).

                            Defendant’s statement that he had chosen not to renew the plaintiffs’ appointments “because other lawyers in the attorney general’s office has trouble working with them” did not impute to the plaintiffs general disqualifications in those respects which

                            Privilege is either absolute or qualified. Absolute privilege is limited to situations in which the free exchange of information is so important that even defamatory statements made with actual malice are privileged (see subdivisions (1) and (2) of this
                            section.) In contrast, a qualified privilege may be abused and does not provide absolute immunity from liability for defamation (see subdivisions (3) and (4) of this section.) Soentgen v. Quain &amp; Ramstad Clinic, P.C., 467

                            A qualified privilege is abused if statements are made with actual malice, without reasonable grounds for believing them to be true, and on a subject matter irrelevant to the common interest or duty. Soentgen v. Quain &amp; Ramstad Clinic, P.C., 467 N.W.2d
                            73, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1991).

                            Urologist’s statements to a deceased patient’s family regarding a surgeon’s treatment of the patient were properly ruled subject to a qualified privilege under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-02s14-02-05" target="_self">14-02-05</a></cite>(3).
                            The question of whether the urologist abused the qualified privilege by not following hospital procedures in communicating with the patient’s family was for the jury, which found in favor of the urologist. Khokha v. Shahin,

                            Where plaintiff in defamation action offered no evidence to support his proposition that defendants, who made defamatory statements to law enforcement during the investigation of criminal activity, were involved in “a pre-planned hoax” against him, reasonable
                            minds would not conclude that the qualified privilege of defendants for such communications was abused. Richmond v. Nodland, 552 N.W.2d 586, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D.

                            Summary judgment was properly granted to the reporter and the newspaper on the candidate’s suit alleging a defamatory statement where the alleged defamatory statement in the reporter’s article enjoyed a qualified privilege which was not abused because
                            the candidate failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact whether the statement was a fair and true report of a judicial proceeding and was made without malice, with reasonable belief in its truthfulness, and was based
                            on a subject matter relevant to the common interest. Riemers v. Grand Forks Herald, 2004 ND 192, 688 N.W.2d 167, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 322</cite> (N.D. 2004).

                            provide the public with competent physicians. Soentgen v. Quain &amp; Ramstad Clinic, P.C., 467 N.W.2d 73, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1991).

                            employers, two counties, were public records, and therefore so was the employee’s personnel file. The supervisor’s fulfillment of open records requests to potential employers of the employee was the exercise of an official

                            Where a former employee claimed that she was defamed by a letter of termination sent by the employer’s counsel to the employee’s attorney, which was sent after the employee’s attorney had made a settlement demand and threatened litigation, the letter
                            was absolutely privileged because it was a communication made preliminary to and related to a proposed or threatened judicial proceeding; in addition, defendants did not publish the letter to anyone other than the employee’s

                            District court properly concluded that a terminated employee’s defamation claim failed as a matter of law because the alleged defamatory statements were made in a letter that was privileged under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-02s14-02-05" target="_self">14-02-05</a></cite>.
                            The letter was privileged because it was sent by the attorney who represented the employee’s former employer and it responded to statements made by the employee’s lawyer, threatening legal action against the employer. Humann

                        emotional distress, were really disguised alienation of affection claims. Since such claims for civil relief were barred under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-02s14-02-06" target="_self">14-02-06</a></cite>,
                        the husband’s complaint could be dismissed because it failed to state a legally sufficient cause of action. Moseng v. Frey, 2012 ND 220, 822 N.W.2d 464, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 2012).

                        Evidence was sufficient to support verdict in favor of husband in his alienation of affections action against a married woman friend of his wife on claim that wife’s friend was the cause of wife’s abandonment of her husband and family, the destruction

                            In a civil action for libel, a trial court’s order sustaining a demurrer to a defense of a defendant television station held that this section is unconstitutional and void under sections 9, 11 and 22 of the state constitution of 1889, but the defendant
                            took no exception to the order and therefore the question as to the constitutionality of the section was not before the state supreme court on appeal. Farmers Educ. &amp; Coop. Union v. WDAY, Inc., 89 N.W.2d 102, 1958

                    No person may have more than one claim for relief for damages for libel or slander or invasion of privacy or any other tort founded upon any single publication or exhibition or utterance, such as any one edition of a newspaper or book or magazine or any
                    one presentation to an audience or any one broadcast over radio or television or any one exhibition of a motion picture. Recovery in any action must include all damages for any such tort suffered by the plaintiff in all jurisdictions.

                        Single publication rule, N.D.C.C. § 14-02-10, applied to a website containing alleged defamatory statements, and a new cause for defamation was not created by the modification of the site solely to update names and addresses of board members of plaintiff
                        nonprofit. That modification was neither material nor substantive enough to reach a new audience, and did not change the content that plaintiffs alleged was defamatory in nature. Atkinson v. McLaughlin, 462 F. Supp. 2d 1038, 2006

                            The former North Dakota Abortion Law violated the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution in that it excepted from criminality only abortions to save the life of the mother, without regard to the stage of pregnancy,

                            A quick fetus and a viable fetus are not the same, and only after a fetus becomes viable or potentially able to live outside the womb did the state have the right to regulate or proscribe abortion; the question of whether or not the fetus is, in fact,
                            viable should be left to the medical judgment of the physician. Leigh v. Olson, 385 F. Supp. 255, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11881 (D.N.D. 1974).

                            state interest for the regulation of abortion. Leigh v. Olson, 385 F. Supp. 255, 1974 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11881 (D.N.D. 1974).

                            the tradition of the state of North Dakota to protect every human life, whether unformed or aged, healthy or sick. Fargo Women's Health Org. v. Schafer, 18 F.3d 526, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 2141 (8th Cir. N.D. 1994).

                            It violated the Fourteen Amendment to make it a criminal offense to perform an abortion if a heartbeat had been detected, thereby banning most abortions beginning at approximately six weeks of pregnancy, because there was no evidence that a fetus could
                            live outside the womb at six weeks and thus be considered “viable”; the court granted a preliminary injunction against enforcement. MKB Mgmt. Corp. v. Burdick, 954 F. Supp. 2d 900, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 102620 (D.N.D. 2013).

                        status and age based upon proof of age offered by her. Before the period of pregnancy when the unborn child may reasonably be expected to have reached viability, an abortion may not be performed upon an unemancipated minor unless
                        the attending physician certifies in writing that each of the parents of the minor requesting the abortion has been provided by the physician in person with the information provided for in section 14-02.1-02 at least twenty-four

                        parents of the minor separately to the last-known addresses at least forty-eight hours prior to the minor’s consent to the performance of abortion. If a parent of the minor has died or rights and interests of that parent have been

                        the woman, before the abortion if possible, of the medical indications supporting the physician’s judgment that an abortion is necessary to avert her death or for which a twenty-four-hour delay will create grave peril of immediate

                    that interest, and why no reasonable less restrictive alternative exists. This section may not be construed to conceal the identity of the plaintiff or of witnesses from the defendant.

                            Plaintiffs made a sufficient showing of probable success on the merits of their claim that this section conflicted with Title X of the Public Health Service Act and Title V of the Social Security Act, insofar as it applied to encouragement and referral
                            of abortions, to entitle them to a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of this section in regards to encouragement and referral of abortions. Valley Family Planning v. North Dakota, 475 F. Supp. 100, 1979 U.S. Dist.

                            The restrictions of this section concerning abortion referrals were held to conflict with Title X of the Public Health Service Act, 42 USCS § 300, et seq.; therefore, this section was held invalid under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. Valley

                    It is the policy of this state to prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, the presence of any mental or physical disability, status with regard to marriage or public assistance, or participation in lawful
                    activity off the employer’s premises during nonworking hours which is not in direct conflict with the essential business-related interests of the employer; to prevent and eliminate discrimination in employment relations, public accommodations,
                    housing, state and local government services, and credit transactions; and to deter those who aid, abet, or induce discrimination or coerce others to discriminate.

                            When an important public policy would be frustrated by a promise, the policy outweighs enforcement of the promise. Moses v. Burleigh County, 438 N.W.2d 186, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            To permit a contractual term to vary the intent of a law against discrimination in commercial and contractual matters would make the law ineffective. If an employer could require waiver of an anti-discrimination law as a condition of employment, it could
                            become a widespread practice, increasing discrimination rather than doing away with it. It would be nearly impossible to enforce anti-discrimination laws in employment. Intrinsically, a law against discrimination outlaws contradictory
                            contracts. Moses v. Burleigh County, 438 N.W.2d 186, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            employee’s lawyer who responded to the employer’s offer to accept a non-supervisory position until her pension vested in exchange for waiving her ADEA claims against the employer, was not hired to oppose age discrimination
                            and informing the employer of the 21 day review provision under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act prior to a waiver of any ADEA claim was not, by itself, an act done to oppose age discrimination. Moreover, the employer
                            had a nondiscriminatory reason for firing the employee, namely, her inability to perform her managerial duties, which she failed to show was pretext for discrimination. Ambers v. Vill. Family Serv. Ctr., Inc., 329 F. Supp.

                            limited the major life activity of working but failed to offer evidence that proved that his claimed ADD substantially limited his ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs. His conclusory allegation

                            A sheriff’s deputy’s claim against defendant county for violation of the North Dakota Human Rights Act was dismissed because the employee failed to show he was disabled under N.D.C.C. § 14-02.4-02 where he alleged that Attention Deficit Disorder substantially
                            limited the major life activity of working but failed to offer evidence that proved that his claimed ADD substantially limited his ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs. His conclusory allegation
                            that he was substantially limited in the major life activity of working because he had some difficulties with billing was insufficient to withstand summary judgment. Shape v. Barnes County, 396 F. Supp. 2d 1067, 2005 U.S. Dist.

                            Where a worker unsuccessfully applied four times for a electrical system dispatcher position before his open heart surgery, his employer’s refusal to hire him for the position after the surgery was based on the worker’s lack of training and skill, and

                            Where plaintiff offered no proof of any age-conscious statements, writings, policies or discriminatory actions by defendants to or about or with reference to himself or anyone else, offered no statistical evidence from which any inference of age discrimination
                            might be drawn, pointed to no pattern of adverse treatment of older similarly situated employees, and his assertion of a prima facie case rested solely on the notion that he was replaced by a younger man, plaintiff failed to
                            offer any evidentiary showing which would support a jury finding of age discrimination, especially in the face of defendants’ plainly articulated legitimate business explanation that plaintiff was discharged because of his

                            When the employee provided sufficient evidence of age-discriminatory comments, discriminatory promotion practices, and the employer’s lack of legitimate business purpose for a company-wide reduction in force, but questions of fact remained regarding the
                            futility of applying for other positions within the company and the method of statistical analysis used to determine the disparate impact of the reduction in force, the employer had established a prima facie case of age discrimination
                            and the employer was therefore denied summary judgment. Krause v. Bobcat Co., 297 F. Supp. 2d 1212, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22989 (D.N.D. 2003).

                            Under this chapter, the plaintiff has the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination, which creates a presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the plaintiff. If the plaintiff
                            succeeds in establishing the presumption, then, under N.D.R.Ev. 301, the burden of persuasion shifts to the employer to rebut the presumption by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that its action was motivated by one
                            or more legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. If the employer fails to persuade the trier of fact that the challenged action was motivated by legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, the plaintiff prevails, but if the employer
                            persuades the fact finder that its reasons were nondiscriminatory, the employer prevails. Schweigert v. Provident Life Ins. Co., 503 N.W.2d 225, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D.

                            To permit a contractual term to vary the intent of a law against discrimination in commercial and contractual matters would make the law ineffective. If an employer could require waiver of an anti-discrimination law as a condition of employment, it could
                            become a widespread practice, increasing discrimination rather than doing away with it. It would be nearly impossible to enforce anti-discrimination laws in employment. Intrinsically, a law against discrimination outlaws contradictory

                            The mere assertion that one is overweight or obese is not alone adequate to make a claimant one of the class of persons afforded relief for discrimination; something more must be shown. The commonly understood meanings of disability and handicap may comprehend

                            weight, offered no expert evidence equating it to a disability or showing how it impaired her abilities, she failed to show a material issue of fact about being physically handicapped, and therefore, the trial court did not

                            rather, that the employee was terminated because the employee refused to be available for on-call responsibilities required for employees in the employee's position after the employer restructured the department in which the
                            employee worked. Yahna v. Altru Health Sys., 2015 ND 275, 871 N.W.2d 580, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 2015).

                            When a terminated employee had exhausted his administrative remedies, the district court erred in applying a de novo standard of review in an age-based discrimination case and in ignoring the findings of the Board of Higher Education; the procedure the
                            district court should have used was the standard applicable to appeals from administrative agencies. Ellis v. N.D.

                    If the department, as the result of an administrative hearing, or the court determines that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging in a discriminatory practice, the department or the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in the unlawful
                    practice and order temporary or permanent injunctions, equitable relief, and backpay limited to no more than two years from the date a minimally sufficient complaint was filed with the department or the court. Neither the department
                    nor an administrative hearing officer may order compensatory or punitive damages under this chapter. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person discriminated against reduce the backpay otherwise allowable.
                    In any action or proceeding under this chapter, the court may grant the prevailing party a reasonable attorney’s fee as part of the costs. If the court finds that the complainant’s allegation of a discriminatory practice is false and
                    not made in good faith, the court shall order the complainant to pay court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the respondent in responding to the allegation.

                    The department shall, during the period beginning with the filing of a complaint and ending with the filing of a charge or a dismissal by the department, to the extent feasible, engage in conciliation with respect to the complaint. A conciliation agreement
                    between a respondent and the complainant is subject to departmental approval. A conciliation agreement may provide for binding arbitration or another method of dispute resolution. Dispute resolution that results from a conciliation
                    agreement may authorize appropriate relief, including monetary relief.

                    Marriage is a personal relation arising out of a civil contract between one man and one woman to which the consent of the parties is essential. The marriage relation may be entered into, maintained, annulled, or dissolved only as provided by law. A spouse
                    refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.

                        Lack of adequate legal advice to a prospective spouse to obtain independent counsel is a significant factor in weighing the voluntariness of a premarital agreement, and adequate legal representation is often the best evidence a premarital agreement was
                        signed knowledgeably and voluntarily. Lutz v. Schneider (In re Estate of Lutz), 1997 ND 82, 563 N.W.2d 90, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D. 1997), dismissed, 1999 ND 121, 595 N.W.2d

                        Wife entered into a premarital agreement voluntarily where the attorney drafting the agreement told the wife that he was not representing her and that she should seek independent counsel to review the agreement and no fraudulent inducement to enter into
                        the agreement was found on the part of the deceased husband. Lutz v. Schneider (In re Estate of Lutz), 2000 ND 226, 620 N.W.2d 589, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 276</cite> (N.D. 2000).

                            The holding of a divorce hearing without the convict-husband being personally present because of his imprisonment did not constitute an abuse of the trial court’s discretion or violate any of convict-husband’s civil rights where his ability to give testimony
                            by deposition and to be represented by counsel was unimpaired by the trial court, and no convincing reasons for a personal appearance were brought forth. Shulze v. Shulze, 322 N.W.2d 250, 1982

                            Because marriage was dissolved by death and not by divorce, the trial court did not err when it held that there was no longer a marriage to be dissolved and, therefore, no issue of property distribution remaining before the court. Thorson v. Thorson,

                            Husband’s death, after an order for judgment was entered but before the judgment and decree of divorce was entered, abated the divorce action and N.D.R.Civ.P. 25(a)(3) did not create an exception to the general rule that the death of a party to a divorce
                            action, prior to the entry of a final decree, abated the action and left nothing for the district court to decide. Jochim v. Jochim, 2006 ND 186, 721 N.W.2d 25, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite>                            (N.D. 2006).

                            It was error to enter a divorce judgment distributing marital property because the wife's death before entry of a final judgment abated the divorce action, as a party's death destroyed the court's jurisdiction, since there was no marriage upon which the
                            decree could work, as the object of dissolving the marital relationship had been accomplished. Albrecht v. Albrecht, 2014 ND 221, 856 N.W.2d 755, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 221</cite>                            (N.D. 2014).

                            An action for annulment is predicated upon some ground existing at the time the marriage was entered into; an action for divorce is predicated upon grounds arising after the marriage, and the decree therein, in effect, declares the marriage valid and

                            The legislature has created the general subject matter for judicial divorce, and in this sense it is correct to say that jurisdiction in matters relating to divorce is wholly statutory; with relation to the statutory causes for divorce, such reference
                            to “jurisdiction” has reference only to the granting of divorces, and not to the matter of the jurisdiction of the district courts to “hear and determine” such causes of action. Schillerstrom v. Schillerstrom, 75 N.D. 667,

                <p>
                    The effect of a judgment decreeing a divorce is to restore the parties to the state of unmarried persons, but neither party to a divorce may marry except in accordance with the decree of the court granting the divorce. It is the duty of the court granting
                    a divorce to specify in the order for judgment whether either or both of the parties shall be permitted to marry, and if so, when. The court shall have jurisdiction to modify the decree of divorce at any time so as to permit one or
                    both of the parties to marry, if the court deems it right.

                            District court did not err in granting the wife a divorce on the grounds of adultery because the district court heard testimony about the husband’s affairs with other women, including one of lengthy duration and involving expensive gifts and out-of-state
                            travels; therefore, the evidence supported an adultery finding. Datz v. Dosch, 2013 ND 148, 836 N.W.2d 598, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 2013).

                            In an action for an absolute divorce on the grounds of extreme cruelty, the trial court is without power to decree a separation from bed and board or to make a division of property where the evidence is insufficient to establish grounds for divorce. Mattson

                            In an action for separation from bed and board, where plaintiff alleged extreme cruelty, the question of whether one party to the marriage has inflicted grievous mental suffering upon the other is one of fact to be determined from all the other circumstances

                            Because the parties are to be treated as unmarried, and may dispose of their property as they wish, when a trial court issues a decree of separation forever, it is permissible that a final division of property be made at that time, in accord with the

                            Considering the physical violence perpetrated against the wife by the husband and his illicit extramarital affairs, there was substantial evidence to support the trial court’s conclusion that extreme cruelty, consisting of both grievous bodily injury
                            and grievous mental suffering, was inflicted by the husband upon the wife during their marriage; the trial court’s underlying findings of extramarital conduct and physical abuse were supported by the evidence and were not clearly

                            Conduct on the part of either spouse which is unjustifiable, and which grievously wounded the mental feelings of the other so as to impair the other’s bodily health, or to cause destruction of the ends of marriage, constitutes extreme cruelty. Thompson

                            Defendant, who counterclaimed for divorce, proved a cause of action on the ground of extreme cruelty where the evidence showed that the defendant had married the plaintiff knowing that she had had previous relations with another man and that she was pregnant
                            and with child by such other man at the time of the marriage of defendant and plaintiff and thereafter defendant discovered that, for more than six months, the plaintiff was visited by the same other man in the home of defendant
                            and plaintiff. Kucera v. Kucera, 117 N.W.2d 810, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1962).

                    Condonation implies a condition subsequent that the forgiving party must be treated with conjugal kindness. When the cause of divorce consists of a course of offensive conduct, or arises in cases of cruelty from successive acts of ill treatment, which
                    aggregately may constitute the offense, cohabitation, or passive endurance, or conjugal kindness shall not be evidence of condonation of any of the acts constituting such cause, unless accompanied by an express agreement to condone.
                    In such cases, condonation can be made only after the cause of divorce has become complete as to the acts complained of. A fraudulent concealment by the condonee of facts constituting a different cause of divorce from the one condoned
                    and existing at the time of condonation avoids such condonation.

                    A divorce must be denied when there is an unreasonable lapse of time before the commencement of the action. Unreasonable lapse of time is such a delay in commencing the action as establishes the presumption that there has been connivance, collusion, or
                    condonation of the offense, or full acquiescence in the same, with intent to continue the marriage relation, notwithstanding the commission of the offense set up as a ground of divorce. The presumption arising from lapse of time may
                    be rebutted by showing reasonable grounds for the delay in commencing the action. There are no limitations of time for commencing actions for divorce, except such as are contained in this section.

                            A court need not have personal jurisdiction over both spouses to validly terminate the marital status if procedural due process has been met, and as long as the plaintiff satisfies the six-month residency requirement under this section, a court has jurisdiction
                            to change the parties’ marital status no matter where the defendant spouse resides. However, meeting the jurisdictional requirements to sever the marital status itself does not necessarily grant the court the authority to adjudicate
                            the related incidences of the marriage. Before adjudicating the incidences of the parties’ marriage, a trial court is required to obtain in personam jurisdiction over both spouses. Thus, a court must have personal jurisdiction
                            over a non-resident spouse in order to validly adjudicate matters of alimony or spousal support, the distribution or division of property and the award of child support. Smith v. Smith, 459 N.W.2d 785, 1990

                            Legal residence is a question of fact to be determined by the fact finder and to be reviewed according to the clearly erroneous standard of N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a).

                            A resident of another state cannot acquire a domicile in this state simply by coming within the state and remaining therein physically for the requisite statutory period. To his bodily presence within the state there must be added the present bona fide

                            The requirement in this section as to residence is not a jurisdictional prerequisite in the strict sense that it limits or restricts the jurisdiction of the district court to hear the case and determine all the issues in the action, including the question
                            of plaintiff’s residence. Schillerstrom v. Schillerstrom, 75 N.D. 667, 32 N.W.2d 106, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 1948).

                            This provision is not jurisdictional in strict sense that it limits jurisdiction of court to hear case and determine issues, including question of plaintiff’s residence; where trial court had divorce jurisdiction, and husband initiated action and wife
                            appeared generally by counsel, it had jurisdiction to try and determine action notwithstanding that husband might not have resided in state for twelve months next preceding commencement of action. Klaudt v. Klaudt, 156 N.W.2d

                            A court need not have personal jurisdiction over both spouses to validly terminate the marital status so long as the requirements of procedural due process are met; as long as the plaintiff satisfies the six-month residency requirement under this section,
                            prior to the entry of the decree, a court has subject matter jurisdiction to grant the divorce “no matter where” the defendant spouse resides. Byzewski v. Byzewski, 429 N.W.2d 394, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite>                            (N.D. 1988).

                            A non-Indian divorce plaintiff’s compliance with the six-month residency requirement of this section, is not necessarily determinative of a district court’s subject matter jurisdiction over such matters as child custody and support where the custodial
                            domicile has at all pertinent times been on the reservation. Byzewski v. Byzewski, 429 N.W.2d 394, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                            Where the parties were married and lived together on the reservation with the children up until the time of separation, the district court’s exercise of jurisdiction over child custody and support in the non-Indian spouse’s divorce action infringed on
                            the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them. Byzewski v. Byzewski, 429 N.W.2d 394, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                            Where wife, a resident of Pennsylvania, had no connection to North Dakota other than the fact that her husband moved to and became a resident of North Dakota, her contacts with North Dakota were insufficient to justify exercise of jurisdiction to adjudicate
                            incidences of marriage. North Dakota court had jurisdiction only to dissolve marriage, not to adjudicate alimony, child support, division of marital property or child custody. Smith v. Smith, 459 N.W.2d 785, 1990

                    <p>
                        In action granting divorce to wife on the ground of irreconcilable differences rather than to husband on the ground of wife’s adultery, in view of the uncontradicted evidence at trial that husband was not the father of wife’s expected child, it would
                        have been appropriate for the trial court to make a provision in the judgment, pursuant to this section, that the child was not the husband’s, in order to avoid any problems with future claims against the husband for child support.

                            The trial court did not abuse its discretion in assessing a large portion of the costs and fees to the father, considering the financial circumstances of the parties and the court’s finding that the father was responsible for unreasonably increasing the

                            District court went beyond the scope of a former wife’s contempt motions in amending a divorce judgment because its modification of the judgment as a part of its contempt order failed to comport with due process; although neither party moved to amend
                            the divorce judgment, the district court amended, rather than clarified, the judgment, and the hearing notice and hearing itself involved the parties’ competing motions for contempt sanctions. Rath v. Rath, 2014 ND 171, 852

                            District court judgment restricting father’s visitation with his two minor children to one supervised 30-minute visitation with the children each month, providing, however, that the supervising social worker could enlarge the visitation in duration and
                            frequency if it was in the children’s best interests to do so, would be affirmed where father failed to submit a transcript, and thus did not meet his burden of demonstrating that the trial court’s findings of fact were clearly
                            erroneous or that the trial court otherwise committed reversible error. Lithun v. Du Paul, 447 N.W.2d 297, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court’s findings and giving due regard to the trial court’s superior opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses, the wife failed to overcome the presumption of correctness the appellate

                            Where the father had moved out of state, and where the child was approximately six years old, the trial court’s award to the father of up to seven consecutive days of visitation with the child in the fall and spring of each school year, restricted to
                            the city where the mother resided or at the place of the father’s residence, and visitation for the father once each month in the city of the mother’s residence, was not clearly erroneous where the trial court set forth its
                            written explanation that it was in the best interest of the child to be very specific about visitation because of the poor communication between the parents. T.E.J. v. T.S., 2004 ND 120, 681 N.W.2d 444, 2004

                            District court did not err in finding there was no material change in circumstances and in denying the father’s motion to modify parenting time; the child’s increased age and development were anticipated by the district court when the prior judgment was
                            entered, and the the child’s current age and developmental needs were not a material change in circumstances, plus any argument about the possibility of future changes to the father’s employment negatively impacting parenting

                            entry of either the original or amended parenting plan; the district court contemplated the children reaching school age and how the amended parenting plan would impact their school attendance and participation in extracurricular
                            activities; and, in its order denying the parties’ motions for reconsideration, the district court stated that the complicating factor of school time would be an issue the parties would have to work through going forward. Rustad

                            The trial court’s consideration of a request to modify a custody award requires a determination of whether or not there has been a significant change of circumstances since the original custody award which warrants a change of custody in the best interest

                            District court judgment modifying an original custody decree by changing custody of the parties’ minor daughter from mother to father would be reversed, and remanded where the trial court failed to address the issue of whether there had been a significant
                            change of circumstances since the original custody decree was entered. However, pending a new hearing and redetermination by the trial court, custody would remain with father. Anderson v. Anderson, 448 N.W.2d 181, 1989

                            Finding of the district court that the high level of conflict between the parties was a change in circumstances, along with the father’s having presented no evidence that visitation upon request would be in the best interest of the children, demonstrated
                            that the district court was not clearly erroneous in denying visitation upon request. Hanson v. Hanson, 2005 ND 82, 695 N.W.2d 205, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2005).

                            Trial court had erred as a matter of law when it held that a husband’s long period of unsupervised child visitation and the wife’s recent decision to deny unsupervised visitation, had not constituted a material change in circumstances since the original
                            decree, necessitating the trial court to conduct a best interest analysis. Simburger v. Simburger, 2005 ND 139, 701 N.W.2d 880, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2005).

                            District court properly modified parenting time based on a material change in circumstances because both parties had remarried, the mother had moved, the original parenting provisions were not working in the children's best interests, and there was no
                            evidence that the father consumed alcohol to excess or was violent with the children while exercising his parenting time. Schurmann v. Schurmann, 2016 ND 69, 877 N.W.2d 20, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite>                            (N.D. 2016).

                            District court properly denied a father’s motion to amend the parties’ parenting time schedule because the limited amount of unsupervised parenting time exercised by the father was insufficient to support a finding that the best interests of the children
                            would be met if the modification were granted. Rath v. Rath, 2018 ND 98, 909 N.W.2d 666, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 97</cite> (N.D. 2018).

                            District court’s finding of a material change sufficient to support modification of parenting time was supported by the record and not clearly erroneous; the district court found that the mother had frustrated the father’s visitation and attempted to
                            hinder his relationship with the child. Green v. Swiers, 2018 ND 258, 920 N.W.2d 471, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 261</cite> (N.D. 2018).

                            Where there is domestic violence leading up to an order, a new act of domestic violence following the order arguably would not be a material “change” in circumstances; the new act might be considered a continuation of the same circumstance that led to
                            the original order. O'Hara v. Schneider, 2017 ND 53, 890 N.W.2d 831, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 2017).

                            Where the initial order included consideration of domestic violence, a new domestic violence act by the same parent satisfies the “material change” prong as a matter of law; in such an instance, the district court must consider all relevant evidence of
                            domestic violence, regardless of whether the original order was based on a stipulated agreement. O'Hara v. Schneider, 2017 ND 53, 890 N.W.2d 831, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D.

                            When a district court issues its original order establishing residential responsibility or parenting time, the order necessarily implies that the parenting plan was tailored to end the domestic violence; the order does not erase prior domestic violence
                            acts by prohibiting a district court from considering those acts, and further domestic violence after the initial order is always a material change in circumstances. O'Hara v. Schneider, 2017 ND 53, 890 N.W.2d 831, 2017

                            Court erred in ruling the mother was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing for failing to establish a prima facie case for modification, because the mother did not move to modify primary residential responsibility, but rather, she moved to modify parenting

                            The objectives and procedures used in a writ of habeas corpus, unless substantially modified, are unrealistic and inappropriate for determining the custody of a child, especially because of changed circumstances where the best interests of the child are
                            involved; the better procedure for litigant seeking custody of a child because of changed circumstances is to initiate an action or proceeding stating the facts and the nature of the matter and the remedial relief sought, or
                            by a motion if the parties are the same as those in the divorce decree or judgment, and requesting an evidentiary hearing whenever the evidence is in dispute. Mansukhani v. Pailing, 300 N.W.2d 847, 1980

                            When the trial court is making an original award of custody between parents in a divorce proceeding, it must determine the single issue of what is in the child’s best interest. However, when the trial court considers a request to modify an original custody
                            award, it must determine two issues: (1) whether or not there has been a significant change of circumstances since the original divorce decree and custody award; and, if so, (2) whether the changed circumstances are such that
                            the best interest of the child would be served by a custody modification. Anderson v. Anderson, 448 N.W.2d 181, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            the paramount concern in awarding visitation to a nonparent being the best interests of the child. Quirk v. Swanson, 368 N.W.2d 557, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 327</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                            N.D.C.C. § 14-17-14 does not enlarge the basic provision of this section to extend visitation to anyone. The authority for awarding visitation to a non-parent emanates from the North Dakota supreme court’s previous decisions concerning child custody and
                            visitation. Quirk v. Swanson, 368 N.W.2d 557, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 327</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                            Stipulations concerning property division and child custody entered into by parties to a divorce action are governed by the law of contracts, which requires that the parties have capacity to contract; party was entitled to have portion of default divorce
                            judgment which incorporated stipulations concerning property division and child custody vacated where, due to alcoholism, there were many doubts as to the party’s capacity to contract at the time the stipulations were executed.

                            Where trial court accepted parties’ stipulation as to the amount of child support in a proceeding to modify the child support obligation, it was error for trial court to add to the stipulation by increasing the amount of support without first giving notice
                            to the parties. Aaker v. Aaker, 338 N.W.2d 645, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 348</cite> (N.D. 1983).

                            Plaintiff misled the court into conducting a contract analysis, instead of simply construing and applying the divorce decree. When a stipulation is incorporated into a divorce judgment, the court is concerned only with interpretation and enforcement of

                            The test for awarding custody is the best interest of the child, and not fitness of the parents, or fairness to the parents. Odegard v. Odegard, 259 N.W.2d 484, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 213</cite> (N.D. 1977);

                            Child custody determination in original divorce proceeding resolves solely around the concept of the child’s best interest; where a modification of the original custody award is sought, trial court’s determination must focus on whether or not there has
                            been a significant change of circumstances since the original divorce decree and custody award and, if so, whether or not those changed circumstances are such that the best interests of the child would be served by a change

                            Court erred in its child visitation decision because there was no finding that visitations between the mother and her son would necessarily endanger the child’s physical or emotional health. Consequently, the trial court impermissibly delegated its authority,

                            Evidence supported the trial court’s determination that the father willfully and deliberately interfered with the mother’s visitation rights through his delay tactics, failure to cooperate, and refusal to in any way facilitate visitation between his children
                            and their mother because (1) the trial court did not find credible the father’s assertion that his failure to facilitate visitation between the children and the mother was due to his reliance on the language of the divorce
                            decree; (2) during the course of what the parties had agreed would be a 10-day visit, the mother ended up receiving only about 24 total hours with the children, and the father claimed at the hearing that this was not his responsibility;
                            and (3) the father’s profession of his concern for his children’s welfare was tarnished by his statement at the church that the mother could take the children by force if she wanted to. Also, the trial court’s finding that
                            visitation was not likely to endanger the children’s physical or emotional health was not clearly erroneous; therefore, the trial court did not err in modifying the child custody and visitation award. Sisk v. Sisk, 2006 ND

                            was improperly denied where a district court failed to make sufficient findings regarding how the father’s past alcohol and domestic abuse problems would have resulted in physical or emotional harm to the child; there were
                            no evaluations from independent professionals regarding the harm, and the termination of visitation was merely based on surmise and conjecture. Wilson v.

                            time with the children; further, having already made sufficient findings to award the mother primary residential responsibility, the district court was not required to make separate findings to justify its liberal parenting-time

                            It is customary practice to provide extended summer visitation when children are old enough; therefore, where parent requested such visitation it was error for the trial court, without explanation, to deny the request when it determined visitation. Dschaak

                            Trial court did not err in granting the father extended summer visitation, finding that the father’s former behavior of prescription drug abuse posed no threat to the well being of the children, he had not abandoned his children, that the mother’s allegations
                            of domestic violence were insufficient as a matter of law, and that oversees travel to visit the father would be educational and safe for the children. Schiff v. Schiff, 2000 ND 113, 611 N.W.2d 191, 2000

                            Trial court’s seven week set summer visitation schedule with non-custodial father in North Dakota was not clearly erroneous given that the children lived with their mother in Georgia, the schedule permitted father time to form relationships with his children,
                            and the set dates decreased the chance that parties would disagree over the visit. Georgia. Tibor v. Tibor, 2001 ND 43, 623 N.W.2d 12, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 2001).

                            in denying mother’s motion for a new hearing and motion to amend judgment with respect to the court’s mandate of two years’ supervised visitation, the court did not clearly err in finding no material change of circumstances
                            warranting modification of the visitation order where the record showed that the mother received counseling treatment but nothing more and she alleged her children were lying to their professional counselors, but did not call

                            District court did not make specific findings regarding the child’s best interests, but its findings were sufficient to show its basis for amending the parenting plan; the court’s amendment on extended summer visitation was not clearly erroneous. Horsted

                            It was error to modify a father's parenting time because (1) due process required adequate notice and a fair opportunity to be heard, (2) the only matter before the trial court was the father's contempt motion, (3) no party moved to amend the divorce

                            District court did not err in denying a father's motion to modify parenting time because the father did not submit the necessary evidence to the district court; the district court's finding that the father's word was not legally sufficient went to his
                            credibility and was consistent with the district court's previous findings. Rath v. Rath, 2016 ND 46, 876 N.W.2d 474, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite> (N.D. 2016).

                            District court erred in entering a third amended judgment modifying the father's parenting time while he was incarcerated as the district court failed to make sufficient findings of fact in the third amended judgment because the district court made no
                            findings as to whether a material change in circumstances occurred, whether suspended visitation was necessary as visitation was likely to endanger the children, and whether modification of the second amended judgment was necessary
                            to serve the best interests of the children; and the district court failed to make findings stating why supervised parenting time by a professional was necessary to protect the children's physical or emotional health. Curtiss

                            time because, while the father's new employment benefitted him personally, it did not constitute a material change in circumstances in the context of whether he endangered his child's physical or emotional health; there was
                            a protection order still in place; and the father did not present admissible evidence that he was working with any specific counselor to address any remaining anger issues. Schaffner v. Schaffner, 2017 ND 170, 898 N.W.2d 428,

                            Absent a showing of emotional or physical harm to the children, court will not impose upon the noncustodial parent the affirmative obligation of policing during visitation periods the religious instructions of the custodial parent; to justify the placement
                            of religious restrictions on visitation rights, the physical or emotional harm to the child resulting from the conflicting religious instructions or practices cannot be simply assumed or surmised, but must be demonstrated in
                            detail. Hanson v. Hanson, 404 N.W.2d 460, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 298</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                            Where the evidence fell short of the clear and affirmative showing of physical or emotional harm to the children required to justify religious restrictions, the trial court’s order prohibiting the noncustodial father from taking the children during visitation
                            periods to any church other than the Catholic Church was clearly erroneous. Hanson v. Hanson, 404 N.W.2d 460, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 298</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                            Denying or severely restricting the right to visitation upon a mere showing of probable cause (except, perhaps, temporarily prior to a hearing) would not comport with the traditional function of a probable cause determination. Curtailing visitation on
                            such a slight showing would be detrimental to the interests affected because of the increased risk of error and the long-term consequences. Accordingly, the argument that probable cause is the appropriate standard of proof
                            to adjudicate restrictions on visitation is rejected. Healy v. Healy, 397 N.W.2d 71, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 460</cite> (N.D. 1986).

                            Trial court’s visitation order was not clearly erroneous because it reduced father’s weekly visitation with children during the school term; in addition to reducing his weekly visitation, the trial court granted father an extended summer visitation of
                            four weeks and left in place his two weekday-evening visits per week when the children were not in school. The actual difference in father’s yearly visitation time under the amended judgment was negligible and not a “restriction.”

                            Sufficient evidence supported a trial court’s decision to suspend a father’s visitation under subsection (2) of this section, based on a finding that visitation would be harmful to the child’s physical and emotional health, where the father engaged in
                            sexual behavior in the child’s presence, made inappropriate comments about the child’s body, and pressured the child to recant her statements about his conduct. Litoff v. Pinter, 2003 ND 172, 670 N.W.2d 860, 2003

                            detailed findings demonstrating the physical or emotional harm to the child likely to result from visitation. Further, the district court erred in eliminating the ex-wife’s duty to inform him of any changes in residential phone

                            the trial court found the father was not involved in the improper activities, there was evidence of the conduct of a person in his home and the father’s failure to protect the children, plus he did not believe them, which had
                            an adverse impact on the children, plus the trial court found that the children suffered harm by the inappropriate photographs and touching by the daughter, and the father’s denial of the conduct compounded that harm; there
                            was evidence to support these findings, which were sufficiently specific to understand the basis for the decision to order supervised visitation outside of the presence of the fiancee and daughter, and thus the order was not

                            those visits sometimes upset her, continuing supervised visitation at the penitentiary was not likely to endanger the younger child's physical or emotional health; however, a counselor or therapist or other neutral individual

                            Denying or severely restricting the right to visitation upon a mere showing of probable cause (except, perhaps, temporarily prior to a hearing) would not comport with the traditional function of a probable cause determination. Curtailing visitation on
                            such a slight showing would be detrimental to the interests affected because of the increased risk of error and the long-term consequences. Accordingly, the argument that probable cause is the appropriate standard of proof
                            to adjudicate restrictions on visitation is rejected. Healy v. Healy, 397 N.W.2d 71, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 460</cite> (N.D. 1986).

                            Court did not err in granting a father unsupervised child visitation where the court was unpersuaded by a psychologist’s testimony because her interview of the child took place several years after the father’s alleged indecent exposure incident involving
                            the then three-year-old child and because the psychologist had indicated that three-year-olds had difficulty separating reality from fantasy. Furthermore, there were unresolved questions as to the validity, setting, and circumstances
                            as to both the statement and drawings produced by the child regarding the alleged incident and testimony by the mother regarding the child’s repetition of the story was unpersuasive. Fast v. Mayer, 2005 ND 37, 692 N.W.2d 138,

                    During any time in which an action for separation or divorce is pending, the court, upon application of a party, may issue an order requiring a party to pay such support as may be necessary for the support of a party and minor children of the parties
                    and for the payment of attorney’s fees. The court in the order may make an order concerning parental rights and responsibilities concerning the children of the parties. The order may be issued and served in accordance with the North
                    Dakota Rules of Court. The court may include in the order a provision for domestic violence protection provided the party has submitted a verified application for the order which is sufficient to meet the criteria defined in subsection

                            If the wife has ample means of her own to present her cause of action or defense to the court, it would be an abuse of discretion to require the husband to make an allowance. Bailey v. Bailey, 22 N.D. 553, 134 N.W. 747, 1912
                            <cite

                            Where husband is in possession of the property of the parties, he should be required to pay temporary alimony, suit money, and attorneys’ fees, notwithstanding that the wife might be able to raise money by mortgaging her property. Matthiesen v. Matthiesen,
                            55 N.D. 471, 214 N.W. 460, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 1927).

                            A debt incurred by the wife for medical expenses cannot be made the basis of a payment required to be made as temporary alimony where the debt was incurred several months prior to her application and its payment is not necessary for her support. Hodous

                            The main considerations in making an allowance for support money are the needs of one party and the ability of the other to pay. Heller v. Heller, 81 N.W.2d 124, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 1957);

                            The necessity of suit money is usually ascertained as of the time of the commencement of the action, and not as of the time of the appeal from a judgment, lest the party with few assets be denied representation at the most critical stages of the suit.

                            In determining what portion of attorney fees should be paid by the opposing party, trial court should consider the property owned by each party as a result of the property division; their relative incomes; whether the property is in liquid or fixed assets;
                            and whether or not the actions of the parties unreasonably increased the time spent on the case. Nastrom v. Nastrom, 284 N.W.2d 576, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 304</cite> (N.D. 1979).

                            business was struggling, she had assumed the burden of paying off the business debt, she worked for little or no pay, and she was no longer receiving spousal support, the trial court’s findings properly indicated that she had
                            a need for attorney fees under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-23" target="_self">14-05-23</a></cite>. Lee v. Lee, 2005 ND 129, 699 N.W.2d 842, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite>                            (N.D. 2005).

                            Trial court abused its discretion in partially vacating the parties’ original divorce judgment by suspending child support payments, awarding the wife temporary rehabilitative child support, and failing to provide an explanation or findings to support

                            The supreme court has jurisdiction to consider an application for temporary alimony, counsel fees, and suit money after the district court has lost jurisdiction but the application should be made in district court if there is reasonable opportunity to
                            do so before appeal. Mosher v. Mosher, 16 N.D. 269, 113 N.W. 99, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 54</cite> (N.D. 1907).

                            Although the trial court and the Supreme Court have concurrent jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees on appeal it is preferable that the trial court determine the amount of attorney’s fees for a spouse on a divorce appeal. Roen v. Roen, 438 N.W.2d 170,

                            would therefore remand case to the trial court for an award of attorney’s fees to wife for appeal. Martin v. Martin, 450 N.W.2d 768, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1990).

                            Although Supreme Court generally prefers trial court to make the initial determination of attorney fees because it is not an evidence gathering body, Supreme Court will grant where party requested minimal fees, and given the need for conserving judicial
                            resources as well as those of the litigants. Fenske v. Fenske, 542 N.W.2d 98, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            Although the appeals court has concurrent jurisdiction to award attorney fees, the trial court should determine whether to award attorney fees because the trial court is in a better position to assess relevant factors. Shaver v. Kopp, 545 N.W.2d 170,

                            Usually the parties’ financial situations will remain unchanged until after the appeal is decided. Accordingly, a spouse in need of temporary support before trial will in all likelihood be in need of temporary support during pendency of an appeal. If
                            extraordinary circumstances exist which indicate that the parties’ financial situations have changed, the trial court can make provisions in the judgment or in a post-judgment order altering or terminating the temporary support

                            Amount and duration of spousal support was proper where monthly award did not exceed wife’s monthly expenses, the amount was well within husband’s ability to pay, and wife had limited potential for future employment. Orgaard v. Orgaard, 1997 ND 34, 559

                            Where, in a marriage of long duration there was a significant disparity in the parties’ earning abilities, there was not enough total present or anticipated income for each spouse to maintain separately the standard of living that they enjoyed together,
                            while the amount of spousal support awarded may, perhaps, have been generous in light of the parties’ needs and ability to pay, it was not clearly erroneous. LaVoi v. LaVoi, 505 N.W.2d 384, 1993

                            In determining the amount of attorney fees to be paid by the opposing party, the trial court should consider the property owned by each party as a result of the property division, the relative incomes, whether the property is liquid or of fixed assets,
                            and whether or not the actions of the parties unreasonably increased the time spent on the case. The case was remanded for a determination of reasonable attorney’s fees in accordance with all applicable criteria. Nastrom v.

                            Where the parties’ abilities to pay attorney fees were relatively equal, wife’s request for payment of fees was denied. LaVoi v. LaVoi, 505 N.W.2d 384, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 162</cite> (N.D. 1993).

                            In request by wife for attorney fees, husband’s larger pension income was offset by the small amount of other assets he received under the judgment and the time he spent responding to issues that wife should have raised in her post-trial motion; wife
                            also received nearly $ 10,000 more than husband in bank accounts and therefore, each party should pay their own attorney fees. Steckler v. Steckler, 519 N.W.2d 23, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 150</cite>                            (N.D. 1994).

                            Given the disparity in the property distribution which greatly favored the wife, the wife’s needs, and the husband’s ability to pay, in light of the husband’s needs and the husband’s child support and spousal support obligations, the trial court did not
                            abuse its discretion in failing to award the wife attorney fees. Reineke v. Reineke, 2003 ND 167, 670 N.W.2d 841, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to order the husband to pay the wife’s attorney’s fees and costs; the principle factors for consideration in awarding attorney’s fees in a divorce action were the parties’ needs and abilities to pay.

                            In an action in which the former husband appealed from an order denying his motion to modify his stipulated spousal support obligation under a divorce judgment and the former wife cross-appealed from that part of the order denying her request for an award
                            of attorney fees and costs incurred in resisting the motion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the wife’s request for attorney fees and costs where (1) the wife’s gross monthly revenues of $ 8,730 until
                            October 1, 2006, when it would drop to a monthly gross income of $ 7,880, nicely covered her ample monthly expenses of $ 6,758; and (2) the husband’s gross income was found to be sufficient to pay child support and spousal
                            support to the wife and to cover his ample monthly expenses, but it was not so much in excess of his expenses that he could afford to pay the wife’s attorney fees. Rothberg v. Rothberg, 2007 ND 24, 727 N.W.2d 771, 2007

                            Court misapplied the law in deciding not to award wife attorney’s fees because the court failed to balance the parties’ needs and abilities to pay, instead noting that wife had commenced the divorce action merely because the parties “just didn’t get along
                            any more.” Wagner v. Wagner, 2007 ND 101, 733 N.W.2d 593, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 2007).

                            was frivolous. Lee v. Lee, 2007 ND 147, 738 N.W.2d 479, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 2007).

                            District court properly ordered the parties to pay their own attorney fees because both parties were at fault through their conduct for the high fees, the wife was awarded more liquid assets and a cash distribution, and the husband could not afford to
                            pay her attorney fees in view of his other obligations under the divorce judgment. Evenson v. Evenson, 2007 ND 194, 742 N.W.2d 829, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 202</cite> (N.D. 2007).

                            Court did not abuse its discretion in denying wife in a divorce proceeding award of attorney’s fees where wife failed to provide evidence as to what work her attorney had done, and she only stated how much she owed her attorney. Waldie v. Waldie, 2008

                            Because the trial court ordered the wife to receive liquid assets and spousal support, it appeared that she had the ability to pay the attorney fees and therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering that both the husband and the
                            wife each pay their own attorney fees. Solem v. Solem, 2008 ND 211, 757 N.W.2d 748, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 234</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            Court erred in denying attorney fees, because the mother testified she did not have the ability to pay her attorney fees, the court found the father had the ability to pay his attorney fees, and the court provided no explanation for the denial, leaving
                            the reviewing court to speculate whether factors were properly considered and the law was properly applied. Deyle v. Deyle, 2012 ND 248, 825 N.W.2d 245, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite>                            (N.D. 2012).

                            Although seemingly inadequate for three days of trial and time spent in preparation, award of three hundred dollars for attorney fees was not so grossly inadequate as to constitute an abuse of discretion. Halla v. Halla, 200 N.W.2d 271, 1972

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing wife attorney’s fees in the amount of $ 150 for trial and $ 450 for appeal where husband’s appeal was unsuccessful and where, under trial court order, husband’s income after divorce was to exceed wife’s
                            by only $ 50 a month and neither of their incomes could reasonably be expected to exceed $ 400 per month. Johnson v. Johnson, 211 N.W.2d 759, 1973 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D.

                            There was no abuse of discretion by trial court in awarding attorney fees to wife where wife had limited earning power and, in the property division, the husband received income-producing property while the wife received virtually all fixed assets. Gooselaw

                            Where husband’s attorney’s fees were paid in a divorce action to an unknown extent from earnings of husband’s professional corporation, this reduced the value of the corporation for purposes of the property division. The trial court thus correctly determined
                            that wife indirectly paid for part of husband’s attorney’s fees, and demonstrated a proper exercise of its discretion in awarding wife a portion of her attorney’s and expert witness’ fees. Bagan v. Bagan, 382 N.W.2d 645, 1986

                            District court did not abuse its discretion in its award of attorney fees where: (i) it found that an award of $3,000 to the ex-wife for attorney fees was appropriate, (ii) it considered the parties’ financial situations, finding that any award of attorney
                            fees would be a burden to both, (iii) it also considered the parties’ respective fault in escalating fees to justify its award based on additional proceedings necessitated by the ex-husband, including the ex-wife’s motion for
                            entry of a judgment by default, the ex-husband’s initial challenge to the court’s jurisdiction, in addition to the proceedings for the prior restraining order and a motion to compel discovery, and (iv) it found that the $3,000
                            amount did not represent all of the ex-wife’s increased costs but the court was mindful of the ex-husband’s ability to pay. Keita v. Keita, 2012 ND 234, 823 N.W.2d 726, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite>                            (N.D. 2012).

                            did not allow the review of those positions because the district court erred by failing to make specific findings in its award. Therefore, the supreme court remanded for a reevaluation of the evidence on the record and ordered

                            District court did not abuse its discretion in denying a wife’s motion to reopen the record and for other relief and did not abuse its discretion in awarding the husband attorney’s fees because it found that the wife’s motion was merely an inappropriate
                            attempt to continue the trial; the district court explained its decision and awarded the husband’s attorney’s fees, which it deducted from the wife’s property distribution because her motion was inappropriate, unfounded and
                            without merit. Rhodenbaugh v. Rhodenbaugh, 2019 ND 109, 925 N.W.2d 742, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 2019).

                            of the prenuptial agreement, and they had sufficient financial means to bear their own attorney fees. Tschider v. Tschider, 2019 ND 112, 926 N.W.2d 126, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite>                            (N.D. 2019).

                            Wife’s attorney’s fees award did not err because a husband was properly sanctioned for unnecessarily increasing time spent on the case by obstructing discovery, moving to vacate and amend findings without new evidence, and moving to amend an order appointing
                            a parenting investigator, although the award could be reconsidered given reversal of a property distribution. Lizakowski v. Lizakowski, 2019 ND 177, 930 N.W.2d 609, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite>                            (N.D. 2019).

                            Where trial court order required husband to make monthly lump sum temporary child support payments to his wife, fact that one of the minor children moved from the home of the wife into the husband’s home subsequent to such temporary support order did
                            not entitle the husband, in the absence of modification of such order by the trial court, to independently on his own reduce the amount of temporary child support paid to his wife. Klitzke v. Klitzke, 308 N.W.2d 385, 1981

                            The statute authorizes a division of property between the parties only if a divorce is granted. Hoellinger v. Hoellinger, 38 N.D. 636, 166 N.W. 519, 1918 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 1918); Orwick v. Orwick,

                            The power of a court to decree a property settlement is derived from the statute and not from written agreement and stipulation of the parties. Agrest v.

                            Because marriage was dissolved by death and not by divorce, the trial court did not err when it held that there was no longer a marriage to be dissolved and, therefore, no issue of property distribution remaining before the court. Thorson v. Thorson,

                            In discerning whether an amount paid by one spouse to the other is a property division or spousal support, several factors must be considered. Factors which may indicate that the payments are distributions of property include: payments that do not terminate
                            after the obligee dies payments that continue even after obligee remarries excluding the payments in controversy, a large disparity in the property divided which is otherwise unexplained, payments that do not terminate on the
                            obligor’s death. In addition, security for payment may tend to indicate property distribution since deferred-property payments are dischargeable in bankruptcy, unlike spousal-support payments. Redlin v. Redlin, 436 N.W.2d 5,

                            Where wife appealed divorce decree and husband moved for dismissal of appeal on ground that wife had accepted substantial benefits under judgment, court held that wife’s acceptance of property which had been given with husband’s consent and acceptance
                            of child support payments did not preclude her from bringing the appeal. Piper v. Piper, 234 N.W.2d 621, 1975 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1975).

                            Payments made pursuant to court order by husband on real estate mortgage on the home occupied by the wife did not constitute a voluntary acceptance of benefits by the wife under the divorce judgment so as to preclude her right to appeal that judgment,
                            nor did the sale by the wife of a small portion of personal property, including property awarded her under the judgment as well as other property of which the ownership was in dispute, estop her from appealing. Nastrom v. Nastrom,

                            Party who objects to an appeal of alimony or property division issues on the basis of waiver of right to appeal due to acceptance of benefits under the decree has the burden of proving that the accepting party was not entitled to the accepted benefits
                            except by the decree. Hoge v. Hoge, 281 N.W.2d 557, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 188</cite>, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1979).

                            Wife accepted substantial benefits under the divorce judgment and, therefore, waived her right to appeal the property division where the only property awarded to her by the divorce decree which was not her separate property was a mobile home which was
                            held jointly by wife and husband; wife took affirmative steps to transfer title of the mobile home to her name pending the appeal; there was nothing to indicate that wife would not have been able to live in the mobile home
                            pending appeal without having title transferred to her name; and wife would not, in view of the parties’ circumstances and agreements, have been entitled to the mobile home but for the divorce decree. Geier v. Geier, 332 N.W.2d

                            Where wife transferred title to homestead to her name, transferred rights to bar and liquor license, and divided remaining items of property of substantial value, wife accepted substantial benefits under divorce judgment; therefore, wife waived her right

                            Because of the unique status of a divorce judgment which divides property that is often jointly owned or at least has been jointly enjoyed during the marriage, joint or individual possession of an asset during the pendency of a divorce action does not
                            constitute acceptance of a benefit. Spooner v. Spooner, 471 N.W.2d 487, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 102</cite> (N.D. 1991).

                            Husband’s motion to dismiss an appeal from a property distribution and spousal support award was denied because the husband did not clearly establish that the wife waived the right to appeal by accepting the benefits of the divorce judgment; the husband
                            did not argue that the wife was entitled to less property or support. Sommers v. Sommers, 2003 ND 77, 660 N.W.2d 586, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                            for release of husband’s obligation, in the event of sale, the court’s action on wife’s petition in ordering the continuation of payments of principal and interest (but not taxes and insurance) following wife’s sale of the

                            Where the only explanation given by the trial court for the substantial disparity in property division between the parties was that it credited gifts from the wife’s family, the award was clearly erroneous. Gaulrapp v. Gaulrapp, 510 N.W.2d 620, 1994

                            Although the trial court did not make an exact equal division of the property, the court adequately explained why it awarded husband about $ 4,500 more property than wife; the marriage was of relatively short duration, and the court found husband brought
                            considerably more property into the marriage than wife; at the time of the hearing wife was earning more than husband, furthermore, husband was 43 years old while wife was only 27 years old, so wife had both greater income
                            and presumably more years to accumulate an estate. Schmidkunz v. Schmidkunz, 529 N.W.2d 857, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 1995).

                            The district court did not adequately explain its reasoning for the substantial disparity in the distribution of assets by noting that the proportional incomes made by each of the parties in the last four years of the marriage were the percentages used
                            in dividing the property. Linrud v. Linrud, 552 N.W.2d 342, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            Where marriage was of relatively short duration, and husband brought considerable assets into the marriage while wife began the marriage with a negative net worth, the trial court’s property division awarding wife only fourteen percent of the marital
                            estate was not clearly erroneous. Wetzel v. Wetzel, 1999 ND 29, 589 N.W.2d 889, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 31</cite> (N.D. 1999).

                            Property division was not clearly erroneous where trial court awarded wife a greater percentage of the property in order to correct a disparity between the parties and where the Ruff-Fischer guidelines and the trial court’s explanation were adequate to
                            understand the basis for the property distribution. Corbett v. Corbett, 2001 ND 113, 628 N.W.2d 312, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2001).

                            him to pay to the wife an equalization payment; the district court adequately explained the disparity in the distribution. Willprecht v. Willprecht, 2020 ND 77, 941 N.W.2d 556, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite>                            (N.D. 2020).

                            of ownership nor the title to property dictated distribution of an item of property to the spouse who acquired it during the marriage. The disparity in the value of property distributed was not so great that the division of

                            Where the husband brought a substantial amount of real estate to the marriage, but the wife made substantial direct and indirect contributions to the husband’s real estate investment and management activities, a nearly equal division of the real property
                            was not an abuse of discretion. Peterson v. Peterson, 1999 ND 191, 600 N.W.2d 851, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 1999).

                            Former husband was unable to appeal a divorce judgment that divided the marital property by adopting the findings of a prior separation judgment because there was nothing to indicate that the award, which awarded the wife 50 percent of a retirement account
                            and valued the marital property, was temporary. Cannaday v. Cannaday, 2003 ND 58, 659 N.W.2d 363, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                            District court did not err by setting the value of a residence at $ 175,000 where the evidence showed that the house was listed for sale at that price, but later reduced slightly, and a realtor testified that the house could have sold for between $ 160,000
                            and $ 170,000. Moreover, the district court did not err by finding that payments made by one spouse’s parent were a gift, rather than a loan, and retirement benefits were subject to division. Marquette v. Marquette, 2006 ND

                            Property valuation was not clearly erroneous and the trial court did not err as a matter of law in deciding the husband was entitled to a greater share of the marital estate, because the district court was presented with conflicting evidence that gave
                            a range for the property valuations, and after calculating the entire marital estate, the district court, in considering the Ruff-Fischer factor regarding the origin of property found the husband entered the marriage with nearly
                            twice as much in assets as the wife. Hitz v. Hitz, 2008 ND 58, 746 N.W.2d 732, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            In a divorce case, the district court’s property distribution of the marital estate was not clearly erroneous because the evidence supported the district court’s findings that the long-term duration of the parties’ marriage and the husband’s dissipation
                            of marital assets favored an equal division of the marital estate. Ulsaker v. C. True Bright White, 2009 ND 18, 760 N.W.2d 82, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 2</cite> (N.D. 2009).

                            because the husband was competent and understood the settlement agreement when he signed it; he also failed to show that the agreement was unconscionable. The wife testified that the husband had not consumed any alcohol for
                            three days and he was coherent and not impaired when he signed the agreement. Vann v. Vann, 2009 ND 118, 767 N.W.2d 855, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 2009).

                            Court properly awarded a wife less than 50 percent of the marital estate because, although the parties were separated for more than 17 years, the court found the “marriage was a long-term marriage” and the court considered the wife’s retention of the
                            proceeds from the sale of the home and the husband’s depletion of marital assets. Kosobud v. Kosobud, 2012 ND 122, 817 N.W.2d 384, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 2012).

                            court’s decision to grant tax exemptions and a cash property distribution to the ex-wife; there was evidence to support the district court’s findings, and the court was not left with a definite and firm conviction the district

                            In parties’ divorce action, the trial court properly divided the parties’ property except for two small items that were to be remanded for correction, because it provided findings after consideration of the Ruff-Fischer factors that supported its reasoning,
                            and credibility and valuation determinations were more properly within its province than within the court’s review on appeal. Holte v. Holte, 2013 ND 174, 837 N.W.2d 894, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite>                            (N.D. 2013).

                            District court considered the speculative and potentially volatile value of an inherited remainder interest in farmland as well as the parties' lack of liquidity in reaching its decision not to equally divide the interest between the parties; although
                            a substantial disparity existed between the property awarded, the district court sufficiently explained its reasoning for distributing the property as it did, including the fact that the value of the land could change over
                            time, and the distribution was not clearly erroneous. McCarthy v. McCarthy, 2014 ND 234, 856 N.W.2d 762, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            District court made findings related to the parties' incomes, expenses and assets, and because the marriage was approximately five years long and the wife brought few assets to the marriage, the court's property division was not clearly erroneous. Degnan

                            District court's property division was not clearly erroneous because, while the wife received a lesser percentage of the parties' farm property and equipment in the distribution than the husband, the wife was awarded all of the parties' current income-producing
                            rental property, zero debt, and a substantial majority of their liquid assets. Furthermore, the district court sufficiently explained its reasoning for distributing the property as it did. Langwald v. Langwald, 2016 ND 81,

                            District court's distribution was not clearly erroneous because the district court adequately explained its disparity in distributing the parties' marital property, and there was evidence in the record to support its findings; in its analysis, the district
                            court essentially provided alternate rationales for deciding that the unequal distribution of assets was in fact equitable. Rebel v. Rebel, 2016 ND 144, 882 N.W.2d 256, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite>                            (N.D. 2016).

                            District court did not err in its distribution of marital property, as the property division resulted in a nearly equal net distribution between the parties; the concerns the district court expressed about the husband’s limitations on his earning capability
                            related more to his contributions to the marriage than to the type of work he was doing, and the rationale for the district court's decision could be determined based on the findings and the record. Lizakowski v. Lizakowski,

                            Distribution of marital property and debt was not clearly erroneous where the marital estate had a negative net worth, and the court made detailed findings about each Ruff-Fischer factor and attempted to return each party to their premarital state by
                            reimbursing the wife for medical expenses incurred on behalf of the couple's child. Allmon v. Allmon, 2017 ND 122, 894 N.W.2d 869, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2017).

                            District court's distribution of marital property was affirmed where the pretrial conference transcript was not included in the record, making it impossible to determine whether the district court relied on an improper presumption in distributing farmland,
                            and the district court had explained its unequal distribution at great length and considered the relevant Ruff-Fischer factors in making its determination. Brew v. Brew, 2017 ND 242, 903 N.W.2d 72, 2017

                            District court properly divided the parties’ marital estate and awarded the wife spousal support because the district court determined the value of the marital estate and made specific findings based on the required factors and explained the reason for
                            the disparity in the property division and, while the court did not explicitly quantify the wife’s need for spousal support or the husband’s ability to pay, it considered their monthly expenses and the property division amounts,
                            he was awarded more of the marital property, had a higher earning ability, and he was not left in an impossible financial situation. Berg v. Berg, 2018 ND 79, 908 N.W.2d 705, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite>                            (N.D. 2018).

                            Property distribution was not clearly erroneous because the district court explained its distribution and found the distribution was equitable as the district court did not include the value of the college savings accounts in evaluating whether the distribution
                            was equitable as the children were the beneficiaries of those accounts; and the remaining property was almost equally distributed. Lessard v. Johnson, 2019 ND 301, 936 N.W.2d 528, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 307</cite>                            (N.D. 2019).

                            Although the wife argued that the district court erred in not relying on her domestic violence protection order against the husband, case law did not establish how heavily the district court was to weigh the order in fault determinations under the guidelines,
                            and in this case, the court was not left with a definite and firm conviction a mistake was made by the district court in its distribution of the marital estate. Swanson v. Swanson, 2019 ND 25, 921 N.W.2d 666, 2019

                            It was no error not to include certain livestock in a marital estate because the livestock was acquired after marital property was valued as of the date of separation, after which both parties acquired property not included. Wald v. Wald, 2020 ND 174,

                            Wife did not provide structured argument or case law to support her contention that a criminal conviction resulted in the destruction, squandering or waste of assets, and the district court did not err in refusing to find that the husband committed economic
                            fault based solely on his prior conviction. Swanson v. Swanson, 2019 ND 25, 921 N.W.2d 666, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 4</cite> (N.D. 2019).

                            District court’s property distribution erred because the court wrongly found the parties’ marriage was short-term by excluding the parties’ pre-marital cohabitation, and, on that basis, wrongly excluded a wife’s premarital asset, which was presumptively
                            included in the marital estate. Lizakowski v. Lizakowski, 2019 ND 177, 930 N.W.2d 609, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 180</cite> (N.D. 2019).

                            This section does not require that there be an equal division of property, but that there be an equitable division of property. Haugeberg v. Haugeberg, 258 N.W.2d 657, 1977 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 201</cite> (N.D.

                            The objective of a property division is to make an equitable distribution of the parties’ property. Wastvedt v. Wastvedt, 371 N.W.2d 142, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 357</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                            There is no requirement that the property distribution in a divorce case be equal in order to be equitable. However, a particular case may present circumstances wherein an equal division of the marital property may be proper. Volk v. Volk, 376 N.W.2d
                            16, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 417</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                        <p>
                            The ultimate objective of this section is to make an equitable division of the property. There are no set rules for the distribution of the marital estate, and what is equitable depends upon the circumstances of the particular case. Blowers v. Blowers,
                            377 N.W.2d 127, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 433</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                        <p>
                            It is within the discretion of the trial court, after hearing the testimony and applying the Ruff-Fischer guidelines, to determine an equitable distribution of the property in each individual case. A property division need not be equal to be equitable.
                            Similarly, there is no rule that the trial court equally divide any increase in the net worth of the parties which occurred during the marriage. Routledge v. Routledge, 377 N.W.2d 542, 1985

                        <p>
                            An equitable distribution of the real and personal property of the parties need not be equal to be equitable; the determination of what constitutes an equitable distribution lies within the discretion of the district court and is dependent upon the facts
                            and circumstances of each case; however, when a substantial inequality in the property division exists, that disparity must be explained. Volk v. Volk, 404 N.W.2d 495, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 290</cite>                            (N.D. 1987).

                        <p>
                            While the trial court is required to make an equitable distribution of property, there is no requirement that the property distribution must be equal in order to be equitable. Fleck v. Fleck, 427 N.W.2d 355, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite>                            (N.D. 1988).

                        <p>
                            There is no requirement that property be divided equally in order to be divided equitably, but when a substantial inequality in the property division exists, that disparity must be explained. Bader v. Bader, 448 N.W.2d 187, 1989

                            A property division need not be equal to be equitable, but a substantial disparity should be explained. Heggen v. Heggen, 452 N.W.2d 96, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 1990).

                            The trial court is required to make an equitable distribution of the parties’ real and personal property; there are not fixed rules by which a trial court must equitably divide the marital estate, and the determination of what is an equitable division
                            is left within the discretion of the trial court, which is in a much better position to ascertain the true facts by listening to and observing the demeanor of the witnesses. Culver v. Culver, 497 N.W.2d 431, 1993 N.D. App.

                            The trial court’s division of property does not have to be equal in order to be equitable. Schmidkunz v. Schmidkunz, 529 N.W.2d 857, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 45</cite> (N.D. 1995).

                            In reviewing a property division on appeal, the court starts with the view that marital property should be equally divided and, while the division need not be exactly equal to be equitable, the trial court must explain any substantial disparity. Therefore,
                            nearly equal property division was not clearly erroneous. Gregg v. Gregg, 1998 ND 204, 586 N.W.2d 312, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 209</cite> (N.D. 1998).

                        <p>
                            District court did not err in dividing the parties’ marital property in half where it was not an inequitable distribution; under the guidelines, a substantially disparate asset and debt allocation in the wife’s favor was not justified or equitable and
                            the wife’s personal injury settlement proceeds received during the marriage were part of the marital estate. Bladow v. Bladow, 2003 ND 123, 665 N.W.2d 724, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite>                            (N.D. 2003).

                        <p>
                            Court’s property distribution was inequitable because, by awarding the property to who “brought it along,” a substantial disparity of approximately four million dollars was created that was not adequately explained; that large financial disparity was
                            aggravated by the court’s failure to make a finding as to the total value of the marital estate. Ulsaker v. White, 2006 ND 133, 717 N.W.2d 567, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D.

                        <p>
                            There was no error in distributing marital property under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-24" target="_self">14-05-24</a></cite>(1) because findings were made on each of the applicable factors when a
                            husband was awarded substantially more than a wife where the court found that a substantial amount of the marital estate was acquired before the marriage, and an equal distribution would have been inequitable because it would
                            have destroyed the husband’s ability to earn a living on a farm. Dvorak v. Dvorak, 2006 ND 171, 719 N.W.2d 362, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 2006).

                        <p>
                            District court did not adequately articulate reasons that justified a greater disparity in favor of the husband, and the wife received property that worth less than the value ascribed to it, and thus the court could not determine if the distribution was
                            equitable and the court remanded. Rebel v. Rebel, 2013 ND 116, 833 N.W.2d 442, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite> (N.D. 2013).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            District court’s property distribution was clearly erroneous because the ex-wife received a net property award of approximately $163,500 and the ex-husband received the remainder of the property and debt, for a net award of approximately $1,422,500, which
                            resulted in an award to the husband of approximately 90% of the marital estate, including all the parties’ real property and all the assets related to the farming operation; and, although the importance of preserving the viability
                            of a family farming operation had been recognized, it should not result in a windfall for one spouse. Further, the district court could not retain jurisdiction to modify a final property distribution even to ensure the distribution
                            remained equitable. Gerving v. Gerving, 2020 ND 116, 943 N.W.2d 797, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 2020).

                            The distribution to be made depends upon the facts and circumstances and, among the “circumstances” which are logically relevant and material upon the issue of “equitable distribution”, are those concerning the condition, needs, and conduct of the parties,
                            and the amount of property owned by them, its nature, and the time and manner of its acquisition. Agrest v. Agrest, 75 N.D. 318, 27 N.W.2d 697, 1947 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D.

                        <p>
                            In determining division of property between parties in divorce action, court, in exercising discretion, will consider respective ages of parties, their earning ability, duration of marriage, conduct of each during marriage, their station in life, circumstances
                            and necessities of each, their health and physical condition, their financial circumstances as shown by property owned at the time, its value at that time, its income-producing capacity, if any, and whether accumulated or acquired
                            before or after the marriage, and such other matters as may be material; this rule does not require that division be equal in order to be equitable; awarding three quarter-sections of property acquired by parties during marriage,
                            as well as one-half of personal property, to husband was not an abuse of discretion even though divorce was awarded to wife under circumstances, including husband’s poor health and questionable earnings potential. Rohde v.

                            health and physical condition; their financial circumstances as shown by the property owned at the time, its value at that time, its income-producing capacity, and whether accumulated before or after marriage; and such other

                            Conduct of the parties is only one factor among a number of others to be considered by the trial court when dividing property in a divorce action; conduct is not necessarily the sole or controlling factor and the guidelines for making a property division
                            do not require the division be based on the conduct of the parties, but require the trial court to consider conduct in making the property division. Rust v. Rust, 321 N.W.2d 504, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 294</cite>                            (N.D. 1982).

                            325 N.W.2d 245, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 354</cite> (N.D. 1982).

                        <p>
                            The trial court has sufficient flexibility to consider the source of the property as one factor in arriving at an equitable distribution. However, separate property, whether inherited or otherwise, must initially be included in the marital estate and
                            is subject to distribution as may be necessary to achieve an equitable distribution. Anderson v. Anderson, 368 N.W.2d 566, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 329</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                            In arriving at an equitable property distribution in a divorce case, the trial court may consider the respective ages of the parties to the marriage; their earning abilities; the duration of the marriage and the conduct of each during the marriage; their
                            station in life; the circumstances and necessities of each; their health and physical condition; their financial circumstances, as shown by the property owned at the time; the property’s value and its income-producing capacity,
                            if any, and whether it was accumulated or acquired before or after the marriage; and such other matters as may be material. Volk v. Volk, 376 N.W.2d 16, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 417</cite>                            (N.D. 1985).

                            Consideration of the divorcing parties’ earning abilities is one of the guidelines which are utilized when considering either the equitable distribution of property or the award of spousal support. Opoien v. Opoien, 425 N.W.2d 373, 1988

                            A homemaker’s contribution deserves equivalent recognition in a property distribution upon dissolution of a marriage. Behm v. Behm, 427 N.W.2d 332, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                            Circumstances of inheritance, gift, or premarital acquisition are factors to be considered, but are not rules of law which prevent equitable distribution of marital property. Fleck v. Fleck, 427 N.W.2d 355, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite>                            (N.D. 1988).

                            Fault may be a relevant factor in property division. No distinction need be drawn between economic fault and noneconomic fault. Bader v. Bader, 448 N.W.2d 187, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 223</cite> (N.D. 1989); Davis

                            Without a determination of serious marital misconduct or economic waste by one spouse, the court cannot direct substitution of an unbalanced division to the other spouse of property acquired during a long-term marriage. Martin v. Martin, 450 N.W.2d 768,

                            While alimony may sometimes be used as part of a property division, periodic cash payments without interest awarded as part of a property distribution must be discounted to present value in determining whether or not the distribution is equitable. Lucy

                            Where court granted a money judgment to be paid to husband as a part of the equitable distribution of marital property, allowing wife eight years to pay $ 9,000 was no error, considering wife’s income and her expenses for maintaining a home and raising
                            four children. Hendrickson v. Hendrickson, 553 N.W.2d 215, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 215</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            Trial court’s distribution of marital assets upheld where trial court clearly followed guidelines set forth in Ruff-Fischer; specifically, the court considered husband’s economic and noneconomic misconduct and husband’s greater earning potential, and
                            properly granted wife property in lieu of spousal support. Mellum v. Mellum, 2000 ND 47, 607 N.W.2d 580, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 52</cite> (N.D. 2000).

                            Trial court did not err in its division of the marital property where the court appropriately considered the abuse of the husband towards the wife, and correctly applied a pre-marital agreement which excluded most property from the marriage including
                            the husband’s retirement account but correctly recognized that the increase in the value of the account should be included in the marital estate given that it was largely due to the wife’s paying the majority of the household
                            expenses that the husband was able to make significant contributions to his retirement account. Reiser v. Reiser, 2001 ND 6, 621 N.W.2d 348, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 2001).

                            Despite only a three-year marriage, a trial court did not err by awarding a wife periodic payments from a husband in order to have a more equal division of marital property; the wife was not awarded spousal support, the wife was disadvantaged by the marriage
                            because of an inability to find similar employment, the wife had health problems, and the husband attempted to convey marital assets in order to reduce the marital estate. Horner v. Horner, 2004 ND 165, 686 N.W.2d 131, 2004

                            Equal division of the parties’ property in a divorce action was upheld where the trial court properly considered the ages of the parties, their earning ability, the conduct of the parties during the marriage, and their station in life. Although the wife
                            asserted that the court needed to place greater emphasis on her needs arising out of her medical condition, her history, and her poor outlook for the future, the court evaluated the wife’s needs with regard to those issues,
                            the record reflected that the wife had an educational background in business management and work experience in bookkeeping and the court also found that while she was presently receiving social security disability income, there
                            was no evidence of a permanent award. Donlin v. Donlin, 2007 ND 5, 725 N.W.2d 905, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 2007).

                            Property distribution fashioned by a trial court in a divorce action was not clearly erroneous where the trial court properly applied the Ruff-Fischer guidelines, resulting in a roughly equal distribution of the marital property, as required by N.D.C.C.
                            § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-24" target="_self">14-05-24</a></cite>(1); the trial court carefully explained that the award was not exactly equal due to the husband’s noncompliance

                            Trial court’s division of marital property in a divorce action was not clearly erroneous under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-24" target="_self">14-05-24</a></cite>(1) because the trial court did not
                            base its property distribution solely on the wife’s premarital ownership of the property; the trial court made specific findings under the Ruff-Fischer guidelines and found that three of them favored an unequal division of
                            property in favor of the wife. Overland v. Overland, 2008 ND 6, 744 N.W.2d 67, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            Where the parties were married for approximately 17 years and, during their marriage, had three children and shared their marital assets, the record supported the trial court’s decision to distribute one-half of the marital assets to each spouse. Dronen

                            In a divorce case, a district court's property distribution under this statute was not clearly erroneous because the guidelines were considered; a former wife was compensated for household chores done after she quit her job, she was able to find other
                            employment, her conduct caused the demise of the marriage, and the marriage was short in duration. Fugere v. Fugere, 2015 ND 174, 865 N.W.2d 407, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 183</cite>                            (N.D. 2015).

                            Where trial court did not consider or fully evaluate all the property of the parties in making a property division, the evidence in support of the property division was insufficient and the parties were entitled to a new trial on that issue. Hoge v. Hoge,

                            Property division and alimony award were set aside on appeal where trial court made no finding of net worth of the marital assets and it could not be determined if the amount of alimony awarded the wife was in the nature of spousal support or part of
                            the property division. Urlaub v. Urlaub, 325 N.W.2d 234, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 351</cite> (N.D. 1982).

                            Portion of divorce judgment concerning distribution of property was reversed, where the trial court did not determine the net value of some of the property and did not specify the rationale for its distribution so as to enable a determination of the basis
                            of distribution by deduction or reasonable inference. Graves v. Graves, 340 N.W.2d 903, 1983 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 422</cite> (N.D. 1983).

                            Trial court’s second amended judgment in divorce case would be remanded for a more specific indication of the factual basis for the district court’s conclusion that there was no other way to divide farm property, short of ordering that the property be
                            sold, in light of supreme court’s expressed preference that courts should avoid a property distribution which will destroy or damage the ability of one of the parties to earn a livelihood, and the district court’s finding that
                            farming was the only trade that husband knew. Pankow v. Pankow, 371 N.W.2d 153, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 360</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                            To determine whether or not a property division is clearly erroneous, the reviewing court needs to understand the trial court’s rationale for its decision. Although the trial court need not make an express finding as to each of the guidelines in Fischer
                            v. Fischer, 139 N.W.2d 845 (N.D. 1966), and Ruff v. Ruff (1952) 78 N.D. 775, 52 N.W.2d 107, appellate review is significantly aided when findings of fact are prepared which clearly disclose the basis of the trial court’s decision.

                            There is no absolute requirement upon trial court to set forth in its findings the value of each individual item making up the net worth of the parties; to the extent the record reflects the trial court heard evidence as to the value of each asset and
                            liability, and applied the accounting equation of assets minus liabilities equals total equity in determining the parties’ net worth, the division of property will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. Nastrom v. Nastrom,

                            Where evidence has been admitted from which the trial court can determine the net worth of the parties’ real and personal property, the court must make such determination before making an equitable distribution of the property; failure to make such determination
                            is an abuse of discretion. Williams v. Williams, 302 N.W.2d 754, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 1981).

                            of the marital estate and were subject to equitable distribution. Murphy v. Rossow, 2010 ND 162, 787 N.W.2d 746, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 2010).

                            In determining whether there has been a material change in circumstances to warrant modification of a spousal support obligation, the court must examine the extent to which the changes were contemplated at the time of the original decree. Schaff v. Schaff,

                            Where the marital estate involved ongoing business activities in which marital assets were regularly converted into other marital assets or to a reduction of marital debt, the mere fact that an asset had been in some way converted to another form did

                            Although preserving the viability of business operations, such as farms, is an important consideration, the goal of preserving a business does not call for a windfall for one spouse; rather, the district court may structure the property division to allow

                            Distribution of farm assets to one spouse with an offsetting monetary award to the other generally allows successful operation of the farming enterprise as an economic unit without working a disadvantage to either spouse and avoids the conflict likely

                            The Supreme Court has never decreed that the property brought into a marriage by a party be irrevocably set aside to that party. Rather, premarital acquisition is only one of several factors to be considered. Freed v. Freed, 454 N.W.2d 516, 1990

                            The trial court must consider all of the real and personal property accumulated by the parties as part of the marital estate, regardless of the source. Freed v. Freed, 454 N.W.2d 516, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite>                            (N.D. 1990).

                            The idea that property acquired prior to the marriage by one spouse should be irrevocably set aside to that spouse was particularly inappropriate where the “pre-marital assets” had been commingled over a 17-year marriage, and no longer had any separate
                            identity, and the trial court should not have excluded pre-marital property from the value of the distributable marital estate. Heley v. Heley, 506 N.W.2d 715, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite>                            (N.D. 1993).

                            When spouses live together for a time, have children together, and then marry, the trial court may properly consider all of their time together, and is not confined to dividing only the specific values saved during the marriage. Braun v. Braun, 532 N.W.2d

                            retirement fund as marital property was correct; husband’s retirement fund had no conditions or uncertainties unlike wife’s social security, and since husband’s retirement fund was earned during the marriage, it was equitable
                            for the trial court to take it into account in dispersing marital property. Olson v. Olson, 445 N.W.2d 1, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            motion to redistribute property and request for hearing was untimely because it was not filed within 60 days of the notice of entry of the order, and thus, the supreme court did not have jurisdiction to review the order and

                            Spouse, though self-supporting, was disadvantaged by divorce and in need of rehabilitative support, where marriage was of a long term, during most of which she deferred pursuit of her career and cared for parties’ children and home, and other spouse admitted

                            District court did not misapply the statute because the parties agreed to the same valuations for most of the assets in the marital estate, and for the assets the parties were unable to agree on, the district court determined the value of the property

                            In valuing a husband’s tax business for purposes of making a property division, the trial court erred in failing to distinguish the entrepreneurial skill or potential future earnings of the husband, which is not a property interest subject to division,

                            It was not clearly erroneous for the trial court, in making a property division, to give greater weight to wife’s valuation of assets and to husband’s valuation of debts.

                            Interest payments improperly inflated value of basic distribution. Kitzmann v. Kitzmann, 459 N.W.2d 789, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1990).

                            Where trial court intended to award wife “nearly one-half” of the net marital estate, apparently demonstrating its belief that the property division should be nearly equal in order to be equitable, but wife’s final share of the marital property was substantially
                            less due to inclusion of interest and erroneous mortgage calculation, case was remanded to the trial court for further findings. Kitzmann v. Kitzmann, 459 N.W.2d 789, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite>                            (N.D. 1990).

                            While interest may be used to avoid discounting deferred payments to present value, it cannot be used to increase the amount of the basic distribution to determine if that distribution is equitable at the outset. Kitzmann v. Kitzmann, 459 N.W.2d 789,

                            Supreme court will not recognize that interest, required to be paid in order to avoid the inequitable distribution that would arise from a present-value distribution to one spouse and deferred distribution to the other spouse, may be considered as part
                            of the basic distribution to determine whether or not that distribution is equitable. To do so is to disadvantage the payee, i.e., the interest would be considered not only for the purpose of compensation for delay in receipt
                            of the share of the marital estate, but also to increase the amount of the basic distribution to determine whether or not that distribution is equitable in the first instance. Kitzmann v. Kitzmann, 459 N.W.2d 789, 1990

                            When interest is awarded on a cash property distribution by periodic payments, the dollar value of the interest paid should not be included when calculating the value of the property distributed to each spouse. Sateren v. Sateren, 488 N.W.2d 631, 1992

                            When one party receives property which is clearly worth less than the value ascribed to it by the trial court, a reviewing court cannot determine whether the resulting property distribution is equitable. Therefore, it is necessary to discount periodic
                            payments to present value. Sateren v. Sateren, 488 N.W.2d 631, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1992).

                            It is not usually wrong for a trial court to accept the valuations submitted by one spouse over the other’s, or to weigh one spouse’s value testimony more heavily.

                            Trial court’s valuation of each parties’ interest in farmstead was clearly erroneous, where, in dividing the marital estate, the trial court awarded each party an undivided one half interest in farmstead, as tenants in common, and assigned equal values
                            to their interests, but gave the wife the right to receive all rents and profits from it unless and until she decided to live off of the farmstead or not to operate the farm; the trial court carved out a significant part of
                            husband’s tenancy interest, without making any corresponding adjustment in the value of that interest. Volson v. Volson, 542 N.W.2d 754, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            An award of alimony upon divorce is a method of rehabilitating the party disadvantaged by the divorce, not a continuation of the right of one spouse to be supported by the other during marriage; therefore, the constitutionality of this section does not
                            depend upon the constitutionality of statutes defining the obligation of support, and though they may be unconstitutional because discriminatory on the basis of sex, this section, which makes no distinction on that basis, is
                            not. Bingert v. Bingert, 247 N.W.2d 464, 1976 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 1976).

                            Trial court properly reduced a former husband’s spousal support obligation because (1) the court found the husband’s income had been significantly reduced, causing the husband to be unable to provide support in the amount previously ordered, after considering
                            the husband’s past and current income and earning ability, each party’s circumstances and necessities, and the former wife’s health and physical condition, and (2) the former wife did not show she could not work to support

                            It was no error to terminate a husband’s spousal support obligation based on a wife’s cohabitation because (1) the parties’ spousal support agreement after the statute’s amendment did not explicitly state support would not terminate upon the wife’s cohabitation,
                            and (2) nothing showed the support was rehabilitative. Markegard v. Willoughby, 2019 ND 170, 930 N.W.2d 108, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite> (N.D. 2019).

                            It was not an abuse of discretion not to terminate spousal support as of the filing of a husband’s motion to terminate because support was statutorily terminated “upon an order of the court” finding a wife’s habitual cohabitation for at least one year.

                            District court properly divided the parties’ marital estate and awarded the wife spousal support because the district court determined the value of the marital estate and made specific findings based on the required factors and explained the reason for
                            the disparity in the property division and, while the court did not explicitly quantify the wife’s need for spousal support or the husband’s ability to pay, it considered their monthly expenses and the property division amounts,
                            he was awarded more of the marital property, had a higher earning ability, and he was not left in an impossible financial situation. Berg v. Berg, 2018 ND 79, 908 N.W.2d 705, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite>                            (N.D. 2018).

                            District court’s award of spousal support was reversed where although it made findings on the parties’ ages, health, occupations, and incomes, as well as the long-term nature of the marriage, it did not make findings on the parties’ financial circumstances,
                            including the wife’s need for, and the husband’s ability to pay, spousal support. Instead, the court appeared to have simply combined the amount of support proposed by the husband with the duration suggested by the wife. Tarver

                            District court properly awarded rehabilitative spousal support to the wife for 10 years because the parties had a long-term marriage, the wife was in need of spousal support, the husband had the ability to pay, and the award would allow the wife sufficient

                            could, under the interpretation of the judgment, have constituted a change in circumstances for the interrelated spousal support, the trial court could also reconsider the husband’s spousal support obligation. Lee v. Lee, 2005

                            There is no legal requirement that a support obligor obtain prior court approval before changing employment; because a change in employment does not necessarily result in a change in financial circumstances, the proper time for a court to determine whether

                            Contrary to the husband's argument, the district court properly concluded that N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-24.1" target="_self">14-05-24.1</a></cite>(3) did not apply to cohabitation that occurred
                            prior to August 1, 2015, and as a result, any cohabitation the wife may have engaged in prior to that date did not count toward the requirement for terminating spousal support based on cohabitation. Klein v. Klein, 2016 ND

                            The length of time spousal support is to be paid must have a factual basis in the record; supreme court was left with a firm conviction that a mistake had been made concerning the duration that spousal support was to be paid where there was no factual
                            basis in the record to support the duration ordered by the trial court. Smith v. Smith, 326 N.W.2d 697, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 397</cite> (N.D. 1982).

                            Where there was no rational connection between ending the spousal support award on the husband’s 65th birthday and the wife’s need for spousal support, award was modified to end when the husband retired or turned age 65, whichever occurred last. Walker

                            Ex-husband was entitled to abatement of spousal support he was required to pay because the plain language of the parties’ second amended judgment did not require ex-wife to be 65 years old, to be eligible to receive full social security benefits, or even
                            to receive social security benefits. Instead, the only requirement for termination of husband’s support obligation was that the wife be eligible to receive any social security benefits. Slorby v. Slorby, 2009 ND 11, 760 N.W.2d

                            If a husband agrees in a divorce action that, upon the entry of a decree in his favor, an order may be made requiring him to pay a certain sum monthly to the wife, the amount ordered paid is not alimony, but arises from express contract, and payment is

                            The circumstances considered in determining a suitable allowance to a wife who is granted a divorce include the needs of the wife and children, in the light of the family standards while living together, the wife’s health, other circumstances affecting

                            Conduct of the parties is only one factor the trial court must consider in awarding spousal support; it is not required that the award of spousal support be based on conduct alone.

                            Trial court abused its discretion in providing for a two-year automatic termination of a spousal support award to the wife where the husband’s future earning capacity was far greater than the wife’s and husband’s living expenses could be reduced while
                            the wife’s were fixed. Mees v. Mees, 325 N.W.2d 207, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 345</cite> (N.D. 1982).

                            was not an abuse of discretion given the wife’s age, health, limited education and work experience, and fact that rehabilitation beyond her present earning capacity was not likely. Briese v. Briese, 325 N.W.2d 245, 1982

                            Under the Ruff-Fischer guidelines, the court may consider such factors as the parties’ earning abilities, their financial circumstances and station in life in making an award of spousal support. Bagan v. Bagan, 382 N.W.2d 645, 1986

                            While the award of spousal support did not fall precisely within the technical definitions of either permanent or rehabilitative spousal support, this was not fatal to the award; in awarding spousal support, a court may properly recognize a spouse’s role
                            in contributing to the other spouse’s earning capacity which was developed and enhanced during the course of the marriage, and the determinative factor is the sufficiency of income to permit each party to maintain apart the
                            standard of living enjoyed together. Hanson v. Hanson, 404 N.W.2d 460, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 298</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                            Consideration of the divorcing parties’ earning abilities is one of the guidelines which are utilized when considering either the equitable distribution of property or the award of spousal support. Opoien v. Opoien, 425 N.W.2d 373, 1988

                            An award of support must be considered in light of the supporting spouse’s needs and ability to pay. Fleck v. Fleck, 427 N.W.2d 355, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                            Sources of income, in addition to earnings, are important in setting the amount of support for a disadvantaged spouse. For this reason, property division and spousal support often need to be examined and dealt with together. Pfliger v. Pfliger, 461 N.W.2d
                            432, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 203</cite> (N.D. 1990).

                            Continuance of a standard of living is a valid consideration in spousal support determinations, as is balancing the burdens created by the separation when it is impossible to maintain two households at the pre-divorce standard. Wahlberg v. Wahlberg, 479

                            Where the trial court awarded support for one year and thus support would end about the time the court estimated wife would be able to begin any rehabilitation from her multiple sclerosis, rather than the time she could possibly become rehabilitated,
                            trial court’s award of temporary, rehabilitative support was clearly erroneous, in view of wife’s financial position, lack of skills and training, limited prospects for future employment, and her incurable, progressively debilitating
                            disease; on remand, trial court was directed to award permanent support subject to future modification. Van Oosting v. Van Oosting, 521 N.W.2d 93, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite>                            (N.D. 1994).

Zuger, 1997 ND 97, 563 N.W.2d 804, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 98</cite>                            (N.D. 1997).

                            While the duration of the marriage is a factor in determining whether spousal support should be awarded, it may be appropriate to award spousal support regardless of the length of the marriage, and disparity in earning capacity is especially relevant.

                            Husband was entitled to spousal support based on the considerable disparity in the parties’ earning capacity, his foregone career opportunities and contributions to his wife’s earning abilities as a physician, and the need for support to re-enter the
                            job market after having been a stay-at-home dad. Moilan v. Moilan, 1999 ND 103, 598 N.W.2d 81, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D. 1999).

                            Permanent spousal support award to the wife was not clearly erroneous where she was “disadvantaged” due to her years of taking care of the children and an automobile accident which limited her ability to work full-time, there was no financial misconduct
                            by the wife, the marriage was long, there was a vast disparity in incomes, and the husband could later seek modification when he retired. Sommer v. Sommer, 2001 ND 191, 636 N.W.2d 423, 2001

                            Although the wife’s decision to leave the workforce and abandon career and educational opportunities suggested that she was a disadvantaged spouse, the district court erroneously failed to consider her lost opportunities, contributions to the husband’s
                            earning potential and the wife’s need for training to re-enter the job market; the court’s denial of spousal support was therefore clearly erroneous. Shields v. Shields, 2003 ND 16, 656 N.W.2d 712, 2003

                            Trial court erred in awarding a wife permanent spousal support in a divorce action because the husband was 67 years old and had been retired since 1990, while the wife was 64 years old and had been employed since 2000; while the wife was in relatively
                            good health, the husband was in poor health. Gustafson v. Gustafson, 2008 ND 233, 758 N.W.2d 895, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            Trial court did not commit clear error in refusing to award spousal support to a husband because, although the wife’s income was more than double that of the husband’s income, the trial court awarded the family farm and all farming equipment to the husband,
                            thus awarding to him the income-producing assets from the marriage, and because the husband failed to present evidence of his needs or the wife’s ability to pay. Dronen v. Dronen, 2009 ND 70, 764 N.W.2d 675, 2009

                            upon his current income despite the husband’s contention that he was soon to retire because the record contained only evidence that the wife was unable to support herself because she had little work experience and only a high
                            school education and that the husband was currently working full-time and able to support them both. Because the record contained no evidence concerning the husband’s actual retirement date and the actual income that he would
                            receive at that time, the district court did not err in basing its ruling upon the evidence available at trial; when the husband retired and his income was reduced, he could petition for a modification of his support obligation.

                            Permanent spousal support award was appropriate where the husband was skilled and had a good job in a business that could do well while, in contrast, the wife’s job prospects were remote. The district court properly analyzed each of the Ruff-Fischer guidelines
                            and focused on disparity in earning capacity between the parties when awarding permanent spousal support. Peterson v. Peterson, 2010 ND 165, 788 N.W.2d 296, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite>                            (N.D. 2010).

                            Trial court did not err in awarding a wife spousal support in the amount of $ 5,000 per month because it appropriately considered the Ruff-Fischer guidelines. Even if the wife returned to work, she would earn significantly less than the husband, a psychiatrist,
                            and it was unlikely that she could be equitably rehabilitated to make up for opportunities lost during the course of the marriage. Martiré v. Martiré, 2012 ND 197, 822 N.W.2d 450, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 205</cite>                            (N.D. 2012).

                            It was clear error to deny a father's request for spousal support without considering reserving jurisdiction because, if the father were considered disabled, the facts required reservation of jurisdiction as the father had a substantially lower income,
                            had no foreseeable ability to increase the father's income due to the father's disabilities, had potential need for support in the future, and the mother had a greater ability to pay support in the future. Harvey v. Harvey,

                            District court did not err in the calculation of spousal support when it awarded a former wife rehabilitative spousal support of $ 500 per month for 2 years because it considered all of the guidelines under Ruff v. Ruff, 78 N.D. 775, 52 N.W.2d 107 (1952),
                            and Fischer v. Fischer, 139 N.W.2d 845 (N.D. 1966); inter alia, the wife received a sizeable retirement fund, she received more in property division, she was in good health, income had been imputed to her, and she was able
                            to become employed as a nurse. Klein v. Klein, 2015 ND 236, 869 N.W.2d 750, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 251</cite> (N.D. 2015).

                            District court properly denied a wife an award of spousal support and declined to retain jurisdiction over spousal support because the money the wife would receive through wage income and payments from the husband would adequately address her current
                            needs, the husband, after being made responsible for the marital debts, payment for the property division, the tax liability, and his child support obligation, did not have the ability to pay spousal support until his child
                            support ended, and there was no need to award permanent spousal support to make up for the opportunities and development lost during the course of the marriage, whether it be a current award or a future award. Schmuck v. Schmuck,

                            Because no statutory or case law supports imputation of income for spousal support case, and the amount of support ordered exceeded the husband’s ability to pay, imputation of income to the husband was improper; equalization of income is not a goal of

                            District courts in matters pertaining to the granting of divorces and the payment of alimony do not have general equitable powers. Their jurisdiction in this respect is limited to that conferred by statute. Stoutland v. Estate of Stoutland, 103 N.W.2d

                            The definition of a pending action found in N.D.C.C. §

                            once a final determination has been made and the time for appeal has passed, a divorce decree is not “pending” until jurisdiction of the court is reinvoked by motion of a party. Fichter v. Kadrmas, 507 N.W.2d 72, 1993

                            As long as spousal support continues, the district court retains jurisdiction to award permanent spousal support. Quamme v. Bellino, 540 N.W.2d 142, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 210</cite> (N.D. 1995).

                            District court erred in reserving jurisdiction only “in the event” of nonpayment of the cash property distribution and attorney fees. This conclusion was demonstrated by the contingent nature of the spousal support award in the event of nonpayment in
                            the specific amount of cash and attorney fees awarded. Keita v. Keita, 2012 ND 234, 823 N.W.2d 726, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite> (N.D. 2012).

                            Party seeking modification of spousal support must move for modification during the duration of the support award because a court's jurisdiction to modify the award is coexistent with the ongoing nature of the support award, absent a reservation of jurisdiction
                            beyond the support period; therefore, a district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to modify spousal support that had terminated prior to the former wife filing a modification motion. The legislative history accompanying
                            this statute did not support a former wife's argument that the North Dakota Legislature had materially altered the district court's jurisdiction to modify a support award. Gronland v. Gronland, 2015 ND 251, 870 N.W.2d 217,

                            Fact that a division of property and award of alimony does not allow a person to maintain the same standard of living after the marriage is ended, as that person enjoyed during the marriage, does not necessitate a conclusion that the trial court’s findings

                            A decree distributing property, awarding support, and providing for the children of the marriage is something more than a decree for alimony in its proper legal signification and, where a decree was intended to be a final adjustment of the property rights
                            of the parties, the court was without power to amend the decree and to wipe out the monthly payment stipulated to the wife and substitute a gross sum therefor. Sinkler v. Sinkler, 49 N.D. 1144, 194 N.W. 817 (1923), distinguished,

                            Provisions of judgment relating to payment of alimony or support payments to wife were severable from provisions relating to division of property, and hence trial court and supreme court in trial de novo had power to modify judgment as it related to alimony

                            Court lacks jurisdiction to modify a decree to include alimony where the original decree awarded no alimony and contained no express reservation of jurisdiction to do so.

                            Where monthly payments made pursuant to settlement agreement incorporated into divorce judgment were for support rather than payments in lieu of an equitable distribution of the property, district court had jurisdiction to modify such payments upon a

                            Where alimony award to wife was in fact support and not part of an integrated property settlement agreement incorporated into the divorce decree, trial court had authority to modify the award by eliminating husband’s alimony obligation upon the wife’s
                            remarriage to another person where there were no extraordinary circumstances warranting the continued alimony payments. Clement v. Clement, 325 N.W.2d 262, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 358</cite>                            (N.D. 1982).

                            Ex-wife’s increase in salary of between $ 350 to $ 550 a month, while ex-husband’s income had remained approximately the same, was not such a change in circumstances as to warrant a reduction in the amount of spousal support awarded the ex-wife, especially
                            since ex-wife was required to make the mortgage payments on the parties’ home and, upon sale of the home, ex-husband was to receive 40 percent of the net proceeds. Muehler v. Muehler, 333 N.W.2d 432, 1983

                            Fact that since divorce former wife’s income had increased and slightly surpassed that of her former husband did not constitute a material change in circumstances, and modification of former husband’s alimony obligation was therefore not appropriate,
                            where increase in former wife’s income was due to her returning to school, obtaining a master’s degree, and then securing a higher level of professional employment; to hold such personal accomplishment constituted a change
                            in circumstances so as to allow a reduction in former husband’s alimony obligation would penalize former wife for her initiative and remove incentive for self-betterment. Lipp v. Lipp, 355 N.W.2d 817, 1984

                            While husband’s claim of “impossibility of compliance” due to a reduction in his salary might arguably have supported a motion under this section seeking a modification of the spousal support provision of the divorce judgment, it could not be said that
                            the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to apply N.D.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(vi), so as to vacate the divorce judgment in its entirety and, in its stead, adopt husband’s proposal for property distribution. Wolfe v. Wolfe,

                            Where the trial court expressly retained the continuing power to change support and maintenance, the trial court had the power to modify the spousal support provision in the divorce decree, even though the divorce decree incorporated the settlement agreement
                            which contemplated the wife’s employment earnings. Wheeler v. Wheeler, 419 N.W.2d 923, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                            A change of circumstances is the standard for a later modification of spousal support, not for making it as part of an initial determination. Heggen v. Heggen, 488 N.W.2d 627, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite>                            (N.D. 1992).

                            Divorcing spouses’ agreement, which was incorporated into the decree, to divest the trial court of jurisdiction to modify spousal support award was unambiguous and enforceable because the parties were both adults and free to bargain with their own legal
                            rights; the agreement did not violate public policy or the statute, so the trial court properly found that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the wife’s motion to modify the spousal support award. Toni v. Toni, 2001 ND 193,

                            Continuing jurisdiction of a trial court over those aspects of marital dissolution decrees is to be exercised prospectively on a reasoned and principled basis for good cause, such as a material change of circumstances. McWethy v. McWethy, 366 N.W.2d 796,

                            Trial court’s order increasing spousal support payments for wife from $ 150 to $ 400 per month and extending them for an additional five-year period would be upheld where wife had become totally disabled by a chronic condition (lupus) and where sale of

                            Wife’s realization of the proceeds from her personal injury claim, which was her separate property, was not, by itself, a reason to end spousal support. However, her overall financial circumstances in her second marriage were relevant for the trial court

                            of attorney fees and costs incurred in resisting the motion, the trial court’s finding that there had been no material change of circumstances warranting a reduction in the husband’s spousal support obligation was not clearly
                            erroneous where (1) the husband testified that he earned, and could continue to earn, $ 1,400 per day plus an additional $ 175 per hour for overtime, which ranged anywhere from zero to ten hours; and (2) although the husband’s
                            financial circumstances had changed, it was not a material change because he continued to have the ability to meet his stipulated spousal support obligation. Rothberg v. Rothberg, 2007 ND 24, 727 N.W.2d 771, 2007

                            of its decision; the trial court did not explain why the husband’s reduction in income resulting from his retirement was not a change in circumstances. Ebach v. Ebach, 2008 ND 187, 757 N.W.2d 34, 2008

                            In light of wife’s age, limited education, work experience, the job market, and other factors, award of alimony to wife payable to her death or remarriage was not clearly erroneous. Gooselaw v. Gooselaw, 320 N.W.2d 490, 1982

                            Where the wife suffered from severe medical problems, and the husband was awarded most of the marital property in the divorce action, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the wife was incapable of rehabilitation beyond her present earning
                            capacity, thereby justifying an award of permanent spousal support. Routledge v. Routledge, 377 N.W.2d 542, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                            Unlimited spousal support can be a courtroom trip for the unwary. A trial court will act to terminate unlimited spousal support upon death or remarriage of the supported spouse unless there are extraordinary circumstances which justify its continuance.
                            Therefore, it is preferable for a trial court to spell out preordained contingency limits of spousal support in the divorce decree. Roen v. Roen, 438 N.W.2d 170, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 64</cite>                            (N.D. 1989).

                            Indefinite support is merited when a spouse cannot be adequately restored to independent economic status. Thus where the record reflected no change in wife’s status at age 65 which would negate her needs, the court would reverse the provision that wife’s
                            support would end at age 65. Martin v. Martin, 450 N.W.2d 768, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 28</cite> (N.D. 1990).

                            Where court concluded that wife would remain disadvantaged by the divorce and would be incapable of independently sustaining her standard of living, this was a proper basis for awarding permanent spousal support. Gronland v. Gronland, 527 N.W.2d 250,

                            Award of permanent support to wife was affirmed where the parties had a financial partnership in a construction company, based in part on the 10 years they lived together before getting married, and where the company, awarded to the husband, had a substantial
                            value, and there would be a substantial disparity between the parties’ earning abilities after the divorce. Kautzman v. Kautzman, 1998 ND 192, 585 N.W.2d 561, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 195</cite>                            (N.D. 1998).

                            Award of permanent spousal support was reversed and remanded because the district court’s findings, while detailed, did not provide an adequate explanation of the decision to award permanent support when the wife testified she only required support for
                            ten years; while it was not erroneous for the district court to award permanent support, it was erroneous to do so without providing sufficient explanation for its decision in light of the testimony heard at trial. Ingebretson

                            Trial court did not err in awarding the ex-wife $ 1,200 per month for permanent spousal support under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-24.1" target="_self">14-05-24.1</a></cite> because (1) the ex-husband
                            earned approximately $ 107,000 per year, and the wife earned approximately $ 25,000 per year; (2) the wife’s earning ability was limited by her age, lack of education, health problems limiting her ability to do strenuous work,
                            long absence from the work force, reasonable wish to remain in the city where the parties had resided until their child graduated from high school, and lack of income if she were to pursue further education or training; (3)
                            wife was prevented from maintaining significant employment or pursuing educational opportunities during the marriage due to frequent relocations to enhance the husband’s earning ability; (4) wife would never approach his income-producing
                            ability even if she returned to school; and (5) the husband had the financial ability to pay the wife $ 1,200 per month in permanent spousal support while still maintaining his standard of living in the Chicago area. Christian

                            Permanent spousal support was properly awarded because the husband was employed at a community college for which he received $ 52,225 per year, he also earned $ 11,125 in the summer of 2008, and the wife testified that she made $ 12 an hour and worked
                            forty hours per week. While the wife previously worked two jobs, she terminated the second job on medical advice. Parisien v. Parisien, 2010 ND 35, 779 N.W.2d 130, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite>                            (N.D. 2010).

                            Permanent spousal support was properly awarded because the court did not improperly fail to consider the property award in determining support; the court focused on the husband’s greater earning capacity; his marital, financial, and criminal misconduct;
                            the wife’s necessities to maintain her home; her health; and the origin of the marital property. Parisien v. Parisien, 2010 ND 35, 779 N.W.2d 130, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite>                            (N.D. 2010).

                            District court’s decision to award permanent spousal support was not clearly erroneous because the parties were married for 20 years and were in their forties; the ex-wife was diagnosed with ADHD and depression which adversely affected her ability to
                            return to her former occupation, while the ex-husband’s earning ability was relatively constant; the ex-wife had not worked in speech pathology for a number of years and she did not believe she could return to that work; the
                            parties earned a significant marital income and lived accordingly and both parties’ expenses were reflective of how they had lived in the past and continued to live; and the ex-husband had the ability to pay permanent spousal
                            support. Becker v. Becker, 2011 ND 107, 799 N.W.2d 53, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 113</cite> (N.D. 2011).

                            District court did not err by ordering the husband to pay permanent spousal support to the wife pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-24.1" target="_self">14-05-24.1</a></cite> to ensure that the

                            District court did not err in awarding the mother permanent spousal support because the long-term projections from the company, in which the father was a minority shareholder, were too speculative to support an award of permanent spousal support. Conzemius

                            District court did not err in awarding the ex-wife permanent spousal support because she would be unable to command an income comparable to that of the ex-husband, even after retraining because, in part, she forewent employment prospects to further the
                            husband's legal career and to care for the parties' children, which decreased her earning capacity; the relatively low award of net marital property, taken with her limited earning capacity, was insufficient to allow the wife
                            to maintain a standard of living approximating that to which she became accustomed to during the marriage; and the husband failed to provide any information pertaining to proposed rehabilitation, including probable starting
                            salary, potential future salary, and benefits. Stock v. Stock, 2016 ND 1, 873 N.W.2d 38, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 1</cite> (N.D. 2016).

                            Ex-husband was unable to show that he could not pay the permanent spousal support awarded to the ex-wife because, while law firm bonuses were subject to change based upon the vicissitudes of legal practice, nothing in the record demonstrated that the
                            husband was incapable or unlikely to earn a bonus sufficing to cover the difference between his expenses and his base pay; his past bonuses, along with being in the early stages of his legal career, indicated the husband had
                            a reasonable chance of earning similar or larger bonuses as his career matured; and, if his legal practice suffered so he could no longer pay that amount, he could ask the court to modify the support to an amount more befitting
                            of his financial reality. Stock v. Stock, 2016 ND 1, 873 N.W.2d 38, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 1</cite> (N.D. 2016).

                            Purpose underlying alimony or spousal support is rehabilitative; to allow disadvantaged spouse time and resources to acquire new skills. Delorey v. Delorey, 357 N.W.2d 488, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D.
                            1984).

                        <p>
                            The trial court did not err by failing to award fifty-seven year old wife permanent alimony in an amount that would pay her reasonable living expenses, where the court viewed the temporary alimony which it awarded as rehabilitative spousal support, finding
                            that wife was capable of working and thus expecting her to be gainfully employed to supplement her income, and determined that in five years she would have income from Social Security, accumulated interest, her condominium
                            and a cash reserve, with no debts or mortgages. Linn v. Linn, 370 N.W.2d 536, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 343</cite> (N.D. 1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The state of a specific time when spousal support payments will cease, rather than a time period uncertain in duration, will more readily effectuate the rehabilitative purposes of spousal support. The case was remanded to the district court for purposes
                            of modifying the judgment to provide fifty-year old wife with spousal support for such a time as might be found to be reasonably necessary for her to secure education and training whereby she might become self-supporting. Hedin

                        <p>
                            The purpose underlying alimony or spousal support is rehabilitation to allow the disadvantaged party time and resources to acquire new skills. It may be for a limited period of time or it may be permanent to provide the traditional maintenance for a party
                            incapable of rehabilitation. Hedin v. Hedin, 370 N.W.2d 544, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 344</cite> (N.D. 1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The fact that the wife is capable of rehabilitation should not in itself deprive her of reasonable spousal support where she is likely to have a much lower income producing capacity than the husband, which earning capacity she aided the husband in obtaining
                            through her contribution as the homemaker. Weir v. Weir, 374 N.W.2d 858, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 385</cite> (N.D. 1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the functions of spousal support is rehabilitation of the party who has been disadvantaged by the divorce. If rehabilitation is not possible, spousal support may be permanent to provide maintenance for the disadvantaged party. Weir v. Weir, 374
                            N.W.2d 858, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 385</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                        <p>
                            When the circumstances are appropriate, rehabilitative spousal support may continue after the remarriage of the disadvantaged spouse. Bullock v. Bullock, 376 N.W.2d 30, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 422</cite> (N.D.
                            1985).

                        <p>
                            The North Dakota Supreme Court has expressly rejected the view that spousal support is a continuation of the duty of one spouse to support the other during marriage, and has accepted the theory of rehabilitative spousal support. Routledge v. Routledge,
                            377 N.W.2d 542, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1985).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rehabilitative spousal support, in theory, allows the disadvantaged party time and resources to acquire an education or work skills. Where a party is incapable of rehabilitation, permanent spousal support may be awarded to provide traditional maintenance.

                        <p>
                            Rehabilitative spousal support is awarded to provide an opportunity for a disadvantaged spouse to seek education, training, or experience that will enable this spouse to become self-supporting. Rustand v. Rustand, 379 N.W.2d 806, 1986
                            <cite

                            Trial court’s award in a divorce action of rehabilitative spousal support for eight years was not clearly erroneous, where the court based its award on the reasonableness of wife’s wish to postpone her four-year educational rehabilitation until the youngest
                            child was in school. Bagan v. Bagan, 382 N.W.2d 645, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 266</cite> (N.D. 1986).

                        <p>
                            Wife’s liaison with another man would not disqualify her from an award of rehabilitative spousal support, where she testified that she became involved with another man only in the final month she and husband lived together, and the record was clear that,
                            by that point in time, the marriage was irretrievably broken. Bader v. Bader, 448 N.W.2d 187, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 223</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            Rehabilitative spousal support is awarded to provide an opportunity for a disadvantaged spouse to seek education, training, or experience that will enable the spouse to become self-supporting. Weigel v. Kraft, 449 N.W.2d 583, 1989

                        <p>
                            The purpose of rehabilitative support may be described in terms of enabling a disadvantaged spouse to achieve “suitable” and “appropriate” self-support. Wahlberg v. Wahlberg, 479 N.W.2d 143, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite>                            (N.D. 1992).

                        <p>
                            The need which evidences that one spouse has been disadvantaged by the divorce and that rehabilitative support is, therefore, appropriate is not limited to the prevention of destitution. Rather, rehabilitative spousal support must serve one of the legitimate
                            goals for such an award and be supported by the record. Wahlberg v. Wahlberg, 479 N.W.2d 143, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 1992).

                            Where spouse had a full-time job and significant assets when she entered marriage, and had neither when the marriage ended, trial court’s award of rehabilitative support was not clearly erroneous. Fenske v. Fenske, 542 N.W.2d 98, 1996

                            Trial court’s award to wife of $ 800.00 per month in rehabilitative spousal support for an additional one year only was not clearly erroneous given that the wife had received a much larger share of the net marital estate, she had already received $ 25,000
                            in spousal support, and she had professional skills and training as a court reporter which could earn her a significant income. Schiff v. Schiff, 2000 ND 113, 611 N.W.2d 191, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite>                            (N.D. 2000).

                            Trial court did not err when it found wife was a disadvantaged spouse entitled to spousal support where the wife maintained the parties’ home and cared for their children, contributing to the husband’s increased earning capacity, remaining out of the
                            workforce, foregoing the opportunities and advantages that paid work generated, losing the increased earning capacity that work experience provided, and losing the opportunity to create a right to lifetime retirement benefits.

                            Decision to make the wife’s spousal support award rehabilitative instead of permanent was not clearly erroneous because the district court concluded the wife’s monthly expenses would be about $ 3300 and her monthly income would be $ 2400, the district
                            court found the wife would need monthly support of $ 900 to meet her expenses until she was able to increase her income, and the district court found her education and skills would allow her to realize an income increase, thereby
                            negating the need for permanent support. Staley v. Staley, 2004 ND 195, 688 N.W.2d 182, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 326</cite> (N.D. 2004).

                            Court properly awarded a former wife temporary rehabilitative spousal support because the court found that the wife was 41 years old at the time of the divorce, had a two year degree, had not been employed outside the home since her tanning business closed,
                            and was in good physical health, with some mental health issues. The court also found that the wife was a disadvantaged spouse because she had forgone opportunities or lost advantages as a consequence of the marriage and she
                            contributed during the marriage to the husband’s earning capacity. DeMers v. DeMers, 2006 ND 142, 717 N.W.2d 545, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 2006).

                            Trial court’s award of rehabilitative spousal support to a mother was not clearly erroneous because (1) the mother was unemployed, (2) the mother’s unemployment insurance would expire shortly, and (3) the father was able to pay some reasonable support

                            District court did not err in awarding a wife rehabilitative spousal support for four years because the court considered the conduct of the parties, balanced their financial needs and ability to pay, and the disparity in the net awards was appropriate
                            in lieu of the additional alimony that the wife needed, but which the husband could not afford, and also to partially equalize the disparity in anticipated retirement income between the parties. Williams v. Williams, 2015 ND

                            When modification of rehabilitative spousal support is sought there are two appropriate grounds. The first of these grounds is an abandonment by the disadvantaged spouse of a good faith effort to become economically rehabilitated. The second ground is
                            the accomplishment of the rehabilitative goal. Rustand v. Rustand, 379 N.W.2d 806, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 243</cite> (N.D. 1986); Weigel v. Kraft, 449 N.W.2d 583, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 244</cite>                            (N.D. 1989).

                            District court did not err in refusing to excuse husband from the balance of the $ 10,800 rehabilitative spousal support initially awarded to wife and in ordering the support to be paid in a lump sum, despite husband’s argument that wife had “rehabilitated”
                            her career by attending a one-year business school, incurring a debt of $ 2,419 to attend the school, and that he should not be obligated to pay more than that amount. After completion of the business program, wife became self-employed
                            as a painter and wall-paperer and had a net income $ 5166.68 in 1988. In light of her financial circumstances, wife may not have completely attained the goal of being fully self-supporting and might need further education to

                            The trial court, in determining whether an award of spousal support is appropriate, is to consider the guidelines set forth in Ruff v. Ruff (1952) 78 N.D. 775, 52 N.W.2d 107, and Fischer v. Fischer, 139 N.W.2d 845 (N.D. 1966). Factors to be considered
                            include the respective ages of the parties, their earning ability, the duration of the marriage and conduct of the parties during the marriage, their station in life, the circumstances and necessities of each, their health
                            and physical condition, their financial circumstances as shown by the property owned at the time, its value at the time, its income-producing capacity, if any, whether accumulated before or after the marriage, and such other
                            matters as may be material. Routledge v. Routledge, 377 N.W.2d 542, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 426</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                        <p>
                            Award of spousal support to the wife was appropriate pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-24.1" target="_self">14-05-24.1</a></cite> because the trial court was not obligated to make specific
                            findings of every Ruff-Fischer factor; the trial court was not required to indicate why it awarded her spousal support for 10 years; and the wife proved her standard of living with an affidavit and testimony. Solem v. Solem,
                            2008 ND 211, 757 N.W.2d 748, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 234</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            Trial court’s award of spousal support to a wife in a divorce action was overturned because, although the trial court made specific findings under the Ruff-Fischer guidelines, there was no evidence presented at trial regarding the wife’s need for, and
                            the husband’s ability to pay, spousal support. Overland v. Overland, 2008 ND 6, 744 N.W.2d 67, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 8</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            Supreme court was unable to discern if the district court considered the mother’s underemployment when it determined her need for spousal support; without further explanation regarding the mother’s need for spousal support, the supreme court was unable
                            to determine whether the district court’s award of spousal support was clearly erroneous, and the award was reversed and remanded to the district court for further proceedings regarding the mother’s need for, and the father’s
                            ability to pay, spousal support. Lindberg v. Lindberg, 2009 ND 136, 770 N.W.2d 252, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. 2009).

                        <p>
                            In a marital dissolution case, a court erred when it denied a wife’s claim for spousal support because it did not provide an analysis of whether the Ruff-Fischer guideline factors favored or disfavored an award of spousal support; this determination included
                            more than disparity of income. Paulson v. Paulson, 2010 ND 100, 783 N.W.2d 262, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 2010).

                            District court ordered the husband to pay the wife $ 20 a month in spousal support and noted that if her health declined in the future, as she had recently battled cancer, she could seek modification of the award; after making the requisite findings of
                            fact, the district court adequately explained its decision to award the wife a nominal amount of spousal support, which was not clearly erroneous. McCarthy v. McCarthy, 2014 ND 234, 856 N.W.2d 762, 2014

                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding spousal support to the wife, who was also awarded custody of the four children, in an amount and for a duration sufficient to enable her to obtain a college degree. Smith v. Smith, 326 N.W.2d 697, 1982

                            Where wife had a college degree in teaching, was in good health, and only 31 years old, trial court’s award of spousal support to her in the form of house and real estate tax payments was not clearly erroneous from a rehabilitative objective where she
                            had never taught, followed her husband to another state where she worked as a part-time checkout clerk, worked in a bank on her return to North Dakota before being laid off, was presently working part-time at the hospital,
                            and would have to take some additional classes before being qualified to obtain her teaching certificate. Jondahl v. Jondahl, 344 N.W.2d 63, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D.

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding wife alimony in nature of spousal support in amount of $ 1,200 per month until she received her property division share of husband’s military pension in an amount at least equal to alimony award or
                            until she died, whichever occurs first, where at time of divorce husband’s annual compensation was approximately $ 50,000 and wife was not working; wife, although holding a bachelor’s degree and having taught school in past,
                            would have to return to school to obtain an active teaching certificate; job market for teachers in area was limited and wife could have been an established teacher had she not been a military spouse; and there was a considerable
                            disparity in earning abilities of parties and rehabilitation beyond wife’s present earning capacity was not likely in near future. Bullock v. Bullock, 354 N.W.2d 904, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 372</cite>                            (N.D. 1984).

                        <p>
                            Trial court properly awarded wife spousal support in amount of $ 300 per month for a period of eighteen months where she had been disadvantaged by divorce regardless of whether or not she received greater share in property division or was employed at
                            time of divorce; employment is just one of factors considered in determining whether or not an award of spousal support is appropriate. Oviatt v. Oviatt, 355 N.W.2d 825, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 405</cite>                            (N.D. 1984).

                        <p>
                            In view of the husband’s earning capacity as demonstrated by his past income and employment, his stated plans to sell his business and seek more lucrative employment, and his ability to seek modification of the judgment under this section if he were unable
                            to meet the spousal support obligation when it became due, trial court’s award of $ 10,000 to be paid when the wife entered college or three years from the date of judgment was not clearly erroneous. Hanson v. Hanson, 404 N.W.2d
                            460, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 298</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                        <p>
                            Where, in a divorce action, the husband’s monthly income was approximately $ 1,900 while the wife’s income was approximately $ 800 per month, the court’s determination on spousal and child support were not clearly erroneous in awarding $ 350 per month
                            child support and $ 200 rehabilitative spousal support. Fleck v. Fleck, 427 N.W.2d 355, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                        <p>
                            Failure of trial court to award wife spousal support was not clearly erroneous where wife was a high school graduate, with one year of college, had employment as a waitress and carpenter and had developed farming skills during the marriage, and where
                            although husband received a majority of the income-producing property, property was saddled with debt and husband had multiple sclerosis; however, the trial court should retain jurisdiction over spousal support in the event
                            of a significant change of circumstances. Lucy v. Lucy, 456 N.W.2d 539, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 127</cite> (N.D. 1990).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where spouse had little work experience, no training, and only a high school education, and would be required to use her property settlement payments either to assist her in obtaining job training, or merely to survive if she chose to stay home and care
                            for the children in her custody, she showed a need for spousal support, at least until she could rehabilitate herself, and the trial court’s failure to award spousal support was erroneous. Heley v. Heley, 506 N.W.2d 715, 1993
                            <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 176</cite> (N.D. 1993).

                        <p>
                            In awarding spousal support where wife had not worked since the birth of their first child in 1982, and had been diagnosed as suffering from undifferentiated connective tissue disease, which would probably limit her ability to attend classes and to obtain
                            employment, the trial court reasonably inferred that six years of assistance was appropriate, due in part to the likelihood that her education and career would be hampered by her failing health and by the burden of being custodial
                            parent to three young children. Beals v. Beals, 517 N.W.2d 413, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 1994).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given substantial disparity in parties’ earning power, likely inability of wife to greatly increase her earning capacity, her serious ongoing health problems, and trial court’s award of major income producing marital asset to husband, award of only temporary
                            support of $ 600 per month to wife was clearly erroneous. Wald v. Wald, 556 N.W.2d 291, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 269</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            District court’s decision to award a former wife eight years of spousal support was not erroneous because the record showed that the wife had a limited education, had not worked outside of the home for any substantial amount of time during the marriage,
                            was the primary caretaker of the children, and only received a limited income from a home daycare business; in contrast, the husband had served with the military during the entire marriage. Cannaday v. Cannaday, 2003 ND 58,
                            659 N.W.2d 363, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                        <p>
                            Although a trial court could have awarded spousal support without a reduction after four years, based on the length of the parties’ marriage, the disparity in their income, the wife’s age, and their high standard of living, the award was not clearly erroneous
                            because the wife was capable of rehabilitation. Sommers v. Sommers, 2003 ND 77, 660 N.W.2d 586, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                            Award in favor of the wife of $ 900 per month in spousal support for two years was affirmed because the district court’s decision was not clearly erroneous, as the district court found that the parties’ station in life was very similar because they had
                            similar time until reaching retirement age, both were college educated, had significant work experience and were capable of earning significant income through employment, both parties were in good health, with the exception
                            of the wife’s diabetes, which the district court found was well controlled and did not affect her ability to work, and it was clear from the record and the district court’s findings that the property distribution was equal
                            and both parties received property with little income-producing potential. Staley v. Staley, 2004 ND 195, 688 N.W.2d 182, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 326</cite> (N.D. 2004).

                            District court did not err by awarding a former wife $ 3,000 per month in spousal support for a period of 20 years where she only earned 10 percent of the salary of her former husband; notwithstanding the distribution scheme employed by the district court
                            in favor of the wife, she would have been unable to maintain her pre-divorce standard of living. Wold v. Wold, 2008 ND 14, 744 N.W.2d 541, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 14</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            Trial court’s award of permanent spousal support to the wife was not clearly erroneous, because the wife could not compete in the job market and the income from her awarded property would vary, the wife’s monthly income was $ 365 per month from social
                            security, the marriage was of long duration and the wife was a full participant in the farming and tax ventures during the marriage, and the husband stood to benefit significantly from his parent’s estate, or at least have
                            the use of a great deal of property for the duration of his life. Krueger v. Krueger, 2008 ND 90, 748 N.W.2d 671, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 99</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            District court did not err in awarding a father at least $ 2,500 per month for 15 years in spousal support because the parties received almost an equal amount of marital property; the district court considered the father’s take home pay and the amount
                            that he received in child support. The father needed assistance to meet his monthly expenses and to further his education. Wessman v. Wessman, 2008 ND 62, 747 N.W.2d 85, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite>                            (N.D. 2008).

                            generic challenges to various findings, he did not demonstrate that any finding was induced by an erroneous view of the law or that any finding was without support in the evidence, and the reviewing court was not left with
                            a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake. Paulson v. Paulson, 2011 ND 159, 801 N.W.2d 746, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 162</cite> (N.D. 2011).

                            Award of spousal support to a wife was not clearly erroneous because the trial court did not determine whether the wife was a “disadvantaged spouse,” but instead it correctly applied the guideline factors and looked at the needs and abilities of each
                            spouse. Holte v. Holte, 2013 ND 174, 837 N.W.2d 894, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2013).

                            under the Ruff-Fischer guidelines. Holte v. Holte, 2013 ND 174, 837 N.W.2d 894, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2013).

                            District court's award of temporary spousal support was not clearly erroneous; the district court stated its award was based upon the husband's self-limitation in his earning capacity and the financial stability he obtained from the property division,
                            and the district court's decision has valid reasons which were fairly discernible. Lizakowski v. Lizakowski, 2017 ND 91, 893 N.W.2d 508, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 2017).

                            The equitable division of property has for its basis the husband’s and the wife’s respective rights to an equitable portion of the property which has been accumulated by the parties through their joint efforts and for their mutual benefit during the marriage,
                            while the function of alimony is a form of support for rehabilitating the party disadvantaged by the divorce; an equitable distribution of property must be made by the trial court while an award of alimony is within the discretion
                            of such court to make or refuse. Williams v. Williams, 302 N.W.2d 754, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 232</cite> (N.D. 1981).

                            In discerning whether an amount paid by one spouse to the other is a property division or spousal support, several factors must be considered. Factors which may indicate that the payments are distributions of property include: payments that do not terminate
                            after the obligee dies, payments that continue even after obligee remarries excluding the payments in controversy, a large disparity in the property divided which is otherwise unexplained, payments that do not terminate on
                            the obligor’s death. In addition, security for payment may tend to indicate property distribution since deferred-property payments are dischargeable in bankruptcy, unlike spousal-support payments. Redlin v. Redlin, 436 N.W.2d

                            Factors which may indicate the amount paid by one spouse to the other is spousal support include: payments are monthly and payments terminate upon the obligee’s death or remarriage. Redlin v. Redlin, 436 N.W.2d 5, 1989

                            Because the award of income from mineral interests was to terminate upon spouse’s death or remarriage, and because she was to pay taxes on these payments, they were in the nature of spousal support. Ness v. Ness, 467 N.W.2d 716, 1991

                            Husband was awarded business property and farmland, and the wife argued that the lack of an award of income producing property and spousal support would require her to deplete her marital equity for her support, but the district court considered the factors
                            and requests of the parties and found the husband arranged to purchase the farmland from his family, and the decision was based on sufficient evidence and was not clearly erroneous. Schiff v. Schiff, 2013 ND 142, 835 N.W.2d

                            Continuance of a standard of living is a valid consideration in spousal support determinations. Bagan v. Bagan, 382 N.W.2d 645, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 266</cite> (N.D. 1986).

                            It is immaterial whether the spousal support is permanent or rehabilitative. The determinative factor is the sufficiency of income to permit each party to maintain apart the standard of living enjoyed together. Bagan v. Bagan, 382 N.W.2d 645, 1986

                            A party in a divorce proceeding, seeking spousal support to maintain a standard of living, must prove what that standard of living is and what it will take to maintain it, although this does not have to be proven with mathematical precision. Bagan v.

    Security for alimony — Disposition of homestead.

                <p>
                    The court may require either party to give reasonable security for providing maintenance or making any payments required under the provisions of this chapter and may enforce the same by appointment of a receiver or by any other remedy applicable to the
                    case. When either the husband or the wife has a separate estate sufficient to give a proper support, the court in its discretion may withhold any allowance to that person out of the separate property of the other spouse. The court,
                    in rendering the decree of divorce, may assign the homestead or such part thereof as to the court may seem just, to the innocent party, either absolutely or for a limited period, according to the facts in the case and in consonance
                    with the law relating to homesteads. The disposition of the homestead by the court, and all orders and decrees touching the alimony and maintenance of either party to a marriage and for the custody, education, and support of the children
                    are subject to revision on appeal in all particulars, including those which are stated to be in the discretion of the court.

                            The supreme court has no jurisdiction, while an action for divorce is pending in the district court, to entertain a motion for the allowance of counsel fees to take an appeal from an order of the district court requiring the husband to provide for the
                            maintenance of the wife, pending final determination of the action, and for counsel fees in the district court. Tonn v. Tonn, 16 N.D. 17, 111 N.W. 609, 1907 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 12</cite>                            (N.D. 1907).

                            An order denying modification of spousal and child support obligations is certainly an order “touching the alimony and maintenance of either party to a marriage and for the …support of the children” within the meaning of this section, and the Court of
                            Appeals had jurisdiction to consider husband’s appeal from the order denying his motion for modification. Mahoney v. Mahoney, 516 N.W.2d 656, 1994 N.D. App. LEXIS 6 (N.D. Ct. App. 1994).

                            In discerning whether an amount paid by one spouse to the other is a property division or spousal support, several factors must be considered. Factors which may indicate that the payments are distributions of property include: payments do not terminate
                            after the obligee dies; payments continue even after obligee remarries excluding the payments in controversy; a large disparity in the property divided which is otherwise unexplained; and payments do not terminate on the obligor’s
                            death. In addition, security for payment may tend to indicate property distribution since deferred-property payments are dischargeable in bankruptcy, unlike spousal-support payments. Redlin v. Redlin, 436 N.W.2d 5, 1989

                            Where, in a divorce action, the husband had not presented to the trial court his concern that the delayed property judgment in his favor could be rendered unenforceable under the homestead exemption, the Supreme Court remanded for determination whether
                            reasonable security should be provided by the wife. Fleck v. Fleck, 427 N.W.2d 355, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                            Where wife sued for divorce after thirty years of marriage during which the husband drank to excess for seventeen years, physically abused the wife and spoke of her in vile and offensive language, and finally became interested in and openly associated

                            The district court has no power to decree that the provision for alimony payable in monthly installments is a lien upon all the property of the husband and upon moneys he may acquire; such provision is not a definite liability or a judgment for a specific

                            Father’s repeated failure to pay his adjudicated child support obligations justified the trial court, in the exercise of its broad equitable power, to require that any monies from a judgment or settlement relating to an automobile accident in which he

                            Among the factors to be considered in an award of support money to a wife, where a divorce is denied, but separation appears inevitable, are the standard of living maintained while they were living together and the ability of the husband to pay. HENRY

                        Where it appears that a decree of separation has been in effect for more than four years and reconciliation is improbable, the trial court must exercise sound judicial discretion in determining whether the decree of separate maintenance should be revoked
                        and a divorce granted; the original fault that caused the separation does not control the discretion of the court, but it may be considered along with other material facts in arriving at a decision. Faleide v. Faleide, 76 N.D.

                        Although reconciliation, if accompanied by other factors, may be a reason to deny a divorce, the only method to revoke a separation judgment which is in existence is set forth in this section; therefore, despite the fact that the parties disregarded their
                        separation judgment, it continued to be valid and binding upon them until revoked. Fedora v. Fedora, 403 N.W.2d 10, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 280</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                        Where in his divorce complaint, the husband referred to the separation judgment and asked that its terms be declared null and void, he did not strictly adhere to the statutory procedure, but he did ask that the separation judgment be revoked and that
                        the trial court grant the parties a divorce and divide the property in an equitable manner, the method used was adequate to inform the wife and the court of what he was seeking and was properly treated as a request to revoke the
                        separation judgment. Fedora v. Fedora, 403 N.W.2d 10, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 280</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The legislative assembly finds that there are an ever-increasing number of persons in this state who, having fulfilled a role as homemaker, find themselves “displaced” in their middle years through separation, divorce, death or disability of spouse, or
                    other loss of support. As a consequence, displaced homemakers are very often without any source of income; they are usually ineligible for categorical welfare assistance; they are subject to one of the highest unemployment rates of
                    any sector of the workforce; they often face continuing discrimination in employment because they are older and have no recent paid work experience; they are often ineligible for unemployment insurance because they have been engaged
                    in unpaid labor in the home; they are often ineligible for social security because they are too young, and many will never qualify for social security because they have been divorced from the family wage earner; they have often lost
                    their rights as beneficiaries under employers’ pension and health plans through divorce or death of spouse, despite many years of contribution to the family well-being; and they are most often ineligible for medical assistance and
                    are generally unacceptable to private health insurance plans because of their age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the intention of the legislative assembly in enacting this chapter to provide the necessary counseling and guidance, job readiness training, and services for displaced homemakers so that they may enjoy the independence and economic security vital
                    to a productive life and to improve the health and welfare of this ever-growing group of citizens.

                            The marriage dissolution fee does not significantly interfere with a person’s right to obtain a divorce; the fee does not prohibit a person from a divorce because it may be waived if the applicant is indigent. Gange v. Clerk of Burleigh County Dist. Court,
                            429 N.W.2d 429, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                        <p>
                            It was reasonable for the Legislature to believe that most of the persons who would qualify as a displaced homemaker in need of program assistance would become so through a breakup of the family unit; it is therefore rational to raise funds for the program
                            by requiring payment of a reasonable fee in divorce, separation, and annulment actions. Gange v. Clerk of Burleigh County Dist. Court, 429 N.W.2d 429, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 254</cite>                            (N.D. 1988).

                </h3>
                <p>
                    A husband and wife cannot by any contract with each other alter their marital relations, except that they may agree in writing to an immediate separation and may make provision for the support of either of them and of their children during such separation.
                    The mutual consent of the parties is a sufficient consideration for such a separation agreement.

                            Former wife was jointly and severally liable for the debt incurred by her former husband for necessary medical care while they were married and living together, because the essential elements of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-07s14-07-08" target="_self">14-07-08</a></cite>(3)
                            were satisfied. The indemnification language in the divorce judgment between the husband and wife did not affect the collection company’s statutory right to recover the debt; res judicata did not apply because there was no
                            identity of parties, subject matter, or cause of action between the divorce proceeding and the collection proceeding. Recovery Res., LLC v. Cupido, 2012 ND 143, 818 N.W.2d 787, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 142</cite>                            (N.D. 2012).

                    court may proceed with the trial of the defendant on the original charge, or may pronounce sentence under the original conviction, or may enforce the suspended sentence, as the case may be. The spouse or child, and any person furnishing
                    necessary food, shelter, clothing, or medical attention to either, may sue upon the bond for a breach of any condition.

                            District court’s finding that neither part had engaged in domestic violence was clearly erroneous because the record established that the mother assaulted and caused physical harm to her mother, which constituted domestic violence under factor (1)(j).

                            Trial court properly granted primary residential responsibility of a child to the father because it did not clearly err by concluding there was insufficient evidence of domestic violence involving serious bodily injury; there was a protection order preventing
                            contact between the parties based on threats the father made to the mother’s father over the phone, and determining there was no serious bodily injury involved in those incidents was not clear error. Zuraff v. Reiger, 2018

                            tax exemption favoring him were threats of future conduct and did not denote immediacy so as to place the mother in fear of harm occurring without delay and thus such threats did not constitute domestic violence requiring visitation

                            Because judicial notice was taken of a domestic violence protection order proceeding, a district court should have decided if two alleged sexual assaults constituted domestic violence under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1)(j),

                            Trial court did not err in finding that a mother had not committed domestic violence by spanking and slapping her child across the face; the child protection service assessment report indicated neither parent abused or engaged in any inappropriate behavior

                            Trial court abused its discretion when it disallowed husband’s evidence of alleged previous acts of abuse committed by his wife and about why he feared for his personal safety at the time of this confrontation given that acts committed in self-defense
                            are statutorily excluded from the definition of domestic abuse, and the testimony offered was clearly relevant because of its bearing on whether husband acted in self-defense; however, because husband was permitted to testify
                            elsewhere regarding previous acts of abuse and his state of mind, the trial court’s error in excluding this relevant evidence was not prejudicial, did not affect husband’s substantial rights, and constituted harmless error.

                            A domestic violence protection order under the “Adult Abuse” statutes is a civil action primarily for injunctive relief, in which the party who has the burden of proof must establish the essential elements of the claim by a preponderance of the evidence.

                            A protection order was not an impermissible modification of a divorce decree where the decree granted father certain visitation rights whereby he would give mother 24 hours advance notice of his request for visitation, but through the granting of the
                            protection order would be unable to contact mother directly to arrange visitation and would have to go through a third party (his parents) to pick up and deliver the children. Steckler v. Steckler, 492 N.W.2d 76, 1992

                            Altering the husband’s visitation rights was within the district court’s statutory authority and was consistent with the district court’s analysis; the same violent and turbulent relationship between the parties that justified extending the protection
                            order prevented the district court from reconciling the visitation terms of the extended protection order with those established in the divorce decree. Saville v. Ude, 2009 ND 211, 776 N.W.2d 31, 2009

                            Amended domestic violence protection order entered against the husband was affirmed because the district court made sufficient findings of actual or imminent domestic violence to support the amended order under N.D.C.C. §

                            Former boyfriend accused of domestic violence had the “full hearing” required by the statute and applicable rules for entering a protection order; although the trial court had discretion under the rules to expand the hearing by allowing more evidence
                            or testimony, if persuaded that it was necessary for the particular dispute, considering the narrow subject of the private dispute between only two people and pro se boyfriend’s failure to follow the rules of evidence, the
                            brevity of the hearing was understandable. Sandbeck v. Rockwell, 524 N.W.2d 846, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 262</cite> (N.D. 1994), overruled in part, Brown v. Brown, 2020 ND 135, 945

                            District court erred in entering a domestic violence protection order enjoining the respondent from having contact with the petitioner and restricting the respondent’s right to possess firearms because the court denied the respondent a full hearing when
                            it issued the order and relied solely on the hearsay in the petitioner’s affidavit and gave the respondent no opportunity to present the respondent’s own relevant evidence or cross-examine the petitioner. Brown v. Brown, 2020

                            District court’s finding of domestic violence was not induced by an erroneous view of the law, nor was the appellate court left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake had been made where a review of the record showed that petitioner presented
                            sufficient evidence for the district court to find domestic violence by recent physical harm and non-consensual sex. Although the court’s findings lacked specificity, the appellate court understood the rationale for the district
                            court’s decision that respondent committed domestic violence given its findings on the record that petitioner testified that respondent choked or threatened to kill her, hit her, had non-consensual sex with her, and petitioner

                    is false and not made in good faith, the court shall order the party making the false allegation to pay court costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the other party in responding to the allegation.

                <p>
                    The court, upon the request of either party or upon its own motion, may appoint a guardian ad litem in an action for a protection order to represent a minor concerning custody, support, or visitation if either party or the court has reason for special
                    concern as to the immediate future of the minor. The guardian ad litem may be appointed at the time of a temporary protection order or at any time before the full hearing. The role of the guardian ad litem consists of investigation
                    and making a recommendation and report to the court. At no time may the involvement of the guardian ad litem alter the requirements set forth in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-07.1s14-07.1-03" target="_self">14-07.1-03</a></cite>.
                    The appointment of the guardian ad litem expires immediately after the full hearing unless the court retains the right, upon specific finding of need, to continue the appointment of a guardian ad litem to participate in visitation.
                    The guardian ad litem shall have access to records before the court except as otherwise provided by law. The court may direct either or both parties to pay the guardian ad litem fees established by the court. If neither party is able
                    to pay the fees, the court, after notice to the state’s attorney of the county of venue, may direct the fees to be paid, in whole or in part, by the county of venue. The court may direct either or both parties to reimburse the county,
                    in whole or in part, for the payment.

                <p>
                    Whenever a protection order is granted under section 14-07.1-02 or 14-07.1-03 and the respondent or individual to be restrained has been served a copy of the order, the first violation of any order is a class A misdemeanor and also constitutes contempt
                    of court. A second or subsequent violation of any protection order is a class C felony. For purposes of this section, “first violation” means the first time any order is violated and a second or subsequent violation of any protection
                    order includes two or more violations of protection orders.

                        The counseling center may deny parental access to private information when the minor, who is the subject of that information, requests that the counseling center deny the access. The counseling center shall provide the minors who seek counseling, treatment,
                        or other assistance from the center with a notification that the minor has the right to request that parental access to private information be denied. The counseling center may require the minor submit a written request that the
                        access be denied. The written request must set forth the reasons for denying parental access and must be signed by the minor.

                            The district court can obtain jurisdiction to compel a husband to support his wife only by service of a summons as in other cases in equity. Bauer v. Bauer, 2 N.D. 108, 49 N.W. 418, 1891 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite>                            (N.D. 1891).

                            District court erred in refusing to address the issue of child support because it had original jurisdiction to enter a child support order in conjunction with the divorce proceeding, superseding the temporary order entered in another district court while
                            the divorce was pending and the parties were still married; by its terms, the temporary child support judgment did not divest the divorce court of jurisdiction to award child support as part of the divorce judgment. Wanttaja

                            District court erred in refusing to address the issue of child support because it had original jurisdiction to enter a child support order in conjunction with the divorce proceeding, superseding the temporary order entered in another district court while
                            the divorce was pending and the parties were still married; by its terms, the temporary child support judgment did not divest the divorce court of jurisdiction to award child support as part of the divorce judgment. Wanttaja

                            Mother seeking reimbursement for child care expenses from non-custodial father need not provide an itemized accounting of all expenses for the child; furthermore, trial court did not err in considering North Dakota’s child support guidelines in determining
                            a reasonable amount of reimbursement. Krug v. Carlson, 2000 ND 157, 615 N.W.2d 564, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 2000).

                            It was necessary to apply the child support guidelines to a case involving an incarcerated obligor; although the father claimed he earned more than minimum wage while in prison, there was no evidence presented at trial indicating his income exceeded minimum
                            wage, and the amount represented the minimum amount of income that could be imputed to the father. St. Claire v. St. Claire, 2004 ND 39, 675 N.W.2d 175, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 47</cite>                            (N.D. 2004).

                            District court erred in failing to include the husband's overseas housing allowance and cost of living allowance in his gross income when calculating his child support obligation as those payments were military subsistence under the child support guidelines.

                            Order for the father to support his child while the child was in foster care was proper where this section imposed a legal obligation to do so, and where his child support obligation was calculated according to the child support guidelines; the father
                            had no legal basis to protest paying support despite his inability to obtain all the records he sought and his dissatisfaction with the services Social Services provided for his son. Berger v. Holt (In re T.H.), 2003 ND 34,

                            Trial court correctly interpreted child support to mean the total grant of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) assistance paid to child’s mother and child, although it found that portions of benefits included special allowances for mother’s
                            transportation to college and day care services paid by her to others while attending college; the whole purpose of the AFDC program is to encourage the care of dependent children in their own homes and assistance need not
                            be spent directly on a child to benefit the child. K.E.N. by Shasky v. R.C., 513 N.W.2d 892, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 1994).

                            the amount expended on their behalf. In view of the public policy which encourages that children be properly cared for, the Supreme Court would be remiss in fulfilling its judicial responsibilities if it held that health insurance

                            Public policy encourages a stepparent to provide support for the spouse’s child, especially if he believes it is his natural child, but if at some time in the future he discovers that the child is not his, then he may be able to recover for the support

                            A husband, upon learning that he was not the natural father of a child born during his marriage, had a valid claim in a civil action against the natural father for support provided the child during the marriage and for expenses incurred in proving nonpaternity.

                            District court abused its discretion in holding a father in contempt because a mother did not allege that any of the provisions of N.D.C.C. ch. 28-21 governing execution and levy were violated, and the circumstances did not amount to an intentional disobedience
                            of a court order under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.27.html#t27c27-10s27-10-01.1" target="_blank">27-10-01.1</a></cite>(1)(c); a district court order merely denied the
                            father’s request for an equitable offset of the parties’ mutual obligations and did not declare that the father was prohibited from using any other available remedies to enforce the mother’s child support obligation. Jordet

                            After the 1997 amendment to this section, all of the father’s ordered, due and unpaid child support obligations constituted judgments by operation of law, regardless of when those obligations became due. Ruscheinsky v. Ulrich, 2000 ND 133, 612 N.W.2d

                            It appears from the legislative history of this section that the legislature intended past-due child support obligations to be treated as judgments under state law. The only distinction between a judgment under this section and a judgment entered by the
                            district court is that the unpaid child support obligations could not be entered in the judgment docket until an order for judgment was obtained from the district court and filed with the clerk of the district court pursuant
                            to Rule 58 of the North Dakota Rules of Civil Procedure. Baranyk v. McDowell, 442 N.W.2d 423, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            As no mention is made in the legislative history regarding interest on judgments for unpaid child support obligations, the legislature intended that judgment interest be determined in the same manner as the judgments entered by the district court; the
                            interest on a judgment is calculated at the rate provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.28.html#t28c28-20s28-20-34" target="_blank">28-20-34</a></cite>. Baranyk v. McDowell,

                    When considering a contempt citation against a child support obligor who is in arrears in child support in an amount greater than three times the monthly child support obligation and the obligor is not current in a court-established plan to repay the
                    unpaid child support arrears, or who has failed, after receiving appropriate notice, to comply with a subpoena relating to a paternity or child support matter, the court shall address and make specific findings on the issue of whether
                    the obligor has or may obtain an occupational, professional, or recreational certificate, permit, or license that the court may withhold or suspend. The court may withhold or suspend any certificate, permit, or license issued by or
                    on behalf of the state or any of its licensing authorities or occupational or professional boards, which the obligor is required to obtain prior to engaging in the obligor’s occupation or profession. The court may withhold or suspend
                    any certificate, permit, or license issued by lottery or by tag by the director of the game and fish department, which the obligor is required to obtain prior to engaging in a recreational activity. Following a decision to withhold
                    or suspend an obligor’s certificate, permit, or license for failure to pay child support, the court shall notify the obligor that the decision becomes final thirty days after the notification unless the obligor satisfies or makes arrangements
                    to pay the entire outstanding payment due. Following a decision to withhold or suspend an obligor’s certificate, permit, or license for failure to comply with a subpoena relating to a paternity or child support matter, the court shall
                    notify the obligor that the decision becomes final unless the obligor complies with the subpoena within a time set by the court. The court shall notify the appropriate licensing authority, occupational or professional board, or the
                    director of the game and fish department of the court’s decision to withhold or suspend an obligor’s certificate, permit, or license. A certificate, permit, or license withheld or suspended by an order issued under this section may
                    be reissued only by order of the court. An appeal by an obligor who has had a certificate, permit, or license suspended under this section is an appeal from the court’s order and may not be appealed to the licensing authority, occupational
                    or professional board, or the director of the game and fish department.

                    license issued under chapter 39-06. The court may restrict or suspend a motor vehicle operator’s license issued by the state which is held by the obligor. The court shall notify the department of transportation of the court’s decision
                    to restrict or suspend an obligor’s motor vehicle operator’s license. An appeal by an obligor who has had a motor vehicle operator’s license restricted or suspended under this section is an appeal from the court’s order and may not

                                Evidence of domestic violence. In determining parental rights and responsibilities, the court shall consider evidence of domestic violence. If the court finds credible evidence that domestic violence has occurred, and there exists one incident of domestic
                                violence which resulted in serious bodily injury or involved the use of a dangerous weapon or there exists a pattern of domestic violence within a reasonable time proximate to the proceeding, this combination creates a
                                rebuttable presumption that a parent who has perpetrated domestic violence may not be awarded residential responsibility for the child. This presumption may be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence that the best
                                interests of the child require that parent have residential responsibility. The court shall cite specific findings of fact to show that the residential responsibility best protects the child and the parent or other family
                                or household member who is the victim of domestic violence. If necessary to protect the welfare of the child, residential responsibility for a child may be awarded to a suitable third person, provided that the person would
                                not allow access to a violent parent except as ordered by the court. If the court awards residential responsibility to a third person, the court shall give priority to the child’s nearest suitable adult relative. The fact
                                that the abused parent suffers from the effects of the abuse may not be grounds for denying that parent residential responsibility. As used in this subdivision, “domestic violence” means domestic violence as defined in
                                section 14-07.1-01. A court may consider, but is not bound by, a finding of domestic violence in another proceeding under chapter 14-07.1.

                            This section is merely a codification of those factors which have always been relevant for consideration by a trial court when determining custody in a divorce dispute and is not a significant departure from the existing case law which has developed throughout
                            the past decade in this state. Lapp v. Lapp, 293 N.W.2d 121, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 238</cite> (N.D. 1980).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is no presumption that it is in the child’s best interests to award custody to the child’s primary caretaker. Dizayee v. Dizayee, 414 N.W.2d 606, 1987 N.D. App. LEXIS 4 (N.D. Ct. App. 1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before a change of custody can be deemed necessary for the best interests of the child, there must be some consideration of the effect of the change on the child. Starke v. Starke, 458 N.W.2d 758, 1990 N.D. App. LEXIS 2 (N.D. Ct. App. 1990).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a modification proceeding, the best interests of the child must be gauged against the backdrop of the stability of the child’s relationship with the custodial parent. Blotske v. Leidholm, 487 N.W.2d 607, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite>                            (N.D. 1992).

                            In an initial child-custody determination, a trial court must decide custody on the best interest and welfare of the child; in determining the best interests of the child, the trial court has substantial discretion, but it must consider and evaluate the
                            factors listed in this section. Severson v. Hansen, 529 N.W.2d 167, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 1995).

                            Father failed to meet his burden of proving the district court’s findings about the child’s maturity were clearly erroneous; the district court found that the child’s preference to live with the father was not a mature child’s preference. Frueh v. Frueh,
                            2009 ND 155, 771 N.W.2d 593, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 166</cite> (N.D. 2009).

                            District court’s finding of fact awarding primary residential responsibility to the wife was not clearly erroneous as the district court expressly considered all of the best interests factors under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1)
                            and made detailed findings of fact on each factor. Seay v. Seay, 2012 ND 179, 820 N.W.2d 705, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 187</cite> (N.D. 2012).

                            District court properly awarded a mother primary residential responsibility of the parties' child because the mother created a more complete positive picture of her present position, likelihood of success, and degree of strengths as a parent than the
                            father, whose allegations of domestic violence lacked credibility and version of events stretched believability, the district court merely found the mother's family provided more support, not that the father's family provided
                            no support, the mother had been rehabilitated since her criminal convictions. Colling v. Behrens (In re R.W.B.C.), 2017 ND 144, 896 N.W.2d 226, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D.

                            In deciding a change of custody motion, if the previous custody placement was based upon the parties’ stipulation and not by consideration of the evidence and court-made findings, the trial court must consider all relevant evidence, including pre-divorce
                            conduct and activities, in making a considered and appropriate custody decision in the best interests of the children. Wetch v. Wetch, 539 N.W.2d 309, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 194</cite>                            (N.D. 1995).

                            When parties to a divorce previously stipulated that it was in the parties’ child’s best interests to remain in a certain city and that any proposal to move the child from that city would be a material change in circumstances warranting modification,
                            and the child’s mother proposed moving the child from that city, it was not clearly erroneous for a trial court to find, in awarding primary residential responsibility to the father, that the best interest factor in N.D.C.C.

                            regarding moving out of state, or (2) place a heavier burden on the mother, but (3) merely gave credence to the parties’ stipulation in finding no evidence showed the child’s best interests required changing the stipulation,
                            nor (4) did the court construe the stipulation to preclude modification, but rather considered relevant evidence leading to the stipulation. Hageman v.

                            the children’s relationship with their parents was one-sided and that the children undeniably had a greater bond with him, the evidence showed that the mother loved the children but was not respected by them because of the
                            father’s encouragement, which included giving the children permission to ignore her, not talk to her, and disobey her. The court found that, although the father claimed to love the children, his conduct damaged the relationship
                            between the mother and their children; the court characterized the father’s love as possessive and mean spirited and found that the emotional ties between the mother and the children were damaged by the father’s conduct. Wolt

                            District court’s order granting the father primary residential responsibility was not clearly erroneous because the mother did not facilitate the relationship between the father and the child; the father had not been provided with an opportunity to create
                            a bond with the child; and the testimony established the mother sought to prevent the child from having a relationship with the child. State v. P.K., 2020 ND 235, 951 N.W.2d 254, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite>                            (N.D. 2020).

                            A trial court’s determinations on matters of child custody are treated as findings of fact. The Supreme Court does not set aside the findings of the trial court on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. Freed v. Freed, 454 N.W.2d 516, 1990

                            A determination of the custody of children is reviewed by the supreme court pursuant to N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) and the court will reverse the custody determination only if it is clearly erroneous or if it believes a mistake has been made. Wolf v. Wolf, 474

                            Simply because the supreme court might view the evidence in a child custody case differently does not entitle the supreme court to reverse the trial court. Schestler v.

                            Appellate courts exercise a limited review of a child custody award in divorce cases and the trial court’s custody determination is a finding of fact that will not be set aside on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous; a finding of fact is clearly erroneous
                            only if it induced by an erroneous view of the law, if no evidence exists to support it, or if the reviewing court, on the entire evidence, is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Neidviecky

                            While the district court did not, as it should have, specifically reference each of the best interest factors in this modification case as they related to the factual findings, the findings were sufficiently detailed to permit the court to understand
                            the basis for the decision; the findings spoke in part to the mother’s inability and the father’s ability to meet the child’s developmental needs and ensure a safe environment, the factors favored the father, and the district
                            court did not err in its application of the best interest factors. Topolski v. Topolski, 2014 ND 68, 844 N.W.2d 875, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            There was evidence of one incident of domestic violence perpetrated by the spouse of a parent, and that incident did not involve serious bodily injury or the use of a dangerous weapon, and thus the presumption could not have been triggered; however, the
                            district court was free to, and did, consider this evidence of domestic violence in its analysis of the best interest factors in this modification case. Topolski v. Topolski, 2014 ND 68, 844 N.W.2d 875, 2014

                            While the district court was required to consider the evidence of the father’s criminal history in this modification case, the district court had substantial discretion regarding the weight to be given to the evidence and the decision of whether to include
                            reference to it in the findings of fact; the district court chose not to give weight to the convictions, this was not clearly erroneous, and the district court did not err in its application of the law regarding consideration

                            District court’s finding that an award of joint residential responsibility was in the child’s best interest was clearly erroneous because the father should have been awarded primary residential responsibility for the child; the district court simply ignored
                            the significant evidence that was favorable to the father and detrimental to the mother. Law v. Whittet, 2014 ND 69, 844 N.W.2d 885, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            and the father had a full time job. Law v. Whittet, 2014 ND 69, 844 N.W.2d 885, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            District court’s finding that factor (1)(d) was equal between the parties was clearly erroneous because the factor favored the father since he had a stable home life, owned his own home, and was engaged to be married, and the father came from a very close
                            and loving extended family; since the parties’ child had been born, the mother had lived in four different residences, and her family life has been dysfunctional. Law v. Whittet, 2014 ND 69, 844 N.W.2d 885, 2014

                            District court did not err by finding that an award of primary residential responsibility to a mother was in the best interest of the children; the appellate court was unable to reassess the credibility of the witnesses, reweigh the evidence, or make
                            new findings of fact. Mairs v. Mairs, 2014 ND 132, 847 N.W.2d 785, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 120</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            District court's finding that a material change in circumstances had occurred since entry of the divorce judgment, thereby justifying a modification of the parenting plan, was clearly erroneous where there was no evidence supporting the finding that the
                            father's hostility toward the mother had negatively impacted the children, and there was no consideration of the best-interest factors under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>                            to justify significantly realigning and expanding the mother's parenting time.

                            Even though a district court incorrectly applied a less stringent standard, modification of primary residential responsibility was not granted because a mother failed to show that the child's present environment endangered her physical or emotional health
                            or impaired the child's emotional development; the child was being cared for in a safe environment while her father was incarcerated. As to the best interest factors, the child excelled in school and had a stable home while
                            in the custody of the father and stepmother, and the mother was directed to pursue the other remedies in the judgment before litigating an issue relating to visitation problems. Sweeney v. Kirby, 2015 ND 148, 864 N.W.2d 464,

                            In a child custody case, a district court erred by finding that a father failed to make a prima facie case that a material change in circumstances existed; a significant change in the father's work schedule was an appropriate consideration in determining
                            whether a prima facie case for modification had been established, and his affidavit set out several of the best interest factors. The father was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and an opportunity to present evidence to support
                            modification of residential responsibility. Ritter v. Ritter, 2016 ND 16, 873 N.W.2d 899, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 2016).

                            with the father's sex offence was relevant in the court's analysis of the child's best interests, the mother provided proper notice of the name-change petition, including physical publication in both counties and mailing notice
                            to the father at the state penitentiary, and the district court allowed the father to appear at the name-change hearing telephonically or through ITV if he made all of the necessary arrangements himself. L.Z.N. v. Narvais,

                            favored neither parent; the district court was concerned about the mother's move with her boyfriend, which was based on evidence showing that the move caused the child's anxiety and behavioral changes; and, although the district

                            and the evidence was replete with the father’s violence, criminal conduct, threats of violence, extreme, hostile, and vulgar language, protection orders, depression, alcohol and substance abuse, and an ongoing pattern of inappropriate

                            advantages of the move would not improve the children’s quality of life; the father’s opposition to the move was valid and not motivated by ill will; the move would have a significant negative impact on the children’s relationship
                            with the father that could not be maintained through longer but less frequent parenting time; and it was in the children’s best interest for the mother to continue to have primary residential responsibility and for the father’s

                            In a custody suit, the burden is on the parent seeking a change in custody to show both a significant change in circumstances and reasons why a change in custody is required for the child’s best interests. Reede v. Steen, 461 N.W.2d 438, 1990

                            The statutory presumption places an emphasis on domestic violence as the paramount factor in a custodial placement when credible evidence of domestic violence appears, and to rebut the presumption, a violent parent must clearly and convincingly prove
                            that some additional circumstances “require” placement of the child with him rather than the non-violent parent. Bruner v. Hager, 534 N.W.2d 825, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 124</cite>                            (N.D. 1995).

                            Where there was a change of circumstances due to, inter alia, former wife’s move to California, and former wife alleged that her former husband’s failure to provide child support caused her residence change and that she had successfully remarried and

                            communications between child and former husband had been denied and disrupted by former wife was not clearly erroneous. Reede v. Steen, 461 N.W.2d 438, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 206</cite>                            (N.D. 1990).

                            A trial court should change custody only if a change in custody is necessary or required for the best interests of the child; while those best interests are to be determined from considering the statutory factors in this section, the process of weighing
                            those factors must be gauged against the backdrop of the stability of the child’s relationship with the custodial parent. Barstad v. Barstad, 499 N.W.2d 584, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 62</cite>                            (N.D. 1993).

                            Where the father had failed to comply with the terms of the original custody arrangement, frequently disallowed exercise of the mother’s visitation rights, and attempted to willfully alienate the minor children from the mother, a change in custody in
                            favor of the mother was necessary to promote the best interests of the children. There was evidence to indicate that the father took advantage of the mother’s language limitations by convincing her the judgment indicated that
                            he should have custody weekdays and holidays, and the findings made it clear that the father attempted to disrupt and deny the mother’s contact with the children, actions detrimental to their best interests. Roberson v. Roberson,

                            Because a motion for change of custody and a countermotion to change the residence of the child are inseparable and intermingled, the trial court correctly concluded that when motion to change custody was granted, the other was effectively denied. McDonough

                            In deciding custody under a best interests of the children standard, the district court did not err in finding that factor k favored the mother because, while it was true that the mother had no definite plans for her intended move, she intended to move
                            both because of employment opportunities, having received multiple job offers, and to be closer to her family. While the mother may not have been certain about where she would relocate, her testimony reflected that she was
                            deciding between a small number of locations based upon specific job offers, and all of the potential locations would bring the children much closer to members of their extended family. Pember v. Shapiro, 2011 ND 31, 794 N.W.2d

                            Trial court failed to recognize the continuous and uninterrupted relationship important to the children since the divorce. The marginal advantages of a change in custody must be weighed against uprooting a child from an established custodial arrangement.

                            In a change in custody proceeding, it is the continuity of the custodial parent-child relationship that is critical, not the continuity of the stepparent-child relationship.

                            Finding that child was a normal, healthy, happy, six-year-old child who loved her mother and who got along well in school belied the contradictory finding that maintaining the current continuity was not desirable; the trial court’s finding that the child
                            had not been in a stable environment minimized the overriding significance of the continuous and uninterrupted relationship that has been important to child’s development as the happy, well-adjusted child the trial court found
                            child to be i.e., her relationship to her custodial parent; therefore, the district court’s findings were clearly erroneous. Blotske v. Leidholm, 487 N.W.2d 607, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 167</cite>                            (N.D. 1992).

                            Because of the importance accorded custodial stability and continuity, courts in modification proceedings must weigh the statutory best-interest factors against the backdrop of the stability of the child’s relationship with the custodial parent. Lovin

                            The available legislative history indicates an intent that the trial judge not only consider domestic violence but make written findings regarding the effect of such abuse upon custody or visitation; failure to do so could be a basis for reversal. Schestler

                            The existence of domestic violence is one factor that the court must consider under this section, in making its custody decision. It is an important factor, but so are other required factors that the court considered in making its decision. Schestler

                            In amending subdivision (1)(j) to create a presumption that a parent who has committed domestic violence may not be awarded custody of a child, the legislature placed the burden of proof on the perpetrator to prove that the best interest of the children
                            require that the perpetrator be a custodial parent. Heck v. Reed, 529 N.W.2d 155, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1995).

                            tax exemption favoring him were threats of future conduct and did not denote immediacy so as to place the mother in fear of harm occurring without delay. Thus such threats did not constitute domestic violence which would require
                            visitation restrictions. Lawrence v. Delkamp, 2000 ND 214, 620 N.W.2d 151, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 258</cite> (N.D. 2000).

                            several reasons, including the desire to avoid the prejudicial effect of a finding of domestic violence in child custody arrangements. Frisk v. Frisk, 2005 ND 154, 703 N.W.2d 341, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite>                            (N.D. 2005).

                            Trial court improperly relied upon father’s social-worker witness to assess trial testimony as an expert on father’s violent conduct, because the trial court cannot delegate its specific statutory responsibility to weigh the evidence and make findings

                            Where the record showed that the trial court had before it substantial evidence about the parents and the child, and their emotional, psychological, and factual conditions, parent denied custody did not show that following remand the trial court acted
                            in an arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconscionable manner when it declined to grant his requests to submit additional evidence he alleged rebutted statutory presumption against awarding custody to perpetrator of domestic violence,
                            and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant his motions to submit new evidence, which would have merely been cumulative. Bruner v. Hager, 547 N.W.2d 551, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 127</cite>                            (N.D. 1996).

                            Two acts by parent, committed seven years ago, neither involving serious bodily injury, nor suggesting a pattern of domestic violence, did not constitute domestic violence requiring court to invoke presumption against parent’s custody. Dinius v. Dinius,

                            Evidence of a single incident in which the father had pushed the mother and broken the door of the apartment where the mother was staying was not sufficient to trigger the statutory presumption against granting custody to a violent parent. Reeves v. Chepulis,

                            Where evidence of domestic violence is insufficient to trigger the statutory presumption against granting custody to a violent parent, the domestic violence evidence is still considered as one of the best interest factors under subsection (1). Reeves

                            Evidence that husband inflicted serious bodily injury on the wife when she was pregnant which included bruising her eye and arms and tearing hair from her head while trying to remove her wedding ring was sufficient to trigger the domestic violence presumption.

                            Though the evidence of domestic abuse presented did not trigger the rebuttable presumption under this section, such evidence was sufficient for the trial court to make a finding that domestic abuse had occurred and appropriately considered it in determining
                            the children’s best interests, where evidence showed that wife obtained two adult protection orders as a result of the abuse and husband wrote a letter apologizing to her for the abuse in one of the incidents. Hurt v. Hurt,

                            In order to establish a presumption against custody, allegations of sexual abuse must show a pattern of abuse occurring within a reasonable time close to the hearing, or the abuse must involve serious bodily injury or use of a weapon. Selzler v. Selzler,

                            the parties’ children through disciplinary measures was insufficient to trigger the domestic violence presumption against awarding custody to the father; because the domestic violence presumption was not met, the court properly
                            gave factor (j) equal consideration with the other applicable factors under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1) when determining

                            the trial court did not err in finding that the mother did not commit an act of domestic violence sufficient to trigger the presumption that disfavored an award to one who committed domestic violence because the mother’s alleged

                            The trial court’s findings should not merely minimize a violent parent’s conduct without making specific findings about that conduct, but the extent of the evidence of physical abuse must be specifically addressed and dealt with in the findings. Owan

                            A trial court cannot dismiss violent behavior merely because it was instigated by non-violent behavior, and excuse instances of domestic violence by a parent perpetrated because the court found it was provoked by the other parent’s actions. Huesers v.

                            District court should address evidence of domestic violence even if it finds the evidence is not credible, or is significantly less than the amount inflicted by the other parent. Owan v. Owan, 1997 ND 50, 560 N.W.2d 900, 1997

                            Where a trial court addresses whether evidence of domestic violence triggers the presumption against awarding custody, it is required to make specific and detailed findings regarding the effect the allegations of violence have on the presumption. Holtz

                            of domestic violence was rebutted by the same factors that necessitated a change in custody, the court’s findings were affirmed. Holtz v. Holtz, 1999 ND 105, 595 N.W.2d 1, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite>                            (N.D. 1999).

                            Where the record showed both parents had engaged in acts of domestic violence against each other, but none of the acts resulted in serious bodily injury, the district court did not err in finding the rebuttable presumption against awarding custody to
                            a perpetrator of domestic violence was not triggered in this case. Brown v. Brown, 1999 ND 199, 600 N.W.2d 869, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 1999).

                            Trial court did not commit clear error in finding that Factor J—evidence of domestic violence—favored neither party and in rejecting the father’s contention that the mother had committed a pattern of domestic violence against him and the children. While
                            the mother had a strained relationship with her two older children and while there was one incident in which the mother held the oldest of her three children down, the incident occurred more than a year before trial, the mother
                            contended that she held her child down because he was out of control, and the incident did not constitute domestic violence because the mother did not inflict a serious injury upon the child and did not use a dangerous weapon.

                            the basis for its decision. The district court’s findings addressed only one incident of domestic violence and contained no specific or detailed findings regarding that incident. Datz v. Dosch, 2013 ND 148, 836 N.W.2d 598,

                            District court erred in awarding primary residential responsibility and decision-making authority to a father because, despite the testimony offered at trial—the father shot a gun into the air during the squabble between the mother and a child and testimony
                            that the father repeatedly used corporal punishment as a form of discipline—was evidence that domestic violence may exist, the district court did not explain why domestic violence was not one of the factors it considered in
                            deciding primary residential responsibility when there was credible evidence in the record that domestic violence may exist. Carlson v.

                            Given the evidence of a pattern of abusive behavior on father’s part throughout his relationship with mother, and given the fact the father had not sought treatment for his abusive tendencies, the trial court did not err in finding that the statutory
                            presumption against awarding custody operated against the father despite the passage of time since the last incident of abuse between the parties. Krank v. Krank, 541 N.W.2d 714, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 19</cite>                            (N.D. 1996).

                            The mere separation of the parents was an insufficient basis for the court to support a custodial placement with the father on a finding that the cause for the father’s acts of domestic violence had been eliminated by the separation. Engh v. Jensen, 547

                            Placement of joint custody was clearly erroneous, where trial court found domestic violence triggered statutory presumption against one parent, and where evidence violence would not occur again or was not directed at children and that other parent was
                            over-protective failed to clearly and convincingly rebut presumption why sole custody with other parent was not in children’s best interest. Zuger v. Zuger, 1997 ND 97, 563 N.W.2d 804, 1997

                            Insufficient evidence presented to trigger the rebuttable presumption against awarding custody to a perpetrator of domestic violence where the trial court found no dangerous weapons were ever used by the parties, no serious bodily injury occurred, and
                            the incidents were remote in time from the mother’s motion for sole custody. Tulintseff v. Jacobsen, 2000 ND 147, 615 N.W.2d 129, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 2000).

                            District court's consideration of domestic violence erred because (1) the record disclosed several incidents, but the court focused on one incident, finding the incident did not give rise to the presumption in N.D.C.C. §

                            District court erred because it balanced the domestic violence factor against other best interests factors without first determining whether the presumption had been raised and, if raised, rebutted with clear and convincing evidence, and it treated a
                            child's maintaining a relationship with both parents as not just a factor but a predominant best interests factor. O'Hara v. Schneider, 2017 ND 53, 890 N.W.2d 831, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite>                            (N.D. 2017).

                            Where finding that defendant’s violence had created a rebuttable presumption that it would not be in children’s best interest to place them in defendant’s custody, the trial court did not err in finding that the statutory presumption was rebutted after
                            determining that defendant had never directed violence toward the minor children, that defendant had a “more stable home environment,” and that there was more love and affection between defendant and the children than existed

                            were insufficient for the presumption in subdivision (1)(j); the acts inflicted no actual injury, were isolated and remote in time, and were viewable as demonstrative. Ryan v. Flemming, 533 N.W.2d 920, 1995

                            The court’s finding of “violence” by defendant created a rebuttable presumption that it would not be in the minor children’s best interests to place them in defendant’s custody. Under N.D.R.Ev. 301(a), that presumption continues until the trier of fact
                            finds from credible evidence that the fact presumed does not exist. Schestler v. Schestler, 486 N.W.2d 509, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1992).

                            Because judicial notice was taken of a domestic violence protection order proceeding, a district court should have decided if two alleged sexual assaults constituted domestic violence under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1)(j),

                            domestic violence and other mental and physical abuse, was rebutted; district court misapplied the law in failing to consider this factor in its decision to change custody of three children from a former wife to the former
                            husband. Laib v. Laib, 2008 ND 129, 751 N.W.2d 228, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 135</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            Plaintiff failed to overcome the presumption that he not be awarded primary residential responsibility of the parties' three children due to domestic violence. In light of the domestic violence factor's paramount nature and the difficult burden plaintiff
                            had to overcome, the district court did not clearly err in awarding defendant primary residential responsibility. Gagnon v. Gagnon, 2017 ND 67, 891 N.W.2d 742, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite>                            (N.D. 2017).

                            When the evidence does not demonstrate a clear showing of domestic violence, but rather, demonstrates a showing of actions which may or may not be within the domestic violence definition, the party attempting to raise the presumption must do so at the
                            trial court level, and not wait to raise the issue when the case is on appeal. Ternes v. Ternes, 555 N.W.2d 355, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            finding indicated that it was not asked to consider the father’s argument, and the court therefore could not consider the issue on appeal, plus the father identified no other evidence suggesting that the trial court erred in
                            not finding sufficient evidence of domestic violence, such that the trial court’s finding that the evidence was insufficient to affect the determination of parental rights was not clearly erroneous. Morris v. Moller, 2012 ND

                            This section reflects the public policy that a perpetrator of domestic violence is generally not a proper person to have custody and the presumption against awarding that parent custody of the children may be overcome only by compelling circumstances.

                            The legislature did not intend that the presumption against awarding custody of children to a perpetrator of domestic violence be trumped by the fact that the victim-parent smokes; a trial court, concerned about the ill effects of secondhand smoke upon
                            an asthmatic child, should first prohibit the nonperpetrating parent who smokes from smoking or allowing others to smoke in the presence of the child. Heck v. Reed, 529 N.W.2d 155, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite>                            (N.D. 1995).

                            The legislature intended not only that domestic violence committed by a parent weigh heavily against the parent’s claim for child custody, but that it be overcome only by clear and convincing evidence that the best interests of the children demand that
                            the perpetrator of domestic violence serve as custodial parent. Heck v. Reed, 529 N.W.2d 155, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite> (N.D. 1995).

                            Trial court cannot treat the rebuttable presumption of subdivision (1)(j) as simply another factor to be weighed with the remaining best-interest factors; a finding that the father provided a more stable environment was insufficient to overcome the finding
                            that the father had been a perpetrator of domestic violence. Engh v. Jensen, 547 N.W.2d 922, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            Although the trial court is not required to make a separate finding on each statutory factor, the court’s findings should be stated with sufficient specificity so that reviewing court can understand the factual basis for its decision. Severson v. Hansen,

                            Trial court’s findings that child’s psychological and emotional health substantially outweighed the stability with his custodial parent and thus compelled change of custody were not clearly erroneous. McDonough v. Murphy, 539 N.W.2d 313, 1995

                            Order regarding custody of child was incomplete and not a final award, because the award did not contain a reference to the basis for the trial court’s decision or demonstrate it was based upon the best interests of the child, and the order appeared provisional
                            and contained references to a future order. Fahlsing v. Teters, 552 N.W.2d 87, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            Although a separate finding was not required for each factor under this section, the trial court erred when it failed to make any findings of fact regarding its child custody determination, and since N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) was not complied with, it was impossible
                            for the reviewing court to determine whether the trial court’s determination of custody of the child was clearly erroneous. Huntress v. Griffey, 2002 ND 160, 652 N.W.2d 351, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 212</cite>                            (N.D. 2002).

                            When the record showed that the trial court considered the wife’s unemployment, the husband’s better ability to provide the child with guidance, and the behavioral problems of the wife’s children from other marriages, the trial court properly decided
                            to award custody to the husband. Krank v. Krank, 2003 ND 146, 669 N.W.2d 105, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                            Neither the memorandum opinion nor the findings of fact evaluated the evidence presented to the trial court in a best interests of the child analysis and when the trial court provided no indication of the evidentiary and theoretical basis for its decision,
                            the appellate court was left to speculate whether factors were properly considered and the law was properly applied under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>;

                            evidence in the record supported the district court’s findings of fact, including its ultimate finding that the best interests of the children would be better served by awarding custody to the husband. Koble v. Koble, 2008

                            best interests as there was no evidence that the father refused to pay the ordered child support or that he was late with his payments; the father’s support obligation was presumed to be the correct amount of support. Frueh

                            District court’s findings on the best interest factors and custody were not clearly erroneous as the record included evidence indicating the child adjusted well when custody was transferred to the father, he was thriving in the father’s care, and was
                            at the time of trial a happy, healthy, normal six-year-old child. Hartleib v. Simes, 2009 ND 205, 776 N.W.2d 217, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 217</cite> (N.D. 2009), overruled in part,

                            and had relationships with at least 5 men, the findings of fact were insufficient to allow for a meaningful review of whether a custody change would have served the best interest of the child. For example, insufficient findings
                            were made on a claim of alienation, a claim of domestic violence, and the ability of each parent to provide a safe environment. State v. Neustel, 2010 ND 216, 790 N.W.2d 476, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite>                            (N.D. 2010).

                            the court failed to consider the stability of the relationship between the child and the mother, that the child was presumed to be better off with the custodial parent, and that close calls should be resolved in favor of continuing

                            Trial court’s award of primary residential responsibility for a child to the child’s mother was clearly erroneous because (1) the court’s findings were insufficient to discern a factual basis for the findings, as findings related to the best interest

                            Frustration of visitation does not alone constitute a sufficient change in circumstances to warrant a change in custody. Before visitation problems justify changing custody, there must be a finding that the visitation problems had worked against the child’s

                            Where the factors included in this section weighed virtually equal between both parents, trial court did not err in ordering joint custody given that the evidence did not favor one parent over the other. Peek v. Berning, 2001 ND 34, 622 N.W.2d 186, 2001

                            Trial court’s decision to grant physical custody to the father was not clearly erroneous and paternal grandmother’s testimony that she would not continue to provide childcare should custody be granted to the mother did not constitute emotional blackmail
                            precluding an award of physical custody to the father. Corbett v. Corbett, 2001 ND 113, 628 N.W.2d 312, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2001).

                            Where the trial court carefully considered the relevant factors under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1) to make a custody award in the child’s best interests
                            and, in essence, found both parents were fit to provide for the child’s care, but that the father was overall the better choice to have primary physical custody of the child, the trial court did not clearly err in awarding
                            the father custody of the parties’ child. L.C.V. v. D.E.G., 2005 ND 180, 705 N.W.2d 257, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 214</cite> (N.D. 2005).

                            District court did not err by awarding physical custody of two minor children to their father after finding that the factors under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1)(d),
                            (e), (m) favored him. The mother had spent very little time with the children due to military service, there was no evidence of her daily interaction with the children, the district court was permitted to consider the children’s
                            relationship with extended family, and the children were bonded to a nearby relative who cared for them for four years; moreover, an award to either party would have implicated grandparents since both parties resided with their
                            respective parents. Eifert v. Eifert, 2006 ND 240, 724 N.W.2d 109, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 250</cite> (N.D. 2006).

                            Contrary to the father’s claim, the plain language of the stipulated judgment reflected there was no initial custody determination in the case, and the court thus properly analyzed the case under the best interests factors in N.D.C.C. §

                                the child, and the court recognized that any of the obvious distance disadvantages of the mother’s move to Arizona could be alleviated with an appropriate visitation schedule. Jelsing v. Peterson, 2007 ND 41, 729 N.W.2d

                            Trial court did not commit clear error in finding that Factor B—the parents’ capacity and disposition to give the child love, affection, and guidance and to continue the child’s education—favored the mother because the trial court’s finding was based
                            on the testimony of several witnesses, including the child’s teacher, who testified that the mother had arranged tutoring for the child, and the child’s daycare provider, who testified that, since the separation, the child
                            was happy, well-adjusted, and showed an increase in self-esteem. Dronen v. Dronen, 2009 ND 70, 764 N.W.2d 675, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D. 2009).

                            Trial court did not commit clear error in finding that Factor H—the child’s home, school, and community record—favored the mother and in rejecting the father’s argument that a home with him on the family farm was a more satisfactory environment because
                            the child’s teachers testified that his demeanor and behavior was the same after the child moved in with his mother as it was before the separation, the child was even more involved in activities than he had been when he lived
                            on the farm with both parents, the child liked living in town with his mother, and the child received academic assistance from tutors since moving into town. Dronen v. Dronen, 2009 ND 70, 764 N.W.2d 675, 2009

                            Trial court did not commit clear error in finding that Factor A—the love, affection, and emotional ties between the parents and child—favored the mother because the child’s emotional ties seemed to be stronger with the mother. The child wanted to go and
                            live with his mother when she left the marital home, and the record revealed that the trial court heard the testimony of witnesses and reviewed the custody investigator’s report before concluding that the child had a greater
                            emotional attachment to the mother at the time of trial and before the mother and father separated. Dronen v. Dronen, 2009 ND 70, 764 N.W.2d 675, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 83</cite> (N.D.

                            Trial court’s decision to award physical custody of the children to a husband was not clearly erroneous because the husband was favored on all of the best interest factors set forth under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1),

                            District court did not err in awarding primary residential responsibility of the parties’ minor children to the father where the mother’s plan to move out of the country, find a new job, and live with a new boyfriend and the child they had together would
                            have been more disruptive than staying with the father; the mother’s plans were based entirely on what the mother felt was best for the mother’s own personal life and not the lives of the mother’s children. Marsden v. Koop,

                            mother was reluctant to promote visitation between father and child and because, although the mother believed that the child had been abused, she refused to follow recommendations to get the child counseling. The child needed
                            to be with a parent who would provide her with the opportunity to obtain the counseling that had been recommended; although the mother said that she would do anything to help her child, her actions did not appear to bear that

                            Trial court did not clearly err in awarding primary residential responsibility of the parties’ minor children to the mother because the evidence showed: (1) the mother had been primarily involved in the education of the children, as she enrolled them
                            school and sports; (2) the mother was the primary caretaker and had primary residential responsibility of the children from September 2008 until the interim order in March 2009; (3) the mother had been involved in a stable
                            and loving relationship with her husband since September 2008; (4) the father was unemployed; and (5) the mother’s report of sexual abuse of one child by the father was made in good faith. The court could not conclude that
                            the mother engaged in the type of willful alienation and frustration of parenting time that would preclude her from having primary residential responsibility by picking up the children early from day care and showing up at
                            the father’s house 20 minutes before her scheduled pick-up time to take the children. Doll v. Doll, 2011 ND 24, 794 N.W.2d 425, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 29</cite> (N.D. 2011).

                                the findings of fact and conclusions of law was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable; the court made specific findings for each of the factors under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>,

                            when the court found the father would provide greater continuity and stability due to the mother’s potential relocations, the court found the mother’s likely move would have an adverse impact on the children, and the court
                            found no potential negative impact by any new romantic partners of the divorcing parents. Deyle v. Deyle, 2012 ND 248, 825 N.W.2d 245, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 257</cite> (N.D. 2012).

                            District court’s decision to award the father primary residential responsibility for the children was not clearly erroneous because it did not misapply the law or improperly rely on the father’s acquittal in criminal proceedings, and the mother’s claim
                            that the decision was based on the district court’s mistaken finding that she fabricated the propofol and sexual assault claims was asking the court to reassess the witnesses’ credibility, reweigh the evidence, and make new
                            findings of fact, which was beyond the court’s scope of review. Norberg v. Norberg, 2014 ND 90, 845 N.W.2d 348, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 80</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            District court did not err in awarding primary residential responsibility of the children to the mother because the best interest factors were for the most part, equal for both parents; the evidence supported the decision to keep the children together;
                            the father would be able to maintain his close relationship with his son with a liberal parenting plan; the oldest children, who were about 14 and 17 at the time of the court’s decision, preferred to live with the mother; and
                            the mother and the two oldest children did not want to continue the interim plan of the week-on, week-off parenting schedule. Schlieve v. Schlieve, 2014 ND 107, 846 N.W.2d 733, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 107</cite>                            (N.D. 2014).

                            Trial court did not err in granting the parents equal residential responsibility after considering the factors in this section, and finding that most factors favored neither parent, the parents were able to communicate with each other, and the parents
                            believed time with the other parent was important. State v. Andres, 2016 ND 90, 879 N.W.2d 464, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 2016).

                            District court did not err in awarding the mother primary residential responsibility because, prior to the parties’ separation and after, the mother was the primary parent who provided daily care for the child; the father’s work caused him to be away
                            from home most of the week; at the time of trial, the father continued to wear an ankle monitor as a condition of probation for his most recent offenses; the father’s prior violence and aggression, as well as his black-out
                            drunk episodes, were concerning; and the father perpetrated acts of domestic violence toward the mother in 2013 and 2017. Dick v. Erman, 2019 ND 54, 923 N.W.2d 137, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 47</cite>                            (N.D. 2019).

                            Where the mother was granted custody of the parties’ children upon divorce and the father filed a motion to obtain custody over his son alleging domestic violence and incidents involving children’s stepfather did constitute evidence of domestic violence

                            Although the right of a parent to the custody of his child is not absolute, the court is reluctant to remove the child from the parent’s custody unless it is necessary to prevent serious detriment to the welfare of the child; in a divorce action, an award
                            of custody to the grandparents rather than to one or both of the child’s natural parents is clearly erroneous unless the court makes findings of fact that there exist exceptional circumstances which require such a custody disposition

                            did not reverse the trial court’s custody determination, because under the trial court’s analysis, consideration of the statutory factors overwhelmingly favored the wife. Reineke v. Reineke, 2003 ND 167, 670 N.W.2d 841, 2003

                            Trial court did not commit clear error in finding that Factor I—the child’s preference—favored the mother and in rejecting the father’s contentions that the child was not of an age, intelligence, or understanding to express a preference. While the child
                            was only 10 years of age and may not have been able to express a mature preference for either parent, the trial court found that the child’s reasons for wanting to live with his mother were thoroughly expressed by the custody

                            Parties’ children were ten years old, nine years old and three years old; the district court properly disregarded the parties’ testimony about the children’s preference because the children were too young to express a reasonable preference. Lindberg v.

                            Trial court did not err in finding that factor (i) favored the mother because, although two of the three children expressed a desire to live with their father, the father engaged in deliberate conduct designed to alienate the children from their mother,
                            and the court doubted the children’s maturity and questioned whether they understood how they had been manipulated by the father. When they expressed to the court their desire to live with their father, their testimony plainly
                            reflected the district court’s concern that they did not fully comprehend their poor treatment of their mother, simply stating that she was either mean or did not allow them to do what they wanted to do. Wolt v. Wolt, 2010

                            District court’s award of parenting time to the father, as well as the summer arrangement it implemented, was not clearly erroneous because the best interest factor that gave weight to the preferences of a mature child favored the father, and the district
                            court reasonably implemented guidelines to help the mother and father work out his parenting time. Conzemius v. Conzemius, 2014 ND 5, 841 N.W.2d 716, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite>                            (N.D. 2014).

                            District court's determination to take into account the children's preferences was not clearly erroneous where the children were 17, 14, and nearly 13, they were sufficiently mature to make a sound judgment, and they had each expressed a desire to live
                            with the mother. Thompson v. Thompson, 2018 ND 21, 905 N.W.2d 772, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 2018).

                            In case where transfer of child custody was sought, Supreme Court declined to give presumptive weight to one parent’s role as primary caretaker, although recognizing the primary caretaker role inheres in the statutory factors to be considered in each
                            case. Von Bank v. Von Bank, 443 N.W.2d 618, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            While the Supreme Court has declined to adopt a presumption that it is in the child’s best interest to award custody to a primary caretaker, being a child’s primary caretaker is a relevant factor for determining custody. Dinius v. Dinius, 448 N.W.2d 210,

                            Where the trial court did not embellish on each of the statutory factors to be considered in determining the best interests, and thus the custody, of the children of the parties, but its decision followed rather closely the recommendations in a custody
                            evaluation report prepared by a licensed psychologist in which each of the statutory factors was discussed, the trial court clearly did not impermissibly rely on the “primary caretaker” factor to the exclusion of all others
                            in awarding custody to mother. Wolf v. Wolf, 474 N.W.2d 257, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. 1991).

                            to continue living in the “stable, satisfying environment” of her home, the trial court did not err in focusing on her primary caretaker status and considering its substantial impact on the children’s best interests. Foreng

Freed v. Freed, 454 N.W.2d 516, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite>                            (N.D. 1990).

                            Where the trial court indicated strong doubts about father’s past alcohol problems and lack of continuing treatment, but recognized that placing custody of son with mother would be unproductive due to their strained relationship and son’s strong preference
                            for remaining with his father, and where the case contained several circumstances lessening any negative effect of a split-custody determination, including a fairly large age difference between the children, the fact that son
                            was relatively close to the age of emancipation, the fact that father’s residence and mother’s were only a few miles apart, and the rather liberal visitation granted by the court, the trial court did not act improperly in splitting
                            custody of the children between the parents. Freed v. Freed, 454 N.W.2d 516, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1990).

                            District court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant a longer continuance after deciding to hear case as an original custody decision, because parties had no right to rely on interlocutory custody order or judgment which was void because its
                            entry was not directed by the court, and because they should have been prepared to present evidence regarding child’s best interests whether action was an original custody determination or an action to modify custody. Fahlsing

                            Neither the statutes nor their legislative history indicate a priority for domestic violence over other statutory factors that the court is required to consider in deciding the delicate issue of child custody. Schestler v. Schestler, 486 N.W.2d 509, 1992

                            The standard for deciding child custody in a divorce case is “the best interests and welfare of the child.” In applying that standard, the trial court must consider the “best interests” factors enumerated in this section, and should, according to the
                            majority view of this court, give equal weight to each relevant factor. Swanston v. Swanston, 502 N.W.2d 506, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite> (N.D. 1993).

                            The trial court carefully weighed every fact under subsection (1) of this section in determining custody, when it carefully weighed the issues of education, a lack of trust and communication between the parties, and the presumption concerning domestic
                            violence. Coons v. Coons, 2003 ND 115, 665 N.W.2d 60, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 119</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                            Judgment awarding a father physical custody of the parties minor child was affirmed because the district court did not clearly err in analyzing the best interests factors under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>.
                            Evidence supported district court’s finding that various factors either favored neither party or favored the father. Bernhardt v. Harrington, 2009 ND 189, 775 N.W.2d 682, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 204</cite> (N.D.

                            Because the evidence established that the mother was the child’s primary caretaker prior to his parents’ separation, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that stronger emotional ties existed between the mother and child and that factor
                            (a) favored that primary physical custody be awarded to her. Heinle v. Heinle, 2010 ND 5, 777 N.W.2d 590, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 2010).

                            to enroll the child in preschool and talked to the child in an age appropriate manner about the parties’ divorce. Heinle v. Heinle, 2010 ND 5, 777 N.W.2d 590, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite>                            (N.D. 2010).

                            took care of the child’s needs prior to the parties’ separation, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that she was more disposed to do so in the future as well. Heinle v. Heinle, 2010 ND 5, 777 N.W.2d 590, 2010

                            District court did not clearly err in finding that factor (f) favored custody by a child’s mother because the district court found no evidence that the mother was morally unfit to care for the child, but the father’s failure to disclose information about
                            his income and annual monetary gifts from his father reflected poorly on his moral character. Heinle v. Heinle, 2010 ND 5, 777 N.W.2d 590, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D. 2010).

                            District court clearly erred in finding that factor (g) favored custody by a child’s mother because the district court applied a double standard to the parties, finding that the mother’s emotional response to the divorce was normal but that the father’s
                            emotional response signaled mental health issues. Where both parties were found to have cried at times due to the impending divorce, it was clear error for the district court to concluded that the mother was of superior mental
                            health, and the appellate court would not permit the district court to perpetuate a damaging stereotype based upon gender. Heinle v. Heinle, 2010 ND 5, 777 N.W.2d 590, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite>                            (N.D. 2010).

                            District court clearly erred in finding that factor (j) favored custody by a child’s mother because the district court found that neither party had been physically violent with each other. That the father had called the mother a “bitch” and threatened
                            her did not constitute domestic violence sufficient for factor (j) to weigh in favor of the mother. Heinle v. Heinle, 2010 ND 5, 777 N.W.2d 590, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 5</cite> (N.D.

                            family in the Bismarck area, living with their father would allow them to live in the area where they had lived all of their lives and thus provide them with continuity and stability, and living with their father would promote
                            the children’s well-being, as they were doing very well in their father’s home. Fleck v. Fleck, 2010 ND 24, 778 N.W.2d 572, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 2010).

                            Trial court did not err in finding that factor (b) favored the mother because, although both mother and father had the capacity to continue the children’s education, the father demonstrated neither the capacity nor the disposition to give the children
                            true and unselfish love and affection. The court found that the father had severely damaged the children and that, based on his conduct in alienating the children from their mother, the children would not allow their mother
                            to show them the love and affection she has for them. Wolt v. Wolt, 2010 ND 26, 778 N.W.2d 786, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 22</cite> (N.D. 2010).

                            Although the parenting investigator’s conduct, in which he said “good job” only to the mother, was concerning, the court could not find that the trial court erred in awarding primary residential responsibility to the mother just because it paralleled
                            the investigator’s recommendation; the trial court conducted its own analysis of the best interest factors in reaching its conclusion, the father brought to the trial court’s attention what he saw to be biased conduct, the

                            A “career mother” is not disqualified for custody of her children any more than a working father, but where each parent works outside of the home and where each has the ability and desire to care for their children, the trial court must necessarily weigh
                            the circumstances on the fine and delicate scale. The trial court may consider “any other factors…relevant to a particular child custody dispute.” Landsberger v. Landsberger, 364 N.W.2d 918, 1985

                            After the parties divorced, the trial court did not err in awarding primary residential responsibility to the wife because the husband’s proposed parenting plan of alternating every seven days would be too disruptive during the school year; there was
                            no evidence that the trial court was motivated by gender bias, and the fact that the husband had held a variety of jobs with differing work schedules was an appropriate consideration. The court found no difference on best interest
                            factors under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1)(d), (e), (f), and (h), because both parties had a sufficient home for the child,
                            were willing and had the ability to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and child, and both parties testified to taking an interest in the child’s schooling. Hammeren v. Hammeren,

                            It is proper to consider the clarifying language of the 1997 amendment to subdivision (1)(j) as a guide to determine whether pre-amendment conduct was domestic violence invoking the presumption, and it is error for a trial court to refuse to consider

                            far less controlling, mother had demonstrated a willingness to facilitate children’s relationship with father while father had not demonstrated a similar willingness to foster the children’s relationship with their mother.

                            Where the trial court ordered studies of the home facilities available to the child with his grandparents and his mother, and also gave the parties an opportunity to introduce at the hearing any additional evidence which they desired the court to consider
                            in making its custody redetermination, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the grandparents’ request for an investigation and report under this section. Patzer v. Glaser, 396 N.W.2d 740, 1986

                            For a trial court to use a home studies report, it should be made a part of the evidentiary record; nevertheless, a parent desiring to challenge a statutory report on custodial arrangements should take some action to contradict it. Thorlaksen v. Thorlaksen,

                            District court erred in considering witness “testimony” in the form of affidavits and erred to the extent that its custody decision cited those affidavits and to the extent that it may have relied upon those affidavits in the making of the custody decision,
                            as N.D.R.Civ.P. 43 (a) generally required oral testimony and trial and did not permit trial testimony by affidavit. However, the error was harmless because the record reflected that the district court’s custody decision relied
                            primarily upon the information and recommendation contained in the court-ordered parenting investigation report under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.3" target="_self">14-09-06.3</a></cite>.

    Appointment of guardian ad litem or investigator for child in proceedings involving parental rights and responsibilities — Immunity.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    In any action for an annulment, divorce, legal separation, or other action affecting marriage, when either party has reason for special concern as to the future of the minor child, and in any action when the parenting rights and responsibilities concerning
                    the child is contested, either party to the action may petition the court for the appointment of a guardian ad litem to represent the child concerning parenting rights and responsibilities. The court may appoint a guardian ad litem
                    or investigator on its own motion. If appointed, a guardian ad litem shall serve as an advocate of the child’s best interests. If appointed, the investigator shall provide those services as prescribed by the supreme court. The court
                    may direct either or both parties to pay the guardian ad litem or investigator fee established by the court. If neither party is able to pay the fee, the court may direct the fee to be paid, in whole or in part, by the county where
                    the child resided at the time the action was commenced. The court may direct either or both parties to reimburse the county, in whole or in part, for such payment. Any guardian ad litem or investigator appointed under this section
                    who acts in good faith in making a report to the court is immune from any civil liability resulting from the report. For the purpose of determining good faith, the good faith of the guardian ad litem or investigator is a disputable
                    presumption.

                            retainer. Peters-Riemers v. Riemers, 2002 ND 72, 644 N.W.2d 197, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1195, 123 S. Ct. 1252, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1031, 2003

                            In litigation over a father’s visitation rights, where the mother requested independent representation of the parties’ children on the grounds that the children needed independent representation because the trial court asked the children to submit their
                            own suggested visitation schedule and also denied her request to appoint a guardian ad litem, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to allow independent representation for the parties’ children, as there
                            are no statutes or court rules that permit an attorney to represent a minor child in custody and visitation without a formal appointment by the Court. The Supreme Court noted, however, that when a trial court requests the children
                            prepare their own response to a visitation schedule, perhaps the trial court should consider the merits of appointment of a guardian ad litem to assist in the preparation of the response on behalf of the children. Negaard v.

                            The trial court erred in imposing residency restrictions beyond the parties’ stipulation without first giving them notice and an opportunity to present relevant evidence on the issue. Aanderud v. Aanderud, 469 N.W.2d 154, 1991

                            Because there was no notice to the parties that the trial court would go beyond their stipulation as to child’s residency, and because the record contained no evidence to demonstrate that the absence of a residency restriction would be harmful to the
                            child or to show why the restriction was necessary to promote the child’s best interests, the residency restriction imposed by the court, although well intended, was a clearly erroneous restriction and was set aside. Aanderud

                            has been furnished to the child by any person. Larson v. Dunn, 474 N.W.2d 34, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 143</cite> (N.D. 1991).

                            Trial court did not clearly err in finding that a change in custody was the only remaining option despite expert testimony that counseling and back-up child care could minimize the parentification of the two older siblings, given that the mother rejected
                            back-up child care as a solution and her fibromyalgia was incurable meaning that the parentification could not be halted with any degree of certainty thus rendering counseling ineffective. Mayo v. Mayo, 2000 ND 204, 619 N.W.2d

                            Although the trial court made several findings recounting how the mother had persistently interfered with the father’s visitations since the child’s birth, it was not clear whether such actions were based upon an intentional plan of interference, or whether
                            they related to a degree of selfishness and/or overprotectiveness. Thus, the trial court properly decided it was in the child’s best interest to remain with the child’s mother, but with extensive visitation with the child’s
                            father in Utah, and with the warning that any future interference with visitation would result in a change of custody. Sweeney v. Sweeney, 2002 ND 206, 654 N.W.2d 407, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite>                            (N.D. 2002).

                            Where the father had failed to comply with the terms of the original custody arrangement, frequently disallowed exercise of the mother’s visitation rights, and attempted to willfully alienate the minor children from the mother, a change in custody in
                            favor of the mother was necessary to promote the best interests of the children. There was evidence to indicate that the father took advantage of the mother’s language limitations by convincing her the judgment indicated that
                            he should have custody weekdays and holidays, and the findings made it clear that the father attempted to disrupt and deny the mother’s contact with the children, actions detrimental to their best interests. Roberson v. Roberson,

                            Although a mother moved to modify, within two years of the original judgment, child custody arrangements so that she could relocate her children from Wyoming to California, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that there was no basis for changing
                            custody of the children to the father. After examining relevant factors, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that the move was in the children’s and the custodial family’s best interests, the move was not being done
                            for malicious reasons, and increased visitation would ease some of the negative impact of the move. Frieze v. Frieze, 2005 ND 53, 692 N.W.2d 912, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D.

                            In an action where a change of custody was required under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(6) due to a material change in circumstances, which was the beginning
                            of the child’s education, the trial court did not err in finding that there had been domestic violence by the father against the mother as defined in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-07.1s14-07.1-01" target="_self">14-07.1-01</a></cite>(2)
                            and in finding that the domestic violence presumption statute, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1)(j), dictated that the mother should be granted custody of
                            their child with the father having visitation. Thompson v. Olson, 2006 ND 54, 711 N.W.2d 226, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 71</cite> (N.D. 2006).

                            In a child custody modification proceeding where a mother retained sole physical custody in the children’s best interests, a district court properly applied the factors set out in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1)
                            in determining that the parents were unable to cooperate or communicate and that a step-mother was primarily responsible for the conflict; the district court’s weighing of the conflicting evidence was not clearly erroneous.

                            Parties’ cross-motions for modification of residential responsibility authorized the district court to decide primary residential responsibility, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>,
                            but its findings on the best interests of the children, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(1), were inadequate to understand the rationale of the court’s decision
                            to award primary residential responsibility to the mother. Haroldson v. Haroldson, 2012 ND 44, 813 N.W.2d 539, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 44</cite> (N.D. 2012).

                            Order granting a father’s motion to modify custody was proper because modification was necessary to serve the best interest of the child under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(6);
                            the trial court found that the mother failed to provide the child with a stable home environment and she persistently frustrated the father’s parenting time. Vining v. Renton, 2012 ND 86, 816 N.W.2d 63, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite>                            (N.D. 2012).

                            Modification of child custody was in the children’s best interests because the court found that the mother’s lack of residential stability affected the children’s ability to develop long-term home, school, and community records, and the court found that
                            the interaction of the children with others in the parent’s household favored the father. Kartes v. Kartes, 2013 ND 106, 831 N.W.2d 731, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 2013).

                            District court erred in granting the father’s motion to change primary residential responsibility for their minor child from the mother to the father because the district court failed to engage in any meaningful analysis under the best-interest factors.

                            In this modification case, there was evidence that both parties violated the judgment, and thus the district court had to decide whether evidence of frustration of parenting time constituted a change in material circumstances, and the district court erred
                            in concluding evidence of the mother’s failure to communicate and lack of cooperation, even if proved, could not constitute such a material change. Regan v. Lervold, 2014 ND 56, 844 N.W.2d 576, 2014

                            Record contained clear evidence of new facts that were not known at the time of the prior custody decree which supported that a material change in circumstances had occurred, including evidence of four child welfare reports and two social services assessments,
                            and the finding that a material change in circumstances did not occur was clearly erroneous and induced by an erroneous view of the law. Regan v. Lervold, 2014 ND 56, 844 N.W.2d 576, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite>                            (N.D. 2014).

                            While the district court did not, as it should have, specifically reference each of the best interest factors in this modification case as they related to the factual findings, the findings were sufficiently detailed to permit the court to understand
                            the basis for the decision; the findings spoke in part to the mother’s inability and the father’s ability to meet the child’s developmental needs and ensure a safe environment, the factors favored the father, and the district
                            court did not err in its application of the best interest factors. Topolski v. Topolski, 2014 ND 68, 844 N.W.2d 875, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            There was evidence of one incident of domestic violence perpetrated by the spouse of a parent, and that incident did not involve serious bodily injury or the use of a dangerous weapon, and thus the presumption could not have been triggered; however, the
                            district court was free to, and did, consider this evidence of domestic violence in its analysis of the best interest factors in this modification case. Topolski v. Topolski, 2014 ND 68, 844 N.W.2d 875, 2014

                            While the district court was required to consider the evidence of the father’s criminal history in this modification case, the district court had substantial discretion regarding the weight to be given to the evidence and the decision of whether to include
                            reference to it in the findings of fact; the district court chose not to give weight to the convictions, this was not clearly erroneous, and the district court did not err in its application of the law regarding consideration
                            of pre-divorce conduct of the parties. Topolski v. Topolski, 2014 ND 68, 844 N.W.2d 875, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            Court should have first analyzed the statutory best interest factors before denying a father's motion to modify residential responsibility; if the father's motion was denied, the court should have then analyzed the factors in Stout v. Stout, 1997 ND 61,
                            560 N.W.2d 903, and Hawkinson v. Hawkinson, 1999 ND 58, 591 N.W.2d 144, with regards to a mother's motion to relocate. Seay v. Seay, 2015 ND 42, 859 N.W.2d 398, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 38</cite>                            (N.D. 2015).

                            District court did not clearly err in not considering the mother's intention to relocate in analyzing the father's motion to modify primary residential responsibility where the mother's relocation motion was filed after the father's motion, the mother
                            stated that she would not move if the father was awarded primary residential responsibility, and the father suggested that the mother's motion be heard at a later date. Larson v. Larson, 2016 ND 76, 878 N.W.2d 54, 2016

                            It was error to deny an evidentiary hearing on a mother’s motion to modify primary residential responsibility because the mother’s affidavits showed, prima facie, modification was in the children’s best interest, as (1) the father and the father’s new
                            wife argued and allegedly had a poor relationship with the children, showing modification was necessary to prevent the children’s emotional damage, and (2) the father’s affidavits contradicting the mother’s affidavits did not
                            conclusively show the mother was not entitled to modification. Heidt v. Heidt, 2019 ND 45, 923 N.W.2d 530, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 2019).

                            District court did not err in denying a father’s motion to modify primary residential responsibility where it explicitly found neither parent had any significant moral failings that would have impacted the children, and from that finding the court ostensibly
                            believed the mother’s explanation that almost two years before the father’s motion she inadvertently left a bottle in her car with one prescription pill for her gastrointestinal pain, and the district court’s findings that
                            four factors favored the mother were not induced by an erroneous view of the law and evidence existed to support those findings. Purdy v. Purdy, 2019 ND 75, 924 N.W.2d 118, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite>                            (N.D. 2019).

                            While the district court properly awarded equal residential responsibility and shared parenting time to a child’s parents, it erred by including an “automatic” change of custody provision that purported to modify its original residential responsibility
                            decision without consideration of the child’s best interests at the time of a potential move because the court’s provisions essentially sought to control a future determination on primary residential responsibility, regardless
                            of when the mother’s “imminent” relocation would occur. Woelfel v. Gifford, 2020 ND 197, 948 N.W.2d 814, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 2020).

                            mathematical calculation from the affidavits of the time spent with the child did not establish a change of primary physical care. Also, the mother’s use of the word “usually” did not clearly reflect how often the child stayed
                            with her; thus, there was not sufficient evidence of a change of primary physical care to meet the prima facie requirement under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(4)

                            The word “finds” in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(4) reflects a degree of weighing of conflicting evidence, and the word “justifying” reflects “to show to
                            be just or right;” in view of the statutory language, and consistent with the legislative history, the North Dakota Supreme Court’s review of the denial of an evidentiary hearing on change of custody will be under an abuse-of-discretion
                            standard. To the extent that Tank v. Tank, 2004 ND 15, 673 N.W.2d 622 (2004), and Hawley v. LaRocque, 2004 ND 215, 689 N.W.2d 386 (2004), established a de novo review of a denial of an evidentiary hearing, they are superseded.

                            Where mother alleged in her affidavit that the father had attended only a few post-divorce counseling appointments with the child and wanted to cancel the remaining appointments, that he procrastinated and often failed to take care of the child’s medical,
                            optometric, and dental needs, that he allowed the child to stay up too late and made him eat breakfast at school instead of at home, that he discussed the court proceedings with the child, that he had police officers accompany
                            him to her house to pick up the child, and that he “wrestled” with his girlfriends in front of the child, the mother’s assertions did not create prima facie evidence that the child’s living environment with the father could
                            endanger his physical or emotional health or impair his emotional development. Also, the mother did not provide a basis for her claimed knowledge about various claimed incidents or what exactly the claimed incidents entailed,
                            and her remaining allegations did not present a prima facie case for modification of child custody; thus, the district court did not err in denying the mother an evidentiary hearing on her motion to modify child custody. Lagro

                            District court should have granted a father an evidentiary hearing in a custody case because he established a prima facie case for modification under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>                            based on a mother’s relocation within a state, allegations of abuse, the mother’s remarriage and entry into a medical residency program, and the children’s preference. In considering whether a prima facie case was established,
                            the district court was not allowed to weigh the conflicting allegations. Dietz v. Dietz, 2007 ND 84, 733 N.W.2d 225, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2007).

                            for the motion to change custody is not necessary. Therefore, on remand, a district court was permitted to consider whether an evidentiary hearing under N.D.R.Ct. 8.2(d) should have been ordered where a father was seeking an
                            interim custody order. Dietz v. Dietz, 2007 ND 84, 733 N.W.2d 225, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2007).

                            Father had presented sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case for modification of child custody warranting an evidentiary hearing, because the father alleged that the twelve-year-old child wanted to live with him and that the mother’s spouse
                            had physically abused the child, and an affidavit and a handwritten letter from the child were included with the father’s motion, expressing his wishes to live with the father and that he had been abused by the mother’s spouse.

                            the time since the original judgment, that the father went nine months without seeing the child, and that the mother’s living conditions had improved while the father’s had declined, was sufficient to establish a prima facie

                            Where a husband and wife divorced and stipulated that the wife would have primary residential responsibility for the couple’s children, where the husband moved three years later to change primary residential responsibility to himself, and where the husband
                            alleged that the wife had twice attempted suicide--once in the presence of the children--and that such constituted a material change in circumstances, the district court erred in denying an evidentiary hearing and erred in
                            concluding that the husband failed to establish a prima facie case for modification of primary residential responsibility because the husband’s affidavit included competent first-hand knowledge of the wife’s suicide attempts
                            and thus established a prima facie case of changed circumstances that would justify a modification of primary residential responsibility if proved at an evidentiary hearing. Schumacker v. Schumacker, 2011 ND 75, 796 N.W.2d

                            court should not have denied the mother’s motion to amend a second amended judgment that alleged a change in circumstances. The mother essentially alleged that the parties’ actual circumstances were different than reflected
                            in that judgment and although the trial court could deny the mother’s motion without an evidentiary hearing pursuant to N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(4) if

                            Father was entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he established a prima facie case justifying modification of primary residential responsibility based on a material change in circumstances; inter alia, the father alleged that the mother had been
                            in abusive relationships and had attempted suicide. Because a mother’s counter-affidavits did not conclusively establish that the father’s allegations had no credibility, trial court could not weigh or resolve conflicts when
                            determining if a prima facie case had been established. Charvat v. Charvat, 2013 ND 145, 835 N.W.2d 846, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 2013).

                            It was error to deny a father seeking a modification of primary residential responsibility an evidentiary hearing because the district court's conclusory finding that the father did not meet the N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(6)
                            best interest element was inadequate, as the finding addressed no allegations in the father's affidavits that the mother interfered with parenting time, amounting to parental alienation, denied the father's right of first refusal
                            for parenting time, and unilaterally decided to enroll the parties' child in occupational and play therapy, nor did the court find the father's allegations were not supported by competent evidence, that the wife's counter-affidavits
                            conclusively established the father's allegations had no credibility, or that the father's allegations were facially insufficient to justify modification. Hankey v.

                            to an evidentiary hearing. Although the district court's rationale for its ultimate determination that the father failed to present a prima facie case justifying a modification of residential responsibility was unclear, its
                            reasoning showed it weighed the conflicting evidence and engaged in an impermissible “mini-trial by affidavit,” relying on the mother's affidavits to weigh and resolve conflicts. Grigg v. Grigg, 2015 ND 229, 869 N.W.2d 411,

                            It was error to deny an evidentiary hearing on a mother’s motion to modify primary residential responsibility because the mother’s affidavits showed a prima facie material change in circumstances, as (1) the father, with whom the children lived, had remarried,
                            (2) the father’s new spouse and three other children were added to that household, which was stressful for the children due to the father’s arguing with the father’s wife, (3) two children no longer wanted to live with the
                            father, and (4) a disfavored sibling separation was possible. Heidt v. Heidt, 2019 ND 45, 923 N.W.2d 530, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 43</cite> (N.D. 2019).

                            Even though a district court incorrectly applied a less stringent standard, modification of primary residential responsibility was not granted because a mother failed to show that the child's present environment endangered her physical or emotional health
                            or impaired the child's emotional development; the child was being cared for in a safe environment while her father was incarcerated. As to the best interest factors, the child excelled in school and had a stable home while
                            in the custody of the father and stepmother, and the mother was directed to pursue the other remedies in the judgment before litigating an issue relating to visitation problems. Sweeney v. Kirby, 2015 ND 148, 864 N.W.2d 464,

                            Mother made a prima facie case for modification of primary residential responsibility, warranting an evidentiary hearing. The mother’s affidavit was competent because it was based on her first-hand knowledge and provided factual support for the conclusion
                            a persistent and willful denial or interference with parenting time existed. Sweeney v. Kirby, 2013 ND 9, 826 N.W.2d 330, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 9</cite> (N.D. 2013).

                            To modify child custody a court must consider whether there is a significant change of circumstances since the original custody decree and, if so, whether this change compels or requires the court to change custody to serve the best interests of the child.

                            Even if the court knew at the time the divorce decree was entered that a child’s needs would change as she grew older, this did not foreclose the trial court from finding a material change of circumstances where a mother’s mental limitations and inability
                            to cope with and parent her growing child led to the conclusion that the child’s environment endangered her physical or emotional health or impaired her emotional development, since as a matter of law that amounted to a material
                            change of circumstances that warranted a change of custody. Holtz v. Holtz, 1999 ND 105, 595 N.W.2d 1, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1999).

                            When a trial court entertains a motion to change custody of children, the judge must determine whether or not there has been a significant change in circumstances since the original divorce decree and custody award and, if so, whether or not those changed
                            circumstances compel or require a change in custody to foster the best interests of the children. Hendrickson v. Hendrickson, 2000 ND 1, 603 N.W.2d 896, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 1</cite>                            (N.D. 2000).

                            evidence that father and his parents were primary care givers and that mother (who had custody) was pregnant by another man failed to establish a material change in circumstance. Braaten v. J.G. (In the Interest of K.M.G.),

                            Order changing custody from mother to father was not clearly erroneous where evidence existed that the mother had repeatedly frustrated the father’s visitation, attempted to alienate the child from his father, refused to cooperate with social services,

                            to father was not clearly erroneous and was based on an analysis of significant change in circumstances compelling a change of custody and the best interests of the child. Anderson v. Resler, 2000 ND 183, 618 N.W.2d 480, 2000

                            Given that the trial court considered testimony and reports submitted by each of three psychologists and gave each the weight it deemed appropriate, it’s finding that parentification of the oldest child and the possibility of the parentification of the
                            second oldest child constituted a material change in circumstances justifying a modification in custody was not clearly erroneous. Mayo v. Mayo, 2000 ND 204, 619 N.W.2d 631, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 245</cite>                            (N.D. 2000).

                            a significant change in circumstances that supported modification of child custody under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>. Kelly

                            request for modification of custody under subsection (6) of this section did not establish a material change of circumstances; no evidence showed the mother drank in the children’s presence, she provided for the children and

                            Where the evidence showed that a mother had been unemployed and residing with her parents for three years, had numerous arrests, and had a secret marriage that lasted one month, a change in custody was properly granted under N.D.C.C. §

                            Father’s motion to modify custody based on a move was properly denied without an evidentiary hearing because he did not establish a prima facie case under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>                            since permission to relocate to another state was granted in a prior unappealed order.

                            Referee properly found that there was a material and significant change of circumstances warranting modification of custody because the rotating custody arrangement was no longer workable, as evidenced by the parties’ lack of cooperation and their subsequent
                            competing motions to amend the original judgment to provide for sole physical custody of the children. Clark v. Clark, 2006 ND 182, 721 N.W.2d 6, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite>                            (N.D. 2006).

                            Where the mother was granted custody of the parties’ children upon divorce and the daughter moved in with the father after witnessing a domestic dispute involving her stepfather, the trial court erred by denying the father’s motion for custody of his
                            son; the new split-custody arrangement appeared to be a material change in circumstances for purposes of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(6).
                            Furthermore, although evidence of domestic violence did not rise to the level necessary to trigger the presumption of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>, it nevertheless
                            could serve as evidence of a material change of circumstances supporting a modification of custody under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>. Niemann v. Niemann,

                            Although the noncustodial parent had remarried, quit abusing alcohol, and provided a good environment for the children when they came to visit him, in order to constitute a material change in circumstances, the improvements in the noncustodial parent’s
                            situation had to be accompanied by a decline in the condition of the children with the custodial parent over the same period of time. There was no decline in the condition of the children with the custodial parent, so the district
                            court properly found that there was no material change in circumstances. Stanhope v. Phillips-Stanhope, 2008 ND 61, 747 N.W.2d 79, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 61</cite> (N.D. 2008).

                            Where the parties agreed to joint child custody in North Dakota, the trial court did not err by granting the father’s motion for a change of custody under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>                            so that he could move the children to Wyoming; the trial court was correct in deciding that the father’s move to Wyoming to accept a new job was a material and significant change in circumstances requiring modification of child
                            custody. The trial court analyzed the best interests of the children and found that two factors, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(d), (e), favored the father;

                            and had relationships with at least 5 men, the findings of fact were insufficient to allow for a meaningful review of whether a custody change would have served the best interest of the child. For example, insufficient findings
                            were made on a claim of alienation, a claim of domestic violence, and the ability of each parent to provide a safe environment. State v. Neustel, 2010 ND 216, 790 N.W.2d 476, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 220</cite>                            (N.D. 2010).

                            Court properly changed child custody because there had been a significant change in circumstances including that the wife had persistently denied the husband visitation, the children were behind in their schooling, the children had been isolated, and
                            the husband had remarried and had a stable home. Woodward v. Woodward, 2010 ND 143, 785 N.W.2d 902, 2010 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 2010).

                            District court did not err in denying a father’s motion to modify custody because a single altercation in which the mother took the son’s cell phone away from him in disciplining him was an isolated incident that did not amount to domestic violence sufficient
                            to constitute a material change of circumstances under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(6). Under N.D.C.C. § 12.-05-05(1), a parent
                            could use reasonable force upon a minor for the purpose of safeguarding or promoting the minor’s welfare, including prevention and punishment of the minor’s misconduct and the maintenance of proper discipline. Lechler v. Lechler,

                            fact that this language was not used, where the trial court focused on a mother’s move, an improvement in a father’s stability, the mother’s relationships, a gun incident, and a domestic assault. Although several of the best
                            interest factors favored the mother, a residential change was proper where the primary considerations that outweighed custodial stability and the continuity of the mother were the presence of a man who had abused her, the mother’s
                            refusal to terminate that relationship, and her failure to realize how her relationships impacted her children. Glass v. Glass, 2011 ND 145, 800 N.W.2d 691, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 2011).

                            District court, which denied a father’s request to modify the primary residential responsibility of his minor child with the child’s mother, did not clearly err in determining no material change in circumstances had occurred. Testimony regarding whether
                            the mother was properly feeding the child was contradictory and lacked independent corroboration. Frison v. Ohlhauser, 2012 ND 35, 812 N.W.2d 445, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 35</cite>                            (N.D. 2012).

                            testified the cat had been gone for several months, and the mother testified that she cleaned her home to the best of her ability after the cat was removed. Frison v. Ohlhauser, 2012 ND 35, 812 N.W.2d 445, 2012

                            allegations that, even if found to be true, did not establish a prima facie case; the alleged frustration of visitation had not yet occurred, and some information the mother provided to prove the children were distraught were

                            In a child custody case, a district court erred by finding that a father failed to make a prima facie case that a material change in circumstances existed; a significant change in the father's work schedule was an appropriate consideration in determining
                            whether a prima facie case for modification had been established, and his affidavit set out several of the best interest factors. The father was entitled to an evidentiary hearing and an opportunity to present evidence to support
                            modification of residential responsibility. Ritter v. Ritter, 2016 ND 16, 873 N.W.2d 899, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 3</cite> (N.D. 2016).

                            District court did not find it was aware of the drug and alcohol use or domestic abuse when it entered the prior order establishing primary residential responsibility; rather, the district court found there was not a material change because the information
                            was known to the parties at the time of the prior order. However, the district court misapplied the law and failed to consider relevant pre-divorce conduct because a material change in circumstances was determined by facts
                            which were unknown to the court at the time of the prior order, not facts that were unknown to the parties. Haag v. Haag, 2016 ND 34, 875 N.W.2d 539, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite>                            (N.D. 2016).

                            mother; the district court was not aware that the father used alcohol and drugs or that he was abusive to the mother when it entered the prior order establishing equal residential responsibility of the child; and the district
                            court misapplied the law by determining there was not a material change in circumstances because the parties were aware of that information at the time of the divorce, as the standard was what the district court was aware of
                            at the time of the divorce. Haag v. Haag, 2016 ND 34, 875 N.W.2d 539, 2016 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 39</cite> (N.D. 2016).

                            District court did not err in requiring that the mother prove a material change in circumstances in order to change primary residential responsibility for the child where a judgment incorporated the parties' stipulation that the father was to have primary
                            residential responsibility, that judgment had been incorporated into an order, and thus, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(6) required
                            the mother to prove both that a material change in circumstances had occurred since that order and that modification was necessary to serve the child's best interests. Valeu v. Strube, 2018 ND 30, 905 N.W.2d 728, 2018

                            suffered during the marriage did not constitute domestic violence. Valeu v. Strube, 2018 ND 30, 905 N.W.2d 728, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 4</cite> (N.D. 2018).

                            Where the fourth amended judgment in a divorce matter was an order establishing custody and because the father did not allege any of the grounds listed under subdivision (5) of this section as a basis for modification, there was no error in finding his
                            motion to change custody was barred by the two-year moratorium. Wagaman v. Burke, 2002 ND 51, 642 N.W.2d 178, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 49</cite> (N.D. 2002).

                        <p>
                            Because the father’s motion to modify custody was brought within two years of the amended judgment, which was like an order denying a custody modification, the amended judgment resulting from a 2004 motion to modify custody was “an order establishing
                            custody” of all three children within the meaning of the statute and the district court therefore should have applied the stricter modification standard of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(5).

                            Although the analysis was similar, the trial court, and the parties, mistakenly applied N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>(6), which provided limitations on post-judgment
                            child custody modifications, to a husband’s motion to modify visitation. Simburger v. Simburger, 2005 ND 139, 701 N.W.2d 880, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 2005).

                            Supreme Court of North Dakota believes that if the legislature had intended that visitation modification should be subject to the same requirements as custody modification under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>,
                            it would have explicitly included the term “visitation modification” in the statute. Therefore, the court is of the opinion that modification of visitation is not governed by N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite>.

                            District court mistakenly applied N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.6" target="_self">14-09-06.6</a></cite> where mother sought to modify visitation and challenged the court’s mandate of supervised
                            visitation for two years. Once an initial custody decision has been made, visitation modifications are governed by a different statute, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-22" target="_self">14-05-22</a></cite>(2).

                            including the requirement that the movant establish a prima facie case prior to entitlement of an evidentiary hearing. Helfenstein v. Schutt, 2007 ND 106, 735 N.W.2d 410, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 105</cite> (N.D.

                        <p>
                            Court erred in ruling the mother was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing for failing to establish a prima facie case for modification, because the mother did not move to modify primary residential responsibility, but rather, she moved to modify parenting
                            time, and a parent moving for modification of parenting time under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-05s14-05-22" target="_self">14-05-22</a></cite> was not required to establish a prima

                            Denial of the father’s request for modification was proper, as the district court’s failure to find willful or intentional interference by the mother with the father’s parenting time with the parties’ child was not clearly erroneous, as the father presented
                            no evidence establishing that access to the child via video communication four days a week rather than seven was an intentional interference with his parenting time and the mother asserted the change was made because daily
                            contact proved to be too much for the child, who was mostly nonverbal. Stoddard v. Singer, 2021 ND 23, 954 N.W.2d 696, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 20</cite> (N.D. 2021).

                            If a trial court did not modify the parties’ equal custody arrangement, child support had to be calculated under the offset procedure set out in N.D. Admin. Code § 75-02-04.1-08.2, but if the trial court found a significant change in circumstances such
                            that the equal custody provision had to be amended, child support had to be calculated under N.D. Admin. Code § 75-02-04.1-02. Boumont v. Boumont, 2005 ND 20, 691 N.W.2d 278, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite>                            (N.D. 2005).

                            In a case where a father sought to modify primary residential responsibility, appellate review was hampered by a district court's failure to make specific, detailed findings; the district court did not address any of the allegations in the father's affidavit,
                            even though he specifically alleged a health hazard to the children. The mother did not submit a counter-affidavit to dispute the allegations or to conclusively establish that the father's allegations had no credibility. Brooks

                            District court erred in denying a mother’s motion to modify residential responsibility of the parties’ minor children where it misapplied the law by concluding that a domestic violence finding in a prior protection order proceeding required application
                            of the domestic violence presumption in the instant proceeding. Dickson v. Dickson, 2018 ND 130, 912 N.W.2d 321, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 141</cite> (N.D. 2018).

                            The best interests of the child is the primary issue in deciding whether or not a change in residence of the child should be permitted; custodial parent is not required to show “exceptional circumstances” in order to be allowed to remove child from the
                            state of residence of the noncustodial parent. Burich v. Burich, 314 N.W.2d 82, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 354</cite> (N.D. 1981).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial court has the principal responsibility for determining when a change of residence is in the children’s best interests. Where the trial court has fairly done so, the Supreme Court will not substitute its judgment. Hedstrom v. Berg, 421 N.W.2d
                            488, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The preference of the child is one factor the trial court may consider in determining the best interests of the child in the context of a motion to remove the child from the state; the preference of a mature child is particularly significant. Keller v.
                            Keller, 1998 ND 179, 584 N.W.2d 509, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 186</cite> (N.D. 1998).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court’s finding that the custodial mother’s proposed move was in the child’s best interest was supported by evidence that mother had obtained a higher paying job in another locale, the move would provide her with greater job opportunities in the
                            field in which she held a degree, and the move was not to defeat the father’s visitation. Olson v. Olson, 2000 ND 120, 611 N.W.2d 892, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 126</cite> (N.D. 2000).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evidence of mother’s past unreasonable behavior regarding father’s visitation with their son, including one incident where she was held in contempt of court for refusing a scheduled visit between the two, was sufficient for trial court to refuse to allow
                            mother to move with son to Montana, potentially creating more visitation enforcement problems. Hentz v. Hentz, 2001 ND 69, 624 N.W.2d 694, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 2001).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            District court did not clearly err in concluding that relocation to another state was not in the best interests of the parties’ child where the mother’s employment opportunities out-of-state were equal to those in-state, the testimony about the cost of
                            living out-of-state was found not credible, and the child would have spent less time with the father and extended family. Moreover, the evidence supported the findings that the move was premised in part upon an effort to limit
                            the father’s parenting time and that the mother’s proposed parenting time for the father would not have allowed him to preserve and foster his relationship with the child. Norby v. Hinesley, 2020 ND 153, 946 N.W.2d 494, 2020

                            Burden of proof is on custodial parent to show removal of child from this state is consistent with child’s best interests, considering the prospective advantages of the move in improving custodial parent’s and child’s quality of life, the integrity of
                            custodial parent’s motive for relocation and noncustodial parent’s motive for opposing the move, and the opportunity for visitation to preserve and foster noncustodial parent’s relationship with child. Stout v. Stout, 1997

                            The burden of securing an order for a change in residence of a child is upon the custodial parent. Burich v. Burich, 314 N.W.2d 82, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 354</cite> (N.D. 1981).

                            Where a trial court approved a change of residence for the children so that they could accompany their mother with a new husband and balanced negative aspects of the move by scheduling six weeks of summer visits by the children with their father at his

                            Trial court erred in denying a mother’s motion to change the residence of the parties’ children from North Dakota to Missouri, where, although it found that the mother had satisfied the relevant factors to be considered in determining a relocation request,
                            it erroneously held that the parties’ decree-incorporated stipulation, which automatically transferred custody of the children to the father if the mother were transferred out of the state, was the law of the case. Zeller v.

                            While it is not appropriate for a district court to consider the Stout-Hawkinson factors alone when a parent requests permission to relocate with the children and the existing custody award is for joint physical custody, the district court did not err
                            in considering those factors after first concluding that sole custody by the mother was in the children’s best interests and then addressing the mother’s motion to relocate. Pember v. Shapiro, 2011 ND 31, 794 N.W.2d 435, 2011

                            parent with primary residential responsibility. The statute does not require a parent change his or her legal residence to eliminate the need for a court order, only that a parent move outside the state to a location more than
                            50 miles from the parent with primary residential responsibility. Eggers v. Eggers, 2015 ND 65, 860 N.W.2d 824, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 70</cite> (N.D. 2015).

                            motive for relocation, 3) The integrity of the noncustodial parent’s motive for opposing the move, and 4) Whether there is a realistic opportunity for visitation if relocation is allowed. State ex rel. L.F.F. v. K.D.M. (In

                            Where the trial court made findings that the custodial mother has a proper motive for moving out of state, and that the court could restructure visitation to preserve the father-child relationship, the trial court’s denial of the move on the grounds that
                            it was not in the child’s best interests was clearly erroneous. Paulson v. Bauske, 1998 ND 17, 574 N.W.2d 801, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 6</cite> (N.D. 1998).

                            District court abused its discretion in denying mother’s motion to relocate the children out of state after her new husband accepted a new job which would provide the family with improved quality of life and enable the mother to extend the time she spent

                            In properly denying a mother’s motion to change the residence of the mother’s minor children from North Dakota to Illinois, evidence supported the trial court’s finding that the mother’s motive for the move was to deter and defeat the father’s visitation.

                            When the father moved more than 50 miles away from the mother and child before entry of the divorce decree, the mother was not required to obtain a court order or written permission from the father before changing the residence of their child; under subdivision
                            (2) of this section, the time of the father’s move is not relevant. Ralston v. Ralston, 2003 ND 160, 670 N.W.2d 334, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                            Although a mother moved to modify, within two years of the original judgment, child custody arrangements so that she could relocate her children from Wyoming to California, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that there was no basis for changing
                            custody of the children to the father. After examining relevant factors, the trial court did not clearly err in finding that the move was in the children’s and the custodial family’s best interests, the move was not being done
                            for malicious reasons, and increased visitation would ease some of the negative impact of the move. Frieze v. Frieze, 2005 ND 53, 692 N.W.2d 912, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 58</cite> (N.D.

                            wife did not show that there were non-economic advantages to the children residing in New Mexico after she finished her education there and, moreover, the purpose of the relocation was to frustrate visitation. Dvorak v. Dvorak,

                            Because there was no evidence that travel expense was a factor, the district court misapplied the fourth Stout-Hawkinson factor finding it did not favor the mother’s relocation but, the court’s findings on factor one, specifically the lack of advantages
                            and benefits to the family regarding the proposed move, supported its decision to deny the mother’s relocation to Arizona. Graner v. Graner, 2007 ND 139, 738 N.W.2d 9, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 139</cite>                            (N.D. 2007).

                            Where the parties agreed to joint child custody in North Dakota, the trial court did not err by granting the father’s motion to relocate under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-07" target="_self">14-09-07</a></cite>                            so that he could move the children to Wyoming; the trial court was correct in deciding that the father’s move to Wyoming to accept a new job was a material and significant change in circumstances requiring modification of child
                            custody. The trial court analyzed the best interests of the children and found that two factors, N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.2" target="_self">14-09-06.2</a></cite>(d), (e), favored the father;

                            Judicial referee properly denied a mother's request, pursuant to to relocate to Minnesota with the parties' younger child because, while the referee considered the prospective advantages of the move, it was not in the child's best interests where the
                            school system and extracurricular activities in Minnesota did not offer a greater advantage to the child, the mother's commute to work and school would require her to be away from the child for an extended period of time each

                            Trial court’s finding that mother failed to substantiate the economic advantages to moving out of state was clearly erroneous where mother produced specific evidence of financial benefits resulting from new out-of-state job and she testified there were

                            District court, pursuant to this section, has authority to award child support payments to plaintiff in a default judgment for divorce and child custody where plaintiff’s divorce complaint contains a prayer for child custody even though it contains no
                            prayer for child support. Mathisen v. Mathisen, 276 N.W.2d 123, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 1979).

                            Unwillingness to pay, without more, cannot be a valid reason for the trial court’s refusing to order child support payments or for reducing the amount of such payments.

                            The trial court’s order that a father pay $ 300 per month in child support was not clearly erroneous, where he testified that he could afford to pay $ 200 per month in child support and that, at the time of trial, he was sending $ 100 per month to his
                            son who was attending college. Hanson v. Hanson, 404 N.W.2d 460, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 298</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                            Child support award was not excessive since husband had a significantly higher monthly income than wife and since the addition of $ 400 to wife’s monthly income did little more than enable wife to maintain a comparable standard of living for their child

                            Although trial courts have continuing jurisdiction to modify stipulations in which the parties agree to pay child support in an amount greater than that required by the guidelines, a stipulation by the parties to pay an amount of child support greater

                            Increase in monthly support payments for two teenaged children from $ 300 to $ 430 was not abuse of discretion in view of rise in cost of living, fact that children were living in California instead of North Dakota and 16% increase in father’s income

                            Amendment of divorce decree to increase the amount of child support awarded requires trial court to make findings of fact setting forth the changes in circumstances warranting modification of the decree. Skoglund v. Skoglund, 333 N.W.2d 795, 1983

                            In an action for modification of child support, the trial court’s findings that a material change of circumstances occurred as a result of an increase in the cost of living, the mother’s indebtedness arising from medical expenses for herself and the children,
                            and the father’s increase in income were not clearly erroneous. Freyer v. Freyer, 427 N.W.2d 348, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 189</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                            ex-husband did not sustain his burden of showing a substantial change of circumstances and trial court did not err in dismissing his motion to reduce child support. Schmidt v. Schmidt, 432 N.W.2d 860, 1988

                            In a child support case, in addition to the obligor’s financial position, the court must also consider the needs of the children and dependent spouse in determining whether or not there has been a change in circumstances. State ex rel. Younger v. Bryant,

                            The right to support belongs to the child, and the custodial parent has only a representational right to collect support on behalf of the child. In light of the strong public policy against divorce settlements that contract away a child’s right to support,
                            it is unnecessary to show a material change of circumstances as a prerequisite to modification of an original decree that provides no child support. Sullivan v. Quist, 506 N.W.2d 394, 1993

                            Parental stipulations regarding child support are legitimate incidents of parental authority and control and are entitled to serious consideration by a court; however, notwithstanding a parental agreement, a trial court has continuing jurisdiction to
                            modify child support. Smith v. Smith, 538 N.W.2d 222, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 178</cite> (N.D. 1995).

                            Father’s unemployment and resultant loss of income did not constitute a material change of circumstances justifying a reduction of his child support obligation where trial court was presented with evidence during divorce proceedings that father’s job
                            as a skilled pipefitter frequently involved periods of unemployment and his current unemployment and reduction in income was arguably temporary in nature. Burrell v. Burrell, 359 N.W.2d 381, 1985

                            Trial court’s decision to deny a husband’s request for a reduction in child support payments was not clearly erroneous where the husband failed to present income tax returns or a recent balance sheet to show his current financial position. Redlin v. Redlin,

                            To the extent the stipulation of the parents purports to mechanically restrict the father’s child support obligation to half of the children’s reasonable and necessary expenses, it violates public policy expressed in the child support guidelines by limiting

                            Within the meaning of the child support guidelines and for the purpose of determining whether losses from “self-employment” are pertinent to the calculation of gross income, “self-employment” differentiates between a vocation, pursued at least in part

                            not conclusive as to whether he was “self-employed” for child support purposes and he did not offer affirmative evidence of any long-term benefits his children would receive from his rodeo participation; therefore, trial court

                            In its custody determination, the trial court properly took into account the father’s failure to provide child support when no court order was in effect; this section established the obligation to provide support, and the father did not need an order

                            There was no error in ordering a father to pay child support for an autistic child that resided at a state hospital because the divorce judgment awarded a mother primary residential responsibility; regardless of the actual underlying factual circumstances,

                            For case adopting a presumption that social security payments received on behalf of minor children, as a result of parent’s disability, should be credited toward that parent’s support obligation not exceeding the monthly suppport obligation set forth

                            order, see Guthmiller v. Guthmiller, 448 N.W.2d 643, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 1989). But see Tibor v. Bendrick, 1999 ND 92, 593 N.W.2d 395, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 117</cite>                            (N.D. 1999).

                            The fact that the non-custodial parent earns a substantial income may not per se entitle the children to support payments in excess of their appropriate needs. However, if there are sufficient resources, children of divorce are entitled to enjoy a standard

                            Where wife held three certificates of deposit, each jointly with an individual child, trial court was correct to set aside these certificates as the “children’s college fund” rather than treat funds as marital property upon divorce. Although not all parents

                            Especially in cases involving an interstate custody dispute, assessment of transportation costs against either party for facilitation of visitation is a necessary incident to the issue of visitation rights. Vande Hoven v. Vande Hoven, 399 N.W.2d 855,
                            1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                            Ex-husband’s motion seeking a change of child custody was sufficient to apprise ex-wife of possible modification of his visitation rights and assessment against her of transportation costs to facilitate visitation. Vande Hoven v. Vande Hoven, 399 N.W.2d
                            855, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                        <p>
                            District court had authority under N.D.R.Civ.P. 7(b), to amend ex-husband’s child visitation rights and assess all transportation costs against ex-wife, even where the only relief sought by ex-husband’s motion was a change of custody. Vande Hoven v. Vande
                            Hoven, 399 N.W.2d 855, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                        <p>
                            Because assessment of transportation costs is incidental to the issue of visitation rights, and because visitation rights are a part of the broader issue of child custody, the court’s assessment of transportation costs and modification of visitation rights
                            does not constitute relief “different” than that prayed for within the meaning of N.D.R.Civ.P. 7(b) and 54(c). Nor do amending visitation rights and assessing transportation costs against ex-wife amount to an award of “greater”
                            relief to ex-husband than if he had been awarded custody of the children. Vande Hoven v. Vande Hoven, 399 N.W.2d 855, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                            District court erred in refusing to address the issue of child support because it had original jurisdiction to enter a child support order in conjunction with the divorce proceeding, superseding the temporary order entered in another district court while
                            the divorce was pending and the parties were still married; by its terms, the temporary child support judgment did not divest the divorce court of jurisdiction to award child support as part of the divorce judgment. Wanttaja

                            Trial court did not err in specifying December 1, 2002, as the effective date of the husband’s child support obligation; unless a commencement date was specified in a court’s order, a judgment or order requiring the payment of child support was effective
                            as to the child in the month in which the order was signed. Oldham v. Oldham, 2004 ND 62, 677 N.W.2d 196, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 75</cite> (N.D. 2004).

                            Conditions for the payment of post-majority child support are self-executing, and an obligor is not obligated to pay child support for the benefit of a child whenever such conditions enumerated in a judgment are not satisfied for that child. Steffes v.

                        to that required under the child support guidelines, whether or not the motion or petition for amendment arises out of a periodic review of a child support obligation, and whether or not a material change of circumstances has taken
                        place, unless the presumption that the correct amount of child support would result from the application of the child support guidelines is rebutted. If a motion or petition for amendment is filed within one year of the entry of
                        the obligation sought to be amended, the party seeking amendment must also show a material change of circumstances.

                        government, constitutes a material change of circumstances. The availability of health insurance at reasonable cost to a child who is the subject of a child support order constitutes a material change of circumstances. The need

                            A movant for amendment of a child support order under this section has the burden of proving that the existing level of support is not in conformity with the guidelines. Henry v. Henry, 2000 ND 10, 604 N.W.2d 234, 2000

                            In a case where a mother sought a modification of child support, a trial court did not erroneously shift the burden of proof to a father as the nonmoving party to show that the existing level of support did not conform with the guidelines. It was only
                            after the trial court accepted the mother’s argument that it reviewed and rejected the father’s argument; although the trial court determined that the father failed to rebut the mother’s evidence, the trial court did not begin
                            with the presumption that the mother’s support was incongruous with the guidelines. Devine v. Hennessee, 2014 ND 122, 848 N.W.2d 679, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                            Although the Supreme Court of North Dakota was not convinced that the district court’s findings regarding child support were clearly erroneous, the court did not rule on how to calculate the father’s child support arrearage, i.e., whether to include amounts
                            paid pursuant to a side agreement between the mother and the father and the father was free to raise that issue on remand. Bertsch v. Bertsch, 2006 ND 31, 710 N.W.2d 113, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite>                            (N.D. 2006).

                            A material change of circumstances is required for motions to modify child support filed within one year of entry of the order which the movant seeks to modify; however, a material change of circumstances is not required for motions filed more than one

                            Obligor’s failure to provide 1992 tax return when he should have barred him from later claiming that it evidenced a material change in circumstances; a motion to modify, brought within one year of a prior modification proceeding, must be based on a material
                            change of circumstances, not on an error in the prior modification proceeding. Schmidt v. Reamann, 523 N.W.2d 70, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 228</cite> (N.D. 1994).

                            Tax return, showing that father’s financial circumstances had changed materially since the last modification hearing, was not, standing alone, a material change of circumstances justifying a modification of his child support obligation where the referee
                            considered his testimony regarding the continued downsizing of his farm operation and recommended a fifteen percent downward deviation from the support amount called for by the guidelines; any erosion of father’s farm income
                            which occurred after the hearing was foreseen at the previous modification hearing and could not be considered a material change in circumstances for the purpose of further reducing his child support obligation. Schmidt v.

                            Where motion to modify support was brought nearly two years after the original judgment setting the child support obligation, the trial court correctly determined that no material change of circumstances was necessary to modify the support order. Reinecke

Mahoney v. Mahoney, 538 N.W.2d 189, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 174</cite>                            (N.D. 1995).

                            If the court determines that past income is unlikely to recur, it should award the children some portion of such income while also ordering a future reduction in support when the effect of the windfall ceases. Helbling v. Helbling, 541 N.W.2d 443, 1995

                            Subsection (4) clearly requires an obligor requesting a change in child support to show a material change of circumstances if the motion to amend is brought “within one year of the entry of the order sought to be amended.” Withey v. Hager, 1997 ND 225,

                            Trial court erred in applying a “change of circumstances” standard instead of modifying support according to Child Support Guidelines when father’s request for modification of child support occurred more than one year after the support order had been
                            entered. Lauer v. Lauer, 2000 ND 82, 609 N.W.2d 450, 2000 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 90</cite> (N.D. 2000).

                            In former wife’s action seeking an increase in child support payments by her former husband based upon his receipt of disability payments, trial court misapplied the guidelines by determining that the father’s disability automatically precluded a child
                            support obligation without a hearing, as a disability did not necessarily excuse a parent from the obligation to pay child support under N.D. Admin. Code § 75-02-04.1-07(4)(b) and the burden of proof was on the obligor to show
                            the disability was sufficient in severity to reasonably preclude employment. Oien v. Oien, 2005 ND 205, 706 N.W.2d 81, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 250</cite> (N.D. 2005).

                            To allow an obligor or obligee to parse various facets of a child support obligation through numerous challenges without regard to the one-year period under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-08.4" target="_self">14-09-08.4</a></cite>(4)
                            would defeat the limited finality feature of the law, which is intended to restrain the frequency of changing child support orders; therefore, mother’s motion to modify child support was denied because she failed to show a
                            material change in circumstances under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-08.4" target="_self">14-09-08.4</a></cite>(4). Even though the motion was the first seeking to modify the actual amount of child
                            support paid, earlier that same year the mother had challenged a bonus payment and an income tax exemption. Dunnuck v. Dunnuck, 2006 ND 247, 724 N.W.2d 124, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 239</cite> (N.D. 2006).

                            Father, who sought a reduction in his child support obligation, was required to prove a material change in circumstances; the father failed to meet his burden because the father provided the trial court with no documented evidence to show the current
                            income and expenses of the corporation and his net income for purposes of the guidelines. Gunia v. Gunia, 2009 ND 32, 763 N.W.2d 455, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 2009).

                            Trial court erred in granting the father’s motion to modify his child support obligation because the reasons given for the termination of the father’s employment, attendance issues with scheduled meetings, incompletion on work and negative impacts on
                            employee morale, were within his control and thus, support a finding that he was responsible for the termination of his employment. Once the court found that the father’s actions led to the termination of his employment, it
                            essentially determined the reduction in income was self-induced and thus, there was no material change in circumstances warranting modification of his child support obligation. Koffler v. Koffler, 2020 ND 184, 947 N.W.2d 896,

                            Trial court did not err in computing child support obligation on “in-kind income” because child support guidelines no longer permit calculation of a child support obligation on this basis, where the trial court’s decision was rendered before the effective
                            date of the new guidelines; if noncustodial parent believed the guidelines were more favorable to her, she would be entitled after remand to move for modification of her support obligation. McDonough v. Murphy, 539 N.W.2d 313,

                            while the issue of child support remained undecided, the district court erred in failing to close the record and address the mother’s child support modification motion when it issued its order nine months after the mother’s

                            Trial court’s modification of a husband’s child support obligation pursuant to a wife’s motion was overturned because the trial court simply adopted the husband’s calculations contained in one of the child support guidelines worksheets that he provided
                            and the husband’s calculations totally excluded his capital gain income from the sale of farmland and from the sale of farm equipment. Berge v. Berge, 2006 ND 46, 710 N.W.2d 417, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 46</cite>                            (N.D. 2006).

                            A voluntary change of employment resulting in a reduction of income does not, by itself, foreclose an obligor from seeking modification of a child support obligation, where obligor did not have to prove a material change in circumstances because his support
                            order was over one year old; since obligor is entitled to periodic review of his child support obligation, it necessarily follows that he is not absolutely precluded from seeking the modification when, due to a voluntary change
                            of employment, application of the guidelines to his present income will reduce his support obligation. Nelson v. Nelson, 547 N.W.2d 741, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            Based on the strong public policy for adequate support and maintenance of minor children, a stipulation by the parties prohibiting or limiting the power of the court to modify future child support is against public policy and invalid. Zarrett v. Zarrett,

                    A stepparent is not bound to maintain the spouse’s dependent children, as defined in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.stat.title.50.html#t50c50-09s50-09-01" target="_blank">50-09-01</a></cite>, unless the child is received
                    into the stepparent’s family. If the stepparent receives them into the family, the stepparent is liable, to the extent of the stepparent’s ability, to support them during the marriage and so long thereafter as they remain in the stepparent’s
                    family. Such liability may be enforced against the stepparent by any person furnishing necessaries to such children. If an order issued under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-08.10" target="_self">14-09-08.10</a></cite>                    requires an obligee to provide health insurance coverage, any coverage that is available to the stepparent for the obligee’s dependent children is considered to be available to the obligee and is enforceable against the stepparent
                    by a child support agency. If the children are received into the stepparent’s family and supported by the stepparent, it is presumed that the stepparent does so as a parent, in which case the children are not liable to the stepparent
                    for their support, nor the stepparent to them for their services. The legal obligation of a natural or adoptive parent to support that person’s children is not affected by the liability imposed upon their stepparent by this section.

                            Where a stepparent voluntarily receives a stepchild into the family and treats it as a member thereof, the stepparent stands in the place of a natural parent, and reciprocal rights, duties, and obligations of parent and child continue as long as the relationship
                            continues. Druey v. Druey, 63 N.D. 786, 249 N.W. 782, 1933 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 239</cite> (N.D. 1933).

                            The obligation imposed upon a natural father for support remains intact whether or not a stepfather provided support, even though a stepparent may, in some circumstances be liable to support his or her spouse’s dependent children. Mougey v. Salzwedel,

                            A stepparent naturally takes on a family relationship with children of a spouse; therefore, there is a relationship between a stepparent’s financial situation and the circumstances of a spouse’s dependent children. Hedstrom v. Berg, 421 N.W.2d 488, 1988

                <p>
                    An obligor may execute a document voluntarily authorizing income withholding from current or future income due the obligor from an income payer in an amount sufficient to meet any child support obligation imposed by a court or otherwise. An income withholding
                    authorization made under this section is binding on the income payer one week after service upon the income payer by first-class mail, or in any other manner agreed to by the income payer, of a true copy of the executed income withholding
                    authorization. The income payer shall deduct the sum or sums specified and pay them as specified by the income withholding authorization and any applicable imposition of a support obligation by a court. In addition, the income payer
                    may deduct a fee of three dollars per month from the obligor’s income to cover expenses involved in transmitting payment. Compliance by an income payer with an income withholding authorization issued under this section discharges the
                    income payer’s liability to the obligor for that portion of the obligor’s income. The income payer may not use the income withholding authorization as a basis for any disciplinary action against the obligor.

                        The department of human services shall establish child support guidelines to assist courts in determining the amount a parent should be expected to contribute toward the support of the child under this section. The guidelines must:

                            Trial court’s finding of undue hardship was clearly erroneous where child support obligor’s financial burdens stemming from her voluntary remarriage and her having children of that marriage did not constitute “factors not considered by the guidelines”

                            The trial court erred in deducting the entire monthly principal payment of a spouse’s debt as a business cost in determining the child support obligation, because the guidelines take into consideration “[t]he subsistence needs, work expenses, and daily
                            living expenses of the obligor”, and to the extent that any of that payment was applied to construction of the spouse’s house, rather than to farm land acquisition, that portion did not qualify as a deductible business cost.

                            properly imputed income to determine the father’s child support arrears and future support payments. The trial court also properly declined to deduct the father’s self-employment losses, because those losses did not accurately
                            reflect the father’s earning capability; further, it was appropriate for the trial court to consider that the father’s self-employment would become profitable in the near future, based in part on the father’s own testimony
                            that the outlook for the businesses was improving. T.E.J. v. T.S., 2004 ND 120, 681 N.W.2d 444, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 2004).

                            In calculating imputed income for modification of a child support order, the trial court erred in extrapolating a shorter period to a 12-month figure because N.D. Admin. Code § 75-02-04.1-07(9) requires imputed income to be based upon an obligor’s actual
                            income in a prior 12-month period. Christoffersen v. Giese, 2005 ND 17, 691 N.W.2d 195, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 2005).

                            In the absence of evidence regarding the obligor’s resources, the court may presume that the party in question earns the minimum wage for a 40-hour work week. Incarceration alone cannot rebut this presumption of a minimum wage, as some inmates enter prison
                            with assets from past employment and/or earn income while in prison. In the absence of proof from an incarcerated person that he or she does not have such resources, it would not be in the best interest of his children to excuse
                            that person from support obligations. Berger v. Hernandez (In the Interest of R.H.), 2004 ND 170, 686 N.W.2d 107, 2004 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 295</cite> (N.D. 2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S.

                            little or no control, the guidelines account for these fluctuations by permitting a farmer-obligor to average his or her farm income from the five most recent years. Schmidt v. Reamann, 523 N.W.2d 70, 1994

                            After the promulgation of child support guidelines pursuant to this section, determinations of child support are made by applying the calculations required by the regulations, and these calculations result in an amount of child support which is presumptively

                            In a child support modification action, the trial court’s finding that the father would not continue his out-of-state custom harvesting operations was not clearly erroneous, and in consideration of that fact, the trial court properly refused to include
                            losses from those operations for computing the father’s income, because those past losses would not have been “the best predictor” of the father’s future income. Further, the father could not predicate error on the ground the
                            trial court failed to exclude gains in 1997 and 1998 from the out-of-state custom harvesting operations, because the father failed to provide the district court necessary information to determine those gains, if any. Shane

                            When the father failed to present credible, complete information from which his future income could be reliably projected, the referee properly based the father’s child support on a projection of the father’s income for the last nine months of the year
                            and the father’s actual income for January through March. Montgomery v. Montgomery, 2003 ND 135, 667 N.W.2d 611, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 140</cite> (N.D. 2003).

                            Even though obligor mother may have had difficulty maintaining her current standard of living and paying child support, this was not different from an ordinary family that must forego a comfortable lifestyle to raise children; mother’s budget, part of
                            the record, contained items which could be reduced to pay for the house. Based on the guardian ad litem’s testimony, she should make cuts in these other areas to maintain the marital home for child. Scherling v. Scherling,

                            Within the meaning of the child support guidelines and for the purpose of determining whether losses from “self-employment” are pertinent to the calculation of gross income, “self-employment” differentiates between a vocation, pursued at least in part
                            to sustain the obligor and the obligor’s family, and an avocation, performed primarily for enjoyment without the reasonable expectation that the activity will be used to further the obligor’s child support obligation. Wilhelm

                            not conclusive as to whether he was “self-employed” for child support purposes and he did not offer affirmative evidence of any long-term benefits his children would receive from his rodeo participation; therefore, trial court
                            did not err when it determined that his rodeo participation was an avocation not warranting consideration of the losses he sustained when it computed his child support obligation. Wilhelm v. Wilhelm, 543 N.W.2d 488, 1996

                            Trial court erred by reducing a former husband’s child support obligation by the amount of self-employment farming losses incurred to reduce his income from a non-farming job with the county because the losses exceeded 40 percent in the averaged years
                            and section 75-02-04.1-05(7), N.D. Admin. Code, authorized the use of a self-employment loss resulting from averaging to reduce income that was not related to self-employment only if the loss was calculated for no more than

                            Where it was unclear how the trial court arrived at the monthly child support obligation, a mere recitation that the guidelines had been considered in arriving at the amount of a child support obligation was insufficient to show compliance with the guidelines,

                            Failure to order increase in support be made effective with first payment after motion to increase was filed constituted an abuse of discretion, where obligor spouse’s conduct delayed for a year obligee’s and child’s right to collect the appropriate amount

                        <p>
                            It was an abuse of discretion to delay, without explanation, the effective date of the child support modification until July 2001, which was more than two years after the father moved to modify his support obligation, as the father was required to pay
                            substantially more than the presumptively correct amount under the guidelines for those two years and was required to continue paying an amount which had been based upon five minor children, when at the time the amended judgment
                            was finally entered there were only two minor children for whom the father owed support; thus, the court reversed the order and remanded with directions that the trial court’s order modifying the amount of child support be

                            Department of Human Services may consider as “income,” “imputed income,” in determining a child support obligation under the guidelines, but should consider an obligor parent’s incarceration and the limited employment opportunities available to the obligor
                            because he is in prison in calculating the amount of income to impute to him. Surerus v. Matuska, 548 N.W.2d 384, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 145</cite> (N.D. 1996).

                            As a matter of law, an incarcerated child support obligor whose payment amounts are based on an imputed, federal-minimum-wage income cannot reduce these payments by showing a lack of financial resources due to imprisonment, and the fact that a prisoner
                            cannot rebut the presumption of correctness based on an inability to pay because of imprisonment does not mean that 42 U.S.C.S. § 667(b)(2) has been violated; therefore, an incarcerated father’s motion to reduce child support
                            payments was denied. State v. Stoppleworth (In re A.M.S.), 2005 ND 64, 694 N.W.2d 8, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 68</cite> (N.D. 2005).

                            the child support guidelines is the correct amount of child support. Hence, an order requiring an incarcerated father to reimburse a department of human services for support provided to child before the father’s parental rights
                            were terminated was upheld; father’s premise that the North Dakota child support guidelines created an irrebuttable minimum payment based upon imputation of a minimum wage income to a prisoner, was wrong. Father failed to provide

                            A finding by the trial court of the obligor’s net income is now essential because of the advent of the rebuttable presumption that the child support guidelines establish the correct amount of support; where the trial court’s findings of fact shed no light
                            on how it computed an obligor’s child support obligation and did not indicate that the trial court applied the guidelines, the case was remanded for a specific finding of the obligor’s net income, computation of child support
                            under the child support guidelines and health insurance premium payments. Foreng v. Foreng, 509 N.W.2d 38, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 222</cite> (N.D. 1993).

                            Where the trial court belatedly stated that it considered visitation in determining child support, it did not make written or specific findings sufficient to enable the court to review the court’s deviation from child support guidelines of approximately

                            N.D.C.C. ch. 28-32, or that they were otherwise binding upon the trial court, the trial court did not err in ordering child support which deviated from the guidelines. Huber v. Jahner, 460 N.W.2d 717, 1990 N.D. App. LEXIS 6

                            The presumption that the correct amount of child support is obtained by applying the child support guidelines may be rebutted by evidence establishing that factors not considered by the guidelines would result in undue hardship to the obligor or supported

                            Assuming that plaintiff had correctly computed defendant’s support obligation using the guideline formula, the monthly support payment would presumptively be a correct support award. That presumptive support obligation is rebuttable under this section
                            only with a specific written finding by the court that the preponderance of the evidence establishes that factors not considered by the guidelines would result in an undue hardship for defendant to pay that amount. Zacher v.

                            Trial court erroneously increased father’s support obligation set by guidelines to include additional monthly amount based on considerable debt from the marriage and mother’s limited income; court failed to make a specific finding that the presumptive
                            support amount had been rebutted. Olson v. Olson, 1998 ND 190, 585 N.W.2d 134, 1998 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 198</cite> (N.D. 1998).

                            Even though the court did not use the magic words “the guidelines are hereby rebutted,” the effect of its finding was the same: the increased child care expense resulting from child’s preschool age and wife’s full-time employment required an increase
                            in husband’s support obligation from the presumptive amount. Perala v. Carlson, 520 N.W.2d 839, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 1994).

                            Where mother worked full time and netted $ 975 per month and incurred daycare expenses of $ 480 per month, the trial court properly determined that the presumptive amount of child support under the guidelines was rebutted by the full cost of child care.

                            The amount per month husband was ordered to pay for one child’s support was not income to wife, and was not required to be considered in calculating wife’s child support obligation for the couple’s child in her custodial care; although a custodial parent
                            may have a representational right to collect support on behalf of a child, the right to the support actually belongs to the child. Spilovoy v. Spilovoy, 488 N.W.2d 873, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite>                            (N.D. 1992).

                            The court cannot rely on the guidelines in determining the support obligation, except as a preliminary “starting point.” Bergman v. Bergman, 486 N.W.2d 243, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1992).

                            When the guidelines do not establish the amount of child support, the trial court must decide the amount by striking a balance between the needs of the children and the ability of the noncustodial parent to pay, but the guidelines should still inform
                            the court’s inquiry. Bergman v. Bergman, 486 N.W.2d 243, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 1992).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The child support guidelines contemplate a parent’s financial ability to pay and permit an individualized examination of the presumptive amount established by the guidelines, so that the implementation of the guidelines satisfies section 27-20-49(3).

                        Scale of suggested minimum contributions established pursuant to this section is merely a set of guidelines, and a trial court is required to consider guidelines but is not required to award child support within suggested scale. Burrell v. Burrell, 359
                        N.W.2d 381, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                    <p>
                        Four hundred dollars per month child support was not excessive although it was higher than the child support guidelines published by the Department of Human Services. In its discretion, a trial court may award child support exceeding published guidelines.

                            Court erred in its income calculation for the father because the father and his roommate had an equal obligation to pay their landlord the full amount of the rent under the terms of the lease, the rental obligation was money owed to the landlord, it was
                            not money owed to the father; thus, the roommate’s share of the rent was not a payment owed to an obligor as required by the definition of income. Eubanks v. Fisketjon, 2021 ND 124, 2021 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 122</cite>                            (N.D. 2021).

                            In a withholding hearing the court may deny the issuance of an income withholding order only if there has been a mistake of fact as to the identity of the obligor or an overstatement in the calculation of the amount of support stated to be owed. Bloom

                <p>
                    Upon amendment or termination of an income withholding order, the child support agency shall send appropriate notice to the income payer. An income withholding order is to be amended by the child support agency when the total amount of money to be withheld
                    is changed by elimination of arrearages or by court-ordered change in amount of child support. An income withholding order is to be terminated when the duty to support ceases and all child support arrearages have been paid. When two
                    or more income payers have been subjected to income withholding orders with respect to a child support obligation, the child support agency shall suspend the income withholding order directed to one or more income payers, provided
                    that the amount of child support withheld by the remaining income payer or payers equals the amount determined under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-09.30" target="_self">14-09-09.30</a></cite>.
                    The child support agency shall immediately reinstate any suspended income withholding order should any child support obligation of the obligor thereafter become delinquent. The child support agency shall provide a copy of the reinstated
                    income withholding order, by first-class mail, to the obligor and the income payer.

                            The statute plainly requires timely child support payments, and courts should not refuse to order immediate income withholding as a reward for complying with the law by making timely payments. Shipley v. Shipley, 509 N.W.2d 49, 1993

                            Where the trial court failed to order immediate income withholding and did not find good cause, in view of the obligor’s testimony that he had not necessarily made all of his child support payments in a timely fashion, it was concluded, as a matter of
                            law, that “good cause” did not exist. Shipley v. Shipley, 509 N.W.2d 49, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 1993).

                            When good cause not to order income withholding is fairly raised and presented, an order imposing income withholding should express that good cause was not demonstrated.

                            enforced; therefore, where the parties acknowledged that their agreement did not establish child support in accordance with the guidelines and they did not present evidence that the stipulation met the criteria for rebutting
                            the presumptive support amount under the guidelines, the matter was remanded for determination of the correct child support amount based on the guidelines. Lee v.

                            Parents’ agreement regarding child support was unenforceable because it was inconsistent with the child support guidelines regarding the computation of support. In addition, a provision that limited the ability to seek future support for the child was
                            void and unenforceable; the provision was against public policy because it could result in an support amount that was less than required by the guidelines and because it limited the district court’s authority to modify child
                            support. State v. Wolff, 2011 ND 164, 801 N.W.2d 694, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 161</cite> (N.D. 2011).

                            The liability imposed upon the children by this section can be likened to the liability of a guarantor. A guarantor, not being a joint contractor with his principal, is not bound to do what the principal has contracted to do, but only to answer for the

                            District court erred in declining to rule on an issue about all of the children’s liability for their parents’ nursing home debt; application of the statute to all children could have some effect upon nursing home debt and son could not be held personally

                <p>
                    The abuse of parental authority is the subject of judicial cognizance in a civil action in the district court brought by the child, or by relatives of the child within the third degree, or by the human service zone of the county where the child resides,
                    and when the abuse is established the child may be freed from the dominion of the parent and the duty of support and education may be enforced.

                            Father failed to clearly demonstrate that the child abuse statutes were unconstitutionally vague and contravened the federal or state constitution; the statute need not set out in explicit detail all possible factual scenarios that would fall within its
                            reach; it need only give adequate and fair warning, when measured by the common understanding and practice of a “reasonable person,” of the proscribed conduct. Simons v. State, 2011 ND 190, 803 N.W.2d 587, 2011

                            Substantial evidence supported defendant’s conviction for abuse or neglect of a child where there was evidence that defendant was involved heavily with drugs and was alone with the 15-month-old victim for a period of time shortly before the child’s death,
                            which was caused by a violent, forceful shaking associated with a blunt force impact to the head. There was also some evidence that defendant admitted shaking the baby. State v. McClary, 2004 ND 98, 679 N.W.2d 455, 2004

                            Evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s convictions of gross sexual imposition and abuse or neglect of a child because the son testified that he and defendant had sex after defendant got out of the shower, the daughter testified that defendant
                            was present when her father had sex with her, and a third child testified that defendant had sex with the son. The jury also heard testimony from a detective, a physician who examined the daughter, and an employee of county

                            The trial court did not err in denying a father compensatory visitation with his child; this section did not authorize the award of compensatory visitation when the father had been denied four years of visitation with the child. Eberhardt v. Eberhardt,

                            Where custodial mother’s conduct in alienating children from their father and her interference with the father’s visitation was held “outrageous” by the trial court, attorney fee award to father in change of custody proceeding was not an abuse of discretion.
                            Hendrickson v. Hendrickson, 1999 ND 37, 590 N.W.2d 220, 1999 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1999).

                            The appellate court interprets the word “shall” according to its ordinary meaning, creating a mandatory duty, and under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-06.5" target="_self">14-09-06.5</a></cite>, a trial
                            court must award reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs if it finds that an allegation of harm to the child is false, and was not made in good faith; and under this section, a trial court also must award reasonable attorney’s
                            fees and costs if it finds there has been willful and persistent denial of visitation rights by the custodial parent. Sweeney v. Sweeney, 2002 ND 206, 654 N.W.2d 407, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 268</cite> (N.D. 2002).

                            A father’s actions constituted willful and persistent denial of the mother’s visitation rights and, accordingly, the mother was entitled to attorney’s fees under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-09s14-09-24" target="_self">14-09-24</a></cite>                            where, by the father’s own admission, his conduct was deliberate and intentional, as he did not feel he needed to do anything to facilitate visitation with the mother, the father frustrated a resolution of the matter by agreeing
                            to August 2004 visitation and, thus, postponing the mother’s pursuit of her motion for structured visitation, and then did not follow through on the agreement. Sisk v.

                            the mother’s interference with his visitation rights, because the father failed to prove the actual amount of attorney fees he incurred in fighting the denial of his visitation rights. Lynch v. Sweeney, 2007 ND 81, 732 N.W.2d

                            Statute is not mandatory or absolute; however, when a parent perpetrates domestic violence as described in the statute, fees must be awarded unless those costs would place an undue financial hardship. Wisnewski v. Wisnewski, 2020 ND 148, 945 N.W.2d 331,

                            This section does not provide a basis to deny attorney fees because a victim of domestic violence returns to the domestic violence perpetrator. Therefore, a trial court erred when it impermissibly considered that a mother had returned to a father after
                            she experienced domestic violence at his hands. Kulbacki v. Michael, 2014 ND 83, 845 N.W.2d 625, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 2014).

                        <p>
                            District court erred by considering a mother's non-violent conduct as provoking or explaining domestic violence committed against her; a parent does not invite violence by asking the other parent to abide by a court-ordered parenting time plan. O'Hara

                        <p>
                            District court erred because it balanced the domestic violence factor against other best interests factors without first determining whether the presumption had been raised and, if raised, rebutted with clear and convincing evidence, and it treated a
                            child's maintaining a relationship with both parents as not just a factor but a predominant best interests factor. O'Hara v. Schneider, 2017 ND 53, 890 N.W.2d 831, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite>                            (N.D. 2017).

                        <p>
                            District court may consider a child's maintenance of a relationship with both parents or any other factor under which it may be relevant; the precedents, however, do not elevate this as an additional factor that district courts may consider in substitution
                            for the statutory factors. O'Hara v. Schneider, 2017 ND 53, 890 N.W.2d 831, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 2017).

                            Because the parties stipulated to the primary residential responsibility and parenting time provisions in the divorce judgment, any claimed error in applying the domestic violence presumption in the interim order was waived; to the extent the wife argued
                            the district court erred in applying the domestic violence presumption in the interim order, she waived her argument when she stipulated to the residential responsibility and parenting time arrangement contained in the judgment.

                            District court clearly erred in relying on the absence of domestic violence directed at the children to rebut the presumption; even though the children might not have physical injuries or been the intended targets of the father’s domestic violence, children
                            are still victimized by the climate a domestic violence situation creates and any domestic violence is presumed to negatively impact children. The children witnessed the domestic violence, including when the father’s son intervened
                            and used a knife to protect his mother. Wisnewski v. Wisnewski, 2020 ND 148, 945 N.W.2d 331, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 148</cite> (N.D. 2020).

                            While laudable, it is insufficient for a perpetrator of domestic violence to complete drug or alcohol treatment to rebut the presumption, because it is not treatment for domestic violence and does not address violent behaviors and tendencies; in this
                            case, the district court clearly erred by relying on the father’s alcohol and drug use and subsequent substance use disorder treatment to find the presumption of domestic violence was rebutted. Wisnewski v. Wisnewski, 2020

                            Lapse of time alone does not overcome the presumption because domestic violence is a learned behavior; the father had not completed any treatment for domestic violence, and in the 15 months the parties had not lived together, he violated a no contact
                            order and was found in contempt in the domestic violence protection order proceeding, and thus in this case, the passage of time alone did not rebut the presumption. Wisnewski v. Wisnewski, 2020 ND 148, 945 N.W.2d 331, 2020

                            To rebut the presumption there must be a showing by clear and convincing evidence that unsupervised parenting time would not endanger the child’s physical or emotional health; the evidence the district court relied on in this case left the court with
                            a definite conviction that a mistake had been made and failed to provide clear evidence that unsupervised parenting time would not endanger the children. Wisnewski v. Wisnewski, 2020 ND 148, 945 N.W.2d 331, 2020

                            Trial court’s only finding on domestic violence was the acknowledgment of the father’s conviction for aggravated assault domestic violence, and this conviction alone was sufficient reason to find the statutory presumption of supervised parenting was triggered
                            based on serious bodily injury; while the court would have preferred more detailed findings, it was clear that the father’s conduct triggered the presumption and this finding was not clearly erroneous. Wisnewski v. Wisnewski,

                            District court complied with the appellate mandate by holding an evidentiary hearing and properly found, on remand, that a father had rebutted the statutory presumption of supervised parenting time because a material change in circumstances had occurred
                            where he actively took care of the parties' child during his parenting times, they had a strong father-daughter bond, there was no evidence showing harm to the child resulting from the father's recent visits, he successfully
                            completed his anger management treatment, and the counselor's testimony regarding the father's progress was relevant to whether he was likely to endanger the child if left unsupervised. 2017 ND 159, 2017

                            District court erred in entering a third amended judgment modifying the father's parenting time while he was incarcerated as the district court failed to make sufficient findings of fact in the third amended judgment because the district court made no
                            findings as to whether a material change in circumstances occurred, whether suspended visitation was necessary as visitation was likely to endanger the children, and whether modification of the second amended judgment was necessary
                            to serve the best interests of the children; and the district court failed to make findings stating why supervised parenting time by a professional was necessary to protect the children's physical or emotional health. Curtiss

                            Trial court’s use of a parenting coordinator to develop and implement a parenting plan did not constitute an improper delegation of judicial power; rather, it was a directive to the parties that they had a period of time to develop the parenting plan

                    In any action for divorce, legal separation, paternity, or guardianship in which children are involved, the court, upon its own motion or by motion or agreement of the parties, may appoint a parenting coordinator to assist the parties in resolving disputes
                    related to the parenting plan or court order. A party, at any time before the appointment of a parenting coordinator, may file a written objection to the appointment on the basis of domestic violence having been committed by another
                    party against the objecting party or a child who is a subject of the action. After the objection is filed, a parenting coordinator may not be appointed unless, on the request of a party, a hearing is held and the court finds that a
                    preponderance of the evidence does not support the objection. If a parenting coordinator is appointed, the court shall order appropriate measures be taken to ensure the physical and emotional safety of all parties and children.

                        Evidence supported the district court’s appointment of a parenting coordinator because the court found that the parties were in dire need of a parenting coordinator due to the high conflict between the parties and that co-parenting counseling was in the
                        children’s best interests because of the parties’ continuing conflict. Prchal v. Prchal, 2011 ND 62, 795 N.W.2d 693, 2011 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 54</cite> (N.D. 2011).

                        Trial court’s use of a parenting coordinator to develop and implement a parenting plan did not constitute an improper delegation of judicial power; rather, it was a directive to the parties that they had a period of time to develop the parenting plan
                        envisioned by the statute, working with the parenting coordinator. Dieterle v. Dieterle, 2013 ND 71, 830 N.W.2d 571, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 2013).

                    Before the appointment of the parenting coordinator, the court shall give the parties notice that the fees of the parenting coordinator will be apportioned between the parties. In its order appointing the parenting coordinator, the court shall apportion
                    the fees of the parenting coordinator between the parties, with each party bearing the portion of the fees that the court determines is just and equitable under the circumstances. If a party files a pro se motion regarding a parenting
                    time dispute and there is not a court order that provides for apportionment of the fees of a parenting coordinator, the court may require the party requesting the appointment of a parenting coordinator to pay the fees of the coordinator
                    in advance. Neither party may be required to submit a dispute to a parenting coordinator if the party cannot afford to pay the fees of a parenting coordinator or an affordable coordinator is not available, unless the other party agrees
                    to pay the fees. After the fees are incurred, a party may by motion request that the fees be reapportioned on equitable grounds. The court may consider the resources of the parties, the nature of the dispute, and whether a party acted
                    in bad faith. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 14-09.2-06, the court may consider information from the parenting coordinator in determining bad faith.

                    the period of minority.

                    No person, other than the parents, may assume the permanent care and custody of a child, unless authorized so to do by an order or decree of a court having jurisdiction, except that a parent, upon giving written notice to the department of human services
                    and human service zone, may place that person’s own child in the home of the child’s grandparent, uncle, or aunt for adoption or guardianship by the person receiving the child. The child must be considered abandoned if proceedings
                    for the adoption or guardianship of the child are not initiated by such relative within one year following the date of notice of placement. No parent may assign or otherwise transfer the parent’s rights or duties with respect to the
                    care and custody of the parent’s child. Any such transfer or assignment, written or otherwise, is void. This section does not affect the right of the parent to consent in writing to the legal adoption of the parent’s child, but such
                    written consent does not operate to transfer any right in the child in the absence of a decree by a court having jurisdiction. Any person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

                        The county court misinterpreted the statutes when it held that it was not a delinquent act for a minor to enter a liquor establishment, or purchase, attempt to purchase, consume, or possess alcoholic beverages; the fact that the legislature has chosen
                        to define as unruly a child who has committed these delinquent acts is not determinative of whether the acts themselves are classified as delinquent and contributing to such behavior can constitute contributing to delinquency.

                        District court properly increased a father’s child support because the court retained jurisdiction to modify his child support obligation under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act because, at the time the mother filed her child support motion, the
                        father resided either outside of the United States or in North Dakota—both of which would allow the court to modify its previously entered child support order, respectively, and the court did not err in imputing to him an amount

                            Obligor parent’s refusal for over two years to comply with the trial court’s repeated orders to comply with custodial parent’s discovery requests justified trial court’s dismissal of proceedings in which obligor parent sought modification of child obligation.

                            District court did not err in finding that it had jurisdiction to order the child support modification under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) because the parents and the child no longer lived in Nevada; the father was subject to the personal
                            jurisdiction of North Dakota as he lived there; the payment of travel expenses constituted part of a child support order under a plain reading of the UIFSA; and the Nevada court intended to make the travel expenses part of

                            District court properly increased a father’s child support because the court retained jurisdiction to modify his child support obligation under the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act because, at the time the mother filed her child support motion, the
                            father resided either outside of the United States or in North Dakota—both of which would allow the court to modify its previously entered child support order, respectively, and the court did not err in imputing to him an amount
                            for in-kind income of his military housing in South Korea under the Administrative Code. Ferguson v. Wallace-Ferguson, 2018 ND 122, 911 N.W.2d 324, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite>                            (N.D. 2018).

                        While parent’s obligations to support others may be considered by a court in determining the amount to be paid by that parent for support of a child, such obligations cannot be used as a legal excuse by that parent to escape from his coexistent obligation
                        to support his child. State ex rel. Licha v. Doty, 326 N.W.2d 74, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 378</cite> (N.D. 1982).

                        Finding that obligor’s monthly income was more than accounted for in providing for his current wife and resident children did not require the conclusion that obligor did not have the present ability to provide support for his nonresident child born before
                        his current marriage, especially since the obligor was making payments on several nonessential items such as a television, washer and dryer, wedding rings, and cars, and where he was aware of the nonresident child before taking

                        As used in former N.D.C.C. § 14-12.1-24, “present needs and circumstances of the obligee” refers to the parent and child to whom a duty of support is owed, whether or not the petitioner in the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act proceeding
                        is the actual person to whom a duty of support is owed, or a state or political subdivision which has expended benefits for the child’s welfare and has been assigned that person’s right to support. State ex rel. Licha v. Doty,

                        An initiating court’s certification of a Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act petition, which sets forth the needs of the child and the amount of that need, is to be considered prima facie evidence in the courts of North Dakota of the present needs and
                        circumstances of the obligee; however, the initiating court’s certification of need is not necessarily conclusive on the courts of this state and the obligor may introduce evidence to rebut an initiating court’s certification of
                        need. State ex rel. Licha v. Doty, 326 N.W.2d 74, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 378</cite> (N.D. 1982).

                            money judgment could be enforced at any time within 20 years from the entry of the judgment. Smith v. Baumgartner, 2003 ND 120, 665 N.W.2d 12, 2003 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D.

                            District court erred in determining that North Dakota was an inconvenient forum to resolve a visitation issue under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-14.1s14-14.1-18" target="_self">14-14.1-18</a></cite>,
                            because the court misapplied the definition of a “child custody determination,” N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-14.1s14-14.1-01" target="_self">14-14.1-01</a></cite>(2), and failed to analyze the factors for

                            alternatives for taking evidence and making a child custody determination in the child’s home state of North Dakota; the father had filed a divorce action in Illinois and was seeking visitation. Castro v. Castro, 2012 ND 137,

                            Where a child custody decree awarding the custody of a child to the mother was originally entered in Montana, the mother resided with the child in Montana, and the mother did not return with the child to North Dakota until after the father filed his petition
                            for a change of custody, a district court lacked jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 14-14.1. A court could not find that the mother or the child did not reside in Montana,
                            and Montana courts had not declined jurisdiction; moreover, the Montana Child Protective Services had become involved with the mother and the mother’s family because of numerous referrals. Harshberger v. Harshberger, 2006 ND

                            Giving priority to a child’s home state is the central provision of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdictional Act (UCCJEA), N.D.C.C. ch. 14-14.1, and the UCCJEA is intended to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts of other states in
                            matters of child custody; it has long been held that subject matter jurisdiction is determined at the time a suit is initiated, and to hold otherwise would undermine one of the UCCJEA’s central functions by allowing participants
                            to divest a state of jurisdiction by changing the analysis after proceedings have begun. Therefore, to qualify as a person acting as a parent under the UCCJEA, a nonparent’s claimed right to legal custody must occur prior to,
                            or simultaneous with, the initial filing related to the instant litigation; to hold otherwise would be contrary to the function of the UCCJEA and contrary to the principles of certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result.

                        A temporary custody order pending trial is a “custody decree” within meaning of this section. State v. Patten, 353 N.W.2d 30, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 331</cite> (N.D. 1984).

                            The issue of visitation rights of the noncustodial parent is a part of the broader issue of child custody. Vande Hoven v. Vande Hoven, 399 N.W.2d 855, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Because assessment of transportation costs is incidental to the issue of visitation rights, and because visitation rights are a part of the broader issue of child custody, the court’s assessment of transportation costs and modification of visitation rights
                            does not constitute relief “different” than that prayed for within the meaning of N.D.R.Civ.P. 7(b) and 54(c). Nor do amending visitation rights and assessing transportation costs against ex-wife amount to an award of “greater”
                            relief to ex-husband than if he had been awarded custody of the children. Vande Hoven v. Vande Hoven, 399 N.W.2d 855, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite> (N.D. 1987).

                            A trial court’s decision to modify custody and visitation rights is subject on appeal to the “clearly erroneous” standard of N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a). Vande Hoven v. Vande Hoven, 399 N.W.2d 855, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 247</cite>                            (N.D. 1987).

                            “Home state” of the child refers not to the state of the child’s legal residence, but to the state of the child’s actual physical presence. Bergstrom v. Bergstrom, 271 N.W.2d 546, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite>                            (N.D. 1978).

                            The district court did not err in refusing to exercise jurisdiction over father’s petition to modify visitation provisions of divorce decree under subdivision 1 a of this section where Iowa, and not North Dakota, was currently the children’s home state,
                            in which they had resided with their custodial parent for more than three years. Dennis v. Dennis, 366 N.W.2d 474, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                            Where child lived with father for at least six consecutive months in New York before the commencement of mother’s proceeding in this state, the district court properly determined that New York, and not North Dakota, was the home state of the child under
                            the provisions of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. Anderson v. Anderson, 449 N.W.2d 799, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                            Under subdivision (5) of this section, the definition of a home state specifically allows periods of temporary absence to count as part of the six-month period. Anderson v. Anderson, 449 N.W.2d 799, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite>                            (N.D. 1989).

                            Where a child was placed with her grandparents in North Dakota by the custodial parent’s own action and initiative, and was fed, clothed, and cared for, the grandparents had a right to custody superior to all except the custodial parent because their
                            actions embodied the common-sense definition of a person acting as a parent; the child thus lived with “persons acting as parents” and North Dakota was the child’s home state. Hangsleben v. Oliver, 502 N.W.2d 838, 1993

                        Where a mother resided with her child, who was the subject of a child custody in dispute, in Montana, and the mother did not return with the child to North Dakota until after the father filed his petition for a change of custody, a district court lacked
                        jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 14-14.1 because a court could not find that the mother or the child did not reside in Montana, and Montana courts had not declined jurisdiction.
                        Moreover, the Montana Child Protective Services had become involved with the mother and the mother’s family because of numerous referrals. Harshberger v. Harshberger, 2006 ND 245, 724 N.W.2d 148, 2006

                        Where a mother resided with her child, who was the subject of a child custody in dispute, in Montana, and the mother did not return with the child to North Dakota until after the father filed his petition for a change of custody, a district court lacked
                        jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, N.D.C.C. ch. 14-14.1 because a court could not find that the mother or the child did not reside in Montana, and Montana courts had not declined jurisdiction.
                        Moreover, the Montana Child Protective Services had become involved with the mother and the mother’s family because of numerous referrals. Harshberger v. Harshberger, 2006 ND 245, 724 N.W.2d 148, 2006

                            Although North Dakota may have home-state jurisdiction over a child custody case, federal law has limited its authority in cases where other states may validly exercise continuing jurisdiction and have not declined to do so under the Parental Kidnapping

                            “Home state” of the child refers not to the state of the child’s legal residence, but to the state of the child’s actual physical presence. Bergstrom v. Bergstrom, 271 N.W.2d 546, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite>                            (N.D. 1978).

                            The district court did not err in refusing to exercise jurisdiction over father’s petition to modify visitation provisions of divorce decree under subdivision 1 a of this section where Iowa, and not North Dakota, was currently the children’s home state,
                            in which they had resided with their custodial parent for more than three years. Dennis v. Dennis, 366 N.W.2d 474, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1985).

                            Where child lived with father for at least six consecutive months in New York before the commencement of mother’s proceeding in this state, the district court properly determined that New York, and not North Dakota, was the home state of the child under
                            the provisions of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. Anderson v. Anderson, 449 N.W.2d 799, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 246</cite> (N.D. 1989).

                        <p>
                            Neither the children nor the parents lived in North Dakota. Therefore, North Dakota no longer had jurisdiction to modify the custody decree. Long v. Long, 439 N.W.2d 523, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 84</cite> (N.D.

                            Where a child was placed with her grandparents in North Dakota by the custodial parent’s own action and initiative, and was fed, clothed, and cared for, the grandparents had a right to custody superior to all except the custodial parent because their
                            actions embodied the common-sense definition of a person acting as a parent; the child thus lived with “persons acting as parents” and North Dakota was the child’s home state. Hangsleben v. Oliver, 502 N.W.2d 838, 1993

                            Where children were born in North Dakota and resided there their entire lives until mother began proceedings in August 1992, the North Dakota district court had jurisdiction, because this was the children’s home state within six months before the proceedings
                            began, the children’s father continues to live here, and the children were absent from this state only because they were removed by their mother. Smith v. Smith, 534 N.W.2d 6, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite>                            (N.D. 1995).

                            Although the requirements for personal jurisdiction may vary, a state court must nevertheless have subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the child custody and support matters that often arise in a divorce action; this state furnishes subject matter

                            Some judicial powers over custody and visitation can continue in this state even after children are allowed to live in another state, furthermore, California has the same Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act as this state and is equally subject to the
                            Federal Parental Kidnapping Protection Act, 28 USCS § 1738A. Therefore, a non-custodial parent, whose children were granted a right to move to California, had adequate procedures available to assure continuation of meaningful
                            relationships with his children. Hedstrom v. Berg, 421 N.W.2d 488, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1988).

                            District court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to decide a mother’s motion to amend a Washington judgment because the statutory requirements were not satisfied where the Washington court had not determined that it no longer had exclusive,

                            the states was required since Washington had already issued its initial child custody determination and a separate child custody proceeding was not pending. Instasi v. Hiebert, 2020 ND 180, 948 N.W.2d 25, 2020

                            District court correctly dismissed a mother’s custody petition for a lack of jurisdiction where a Wisconsin court indicated that it had exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the custody and placement of the child and had denied the mother’s motion
                            to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, Wisconsin was the child’s home state under the UCCJEA, and the Wisconsin court did not determine that North Dakota was a more appropriate forum. Schweitzer v. Miller, 2020

                            District court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to decide a mother’s motion to amend a Washington judgment because the statutory requirements were not satisfied where the Washington court had not determined that it no longer had exclusive,
                            continuing jurisdiction or that North Dakota would be a more convenient forum, and neither North Dakota nor Washington had determined that both parents and the children reside outside of Washington, and no communication between
                            the states was required since Washington had already issued its initial child custody determination and a separate child custody proceeding was not pending. Instasi v. Hiebert, 2020 ND 180, 948 N.W.2d 25, 2020

                            District court's finding that each party would be equally inconvenienced in either forum was not arbitrary or unreasonable because there were witnesses and parties in both Iowa and North Dakota, and both parties were going to be inconvenienced in some
                            way, regardless of which state the proceedings occur. State ex rel. Klein v. Winegar, 2017 ND 106, 893 N.W.2d 741, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 2017).

                            Because both Iowa and North Dakota possessed substantial, relevant evidence about a child's care, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the nature and location of the evidence favored neither party. State ex rel. Klein v. Winegar,

                            District court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the familiarity of the court with the facts and issues favored North Dakota because Iowa courts had no familiarity with the facts or issues of the case. State ex rel. Klein v. Winegar, 2017 ND

                            Because the district court did not partake in any improper analysis under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act, and its reasoning to each of the factors was not arbitrary or unreasonable, the district court did not abuse its discretion
                            when it found North Dakota to be a convenient forum; the district court's use of a prior decision's analysis was to supplement its analysis of the statute, not replace it. State ex rel. Klein v. Winegar, 2017 ND 106, 893 N.W.2d

                            District court erred in determining that North Dakota was an inconvenient forum to resolve a visitation issue under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-14.1s14-14.1-18" target="_self">14-14.1-18</a></cite>,

                            This chapter requires that a court make a two-pronged inquiry to determine whether it should entertain a child-custody proceeding having interstate implications: it must first determine whether it has jurisdiction under former N.D.C.C. § 14-14-03 (see

                            Father requested that the North Dakota trial court allow his Minnesota motion to go forward because Minnesota still had jurisdiction over the custody of the child; the father’s jurisdictional argument, however, did not fall within N.D.C.C. §

                            The right to custody given to the mother of an illegitimate child necessarily implies the right to full control over the child, including the power and right to place the child with others for adoption, and where the child has not been legitimated, her
                            consent to the child’s adoption is all that is required. In re Klundt, 196 N.W.2d 76, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 1972).

                            Termination of a father's parental rights was appropriate, and his consent to the adoption was not required, because the evidence supported the district court's finding the father abandoned the child; the father's conduct supports an inference he intended
                            to abandon the child because the father had only seen the child, who was four years old, two times since the child was born, and the father did not provide any financial support for the child. K.B.C. v. K.J.C. (In re K.J.C.),

                            Abandonment is a question of fact which must be established by clear and convincing evidence; in determining whether abandonment has taken place, the court looks to such factors as the parent’s contact and communication with the child, the parent’s love,
                            care and affection toward the child, and the parent’s intent. Also relevant is the parent’s acceptance of parental obligations, such as to care for, protect, support, educate, give moral guidance to, and provide a home for
                            the child. R.A.K. v. M.E.Z. (In re A.M.B.), 514 N.W.2d 670, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 76</cite> (N.D. 1994).

                            Natural father’s consent to the adoption of child was not required where court found that, from a few months after child’s birth in July 1990 until the time of motion for adoption in December 1992, there was an absence of contact and communication with
                            child, an absence of love, care and affection for the child, and a failure to support and to otherwise perform parental duties; the evidence was clear and convincing that father had abandoned child. R.A.K. v. M.E.Z. (In re

                            Although father, at the beginning, did foster what appeared to be a caring, loving relationship with his daughter, after she moved and these contacts became more difficult, instead of persisting in his efforts to remain close, his efforts appear to have
                            ceased entirely for an 18-month span; while some decrease in the number of contacts after the move would be expected, complete cessation due to inconvenience supported the trial court’s finding of abandonment. S.P.M. v. Department

                            In case in which a biological father appealed from an order terminating his parental rights to his child and from an order granting a petition for adoption of the child, the evidence showed the biological father did not take any affirmative steps to foster
                            a relationship with the child and displayed only a casual interest in the child. The evidence supported the district court’s finding that the biological father had abandoned the child. M.M.R. v. D.E.L. (In re I.R.R.), 2013

                            Noncustodial parent failed significantly without justifiable cause to communicate with his children for one year, and therefore his consent to their adoption was not required, where during the year period he saw the children only twice and one of the
                            contacts was initiated by the children, he lived only twelve blocks away from the children, his employment did not require him to be absent from town for continued long periods of time, and the custodial parent placed no barriers

                            Where the parental rights of a natural parent are to be terminated by a decree of adoption, the trial court is not required as a matter of law to grant a continuance where the natural parent does not appear at the adoption hearing. Mortenson v. Tangedahl,

                            Although the estate representative contesting the finding that the adopted woman was a proper devisee of decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father, claimed that the trial court should have applied North Dakota’s Revised Uniform

As
                            a result, the adopted woman could be found to be a proper devisee despite the fact that result might not have occurred had the Adoption Act been applied. Kraft v. Ramos (In re Estate of Boehm), 2012 ND 104, 816 N.W.2d 793,

                        A legal adoption is necessary to establish a child’s right to inherit from a person claimed to be his adopted parent. Borner v. Larson, 70 N.D. 313, 293 N.W. 836, 1940 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 1940).

                        Under former section, adopted children, insofar as the “legal consequences and incidents of the natural relation of parent and child” were concerned, were as much the children of the adopting parent as if they were born to him in lawful wedlock; and those
                        consequences and incidents included the right of inheritance, when that was conferred on children. Borner v. Larson, 70 N.D. 313, 293 N.W. 836, 1940 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 175</cite> (N.D. 1940).

                    <p>
                        In order to establish the right of an illegitimate child to inherit as a natural child by an adoption under former statute, the record was required to show that deceased was claimant’s natural father; that he publicly acknowledged himself to be such father;
                        that, with the consent of his wife, he received the claimant into his family; and that he otherwise treated him as his legitimate child. In re Berg's Estate, 72 N.D. 52, 4 N.W.2d 575, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 111</cite>                        (N.D. 1942).

                    <p>
                        Former statute placed adopted children in the same position as far as possible as children born in lawful wedlock, including the right of inheritance from the adopting parents and placed them by law in the line of descent to all intents and purposes the
                        same as children born in lawful wedlock were placed there by birth. Heollinger v. Molzohn, 77 N.D. 108, 41 N.W.2d 217, 1950 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 110</cite> (N.D. 1950).

                            Parties had the right to appeal from an interlocutory decree of adoption where the interlocutory decree did not state that a subsequent hearing was required but provided that the decree was to become final on a certain date, which was a few days more
                            than six months after its issuance. Schneider v. S.L.M., 347 N.W.2d 126, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 267</cite> (N.D. 1984).

                            Due process requires that before a divorced parent’s parental rights may be terminated pursuant to subsection 3 of this section, he must either consent to the termination or be given a hearing to determine his fitness, and notwithstanding the language

                            Evidence was sufficient to establish divorced father had abandoned his children for purposes of terminating his parental rights in connection with an adoption proceeding where, although he made his child support payments generally during periods of employment
                            and was clearing up his arrearages at the time of the adoption proceeding, there had been a period of over a year when no support payments had been made and the continuation of support payments and the reduction of arrearages
                            were made in an effort to avoid a jail sentence rather than to continue his parental responsibilities; he made no contacts or attempted contacts with the children between December of 1978 and the commencement of the adoption
                            proceeding on January 29, 1979; he sent no Christmas or birthday cards or gifts to the children from 1976 to 1980; and he had made limited attempts to contact the children and had had only two visitations with them from 1975
                            to 1980. In re Adoption of Gotvaslee, 312 N.W.2d 308, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 404</cite> (N.D. 1981).

                            no support payments even though he could have designated part of his monthly income from employment at the penitentiary for the child’s support, and his unavailability and incapacity due to his incarceration were likely to

                            District court did not clearly err in denying the petitions of a child’s biological mother and the mother’s new husband to terminate the biological father’s parental rights and to allow the mother’s husband to adopt the child because the evidence did
                            not support a finding of abandonment by the biological father where it showed that the father made some monetary contributions to the support of his child, that he spoke with the child several times a week by telephone, and
                            that the mother had refused numerous visitation requests by the father because the requested times were inconvenient for her. Because the evidence failed to establish the father’s intent to abandon the child, the district court

                            District court found a father had abandoned his minor child because the father had not had any significant meaningful contact with the child since March 2006, he had not had a substantial relationship with the child since 2004, he did not provide any
                            financial support for the child for two years and support was otherwise sporadic, and he knew how to contact the child’s mother but failed to do so; because the district court’s findings that the father abandoned the child
                            were not clearly erroneous, termination of the father’s parental rights was warranted under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t14c14-15s14-15-19" target="_self">14-15-19</a></cite>(3)(a). B.A.C.

                            District court properly terminated a father’s parental rights because the father had not exercised parental care for his two minor children, had not contributed in any positive way to the children’s physical, mental, or emotional health, or their morals,
                            the children were without a stable living environment, received inadequate medical care, were exposed to violence and drug usage, and were not given the love and affection necessary for an infant to establish that most important
                            requirement of emotional bonding, and there was no evidence presented to provide any reasonable expectation that such deprivation of the children, by the father’s misconduct, faults, habits, and neglect, would stop, or in any
                            way be remedied, in the near future. A.S. C.N.D. v. C.M.A.S., 2018 ND 265, 920 N.W.2d 301, 2018 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 276</cite> (N.D. 2018).

                    a child-placing agency licensed under chapter 50-12. The parent may retain counsel of the parent’s own choosing and at the parent’s own expense, or, if indigent, the parent may request the court to order, upon which the court shall
                    order, that a state’s attorney serve as legal counsel to the parent at no cost to the parent. As an alternative to the state’s attorney serving as legal counsel to the parent, the state’s attorney may request the court to order, upon
                    which the court may order, if a conflict is shown to exist, that other legal counsel services that may be available be provided to the parent at no cost to the parent. These alternative legal counsel services include counsel services

                        Termination of the father’s parental rights to his son was inappropriate and a new trial was warranted because the district court erred by not informing him of his right to court-appointed counsel and by not deciding whether the father qualified for court-appointed
                        counsel in the proceeding. Because the father was unable to effectively articulate his cause without any legal assistance, the district court’s failure to inform him of his right to court-appointed counsel affected the father’s
                        substantial rights and therefore was not harmless error. D.D.F. v. N.D. Dep't of Human Servs. (In re Adoption of J.D.F.), 2009 ND 21, 761 N.W.2d 582, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D.

                    husband, if a party to the agreement, is the father of the child. If the surrogate’s husband is not a party to the agreement or the surrogate is unmarried, paternity of the child is governed by chapter 14-20.
