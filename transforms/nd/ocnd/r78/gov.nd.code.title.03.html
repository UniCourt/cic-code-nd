        It was not error for a trial court to grant a new trial on the basis of the court’s determination that a failure to instruct properly as to agency resulted in a miscarriage of justice and had a tendency to confuse the jury.

        District court's finding that a limited liability company (LLC) did not breach a fiduciary duty in acquiring oil and gas leases for an oil and gas company was not clearly erroneous because no fiduciary duty precluded the LLC from acquiring the leases after its authority to acquire leases had been terminated; the parties' written contract was silent on the question of a fiduciary duty.

        In the formation of the agency relationship it is necessary that the principal shall, either expressly or by implication from conduct for which he is responsible, appoint the agent, and it is equally essential that the agent accept the appointment. Lander v. Hartson, 77 N.D. 923, 47 N.W.2d 211, 1951 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 1951).

        Credit company was permitted to file an agricultural supplier’s lien for supplies, even though it was not the seller of such, because it was an agent for the seller, pursuant to an agency agreement. The credit company was the actual agent of the seller for the purpose of collecting account receivables, which gave it the authority to file such a lien.
   Stockman Bank v. AGSCO, Inc., 2007 ND 26, 728 N.W.2d 142, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 31</cite> (N.D. 2007).

        N.D.C.C. § 38-18.1-04 allows an owner’s representative to record a statement of claim and does not require the owner of the mineral interest to record the claim. Therefore, a mineral interest did not lapse in quiet title action; the statute of frauds did not apply since there was not a transfer of real property, and an agreement by several heirs to have two people act as their representatives was not required to be in writing.

      An agency is either actual or ostensible. It is actual when the agent really is employed by the principal. It is ostensible when the principal intentionally or by want of ordinary care causes a third person to believe another to be the principal’s agent, who really is not employed by the principal.

        Agency is a question of fact to be decided by the trial court. Supreme court will not disturb a trial court’s finding of agency unless it is clearly erroneous. Red River Commodities v. Eidsness, 459 N.W.2d 805, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        How a principal and agent describe their relationship between themselves does not regulate their relationship to others. If an act done by one person on behalf of another is in its essential nature one of agency, then he is an agent regardless of the title bestowed upon him. Red River Commodities v. Eidsness, 459 N.W.2d 805, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        Actual agency existed between a scrap metal purchaser and buyer where the purchaser advanced $ 30,000 to the buyer and the buyer was authorized to purchase the seller’s scrap metal with the funds, with the expectation that it be delivered to the purchaser after the purchase.

       <p>
        If a principal allows the purchaser of realty to believe that an agent has authority to receive payment of the purchase price, the agent has ostensible authority to receive such payment. First Nat'l Bank v. Henry, 30 N.D. 324, 152 N.W. 668, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 1915).

        It is not fair to assume that any person is chargeable with notice of all the little confidential talks between a husband and wife, and where a wife gave a deed into her husband’s hands for delivery to a bank to secure some notes, the circumstances indicated that the husband had ostensible authority to deliver the deed as security for his debts. Farmers' Sec. Bank v. Verry, 42 N.D. 264, 172 N.W. 867, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 153</cite> (N.D. 1919).

       <p>
        Where the principal holds the agent out as having power to endorse negotiable instruments or permits him to act as if he possessed such power under circumstances inducing those dealing with him reasonably to rely on its existence, an apparent authority arises under which persons accepting commercial paper from the agent will be protected. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. v. First Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 71 N.D. 415, 1 N.W.2d 401, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 182</cite> (N.D. 1941).

        Evidence clearly supported the trial court’s finding that farmer was an agent of seed company in dealing with plaintiff, where plaintiff had bought seed corn from seed company for several years before purchasing through farmer, who told him in 1984 that he was a “salesman” for seed company, where seed company provided the order forms and delivery receipts, preprinted with its emblem, for use by farmer, where after plaintiff discovered that the wrong seed had been delivered, he contacted an area supervisor for seed company, who in turn contacted seed company’s district manager, where the district sales manager contacted plaintiff and negotiated for a possible adjustment with him, and where seed company handled orders from farmer by credit with complete allowance for all returns.

         Essential Features of Ostensible Agency.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The essential features of an ostensible agency are that the third party must have believed in the existence of the authority in the supposed agent, and such belief must rest upon some act or statement of the principal sought to be bound by the alleged authority. Bernard v. Madsen, 52 N.D. 822, 204 N.W. 196, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 1925); Scherbenske v. Maier, 71 N.W.2d 770, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        An ostensible agency exists where the conduct of the supposed agent is consistent with an agency, and where, in a particular transaction, someone is justified in dealing with the supposed agent. Krank v. A.O. Smith Harvestore Prods., 456 N.W.2d 125, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1990); Red River Commodities v. Eidsness, 459 N.W.2d 805, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        Appellant’s claim that dismissal of various parties pursuant to NDRCivP 50 was error because they were allegedly affiliated with a social worker whom the patient filed suit against under a claim of professional malpractice lacked merit; there was no clear and convincing evidence to show that the social worker and the dismissed parties were in an ostensible agency or ostensible partnership for purposes of the dismissed parties’
   liability, as there was no showing that they knowingly held themselves out as partners of the social worker or that they acted in such a way to cause the patient to believe there was an agency or partnership relationship.

       The declarations of an agent, not made while acting within the scope of his agency, are not binding on the principal. Rounseville v. Paulson, 19 N.D. 466, 126 N.W. 221, 1910 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 51</cite> (N.D. 1910).

     </h3>
     <p>
      An agent has such authority as the principal actually or ostensibly confers upon the agent. Actual authority is such as a principal intentionally confers upon the agent or intentionally or by want of ordinary care allows the agent to believe the agent possesses. Ostensible authority is such as the principal intentionally or by want of ordinary care causes or allows a third person to believe the agent possesses.

        The extent of the authority of an agent depends on the will of the principal, and the latter will be bound by the acts of the agent only to the extent of authority, actual or apparent, which he has conferred on the agent. Corey v. Hunter, 10 N.D. 5, 84 N.W. 570 (1900), explained, Grant County State Bank v. Northwestern Land Co., 28 N.D. 479, 150 N.W. 736 (1914), distinguished, Bernard v. Madsen, 52 N.D. 822, 204 N.W. 196 (1925) and Robinson v. Swenson, 54 N.D. 573, 209 N.W. 982, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 49</cite> (N.D. 1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        “Ostensible authority” of an agent is based upon the principle of estoppel and rests upon the conduct and communications of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, cause a third person to believe that the agent has authority to act for and on behalf of the principal. Stoffels v. Brown, 37 N.D. 272, 163 N.W. 834, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1917); McLane v. F. H. Peavey &amp; Co., 72 N.D. 468, 8 N.W.2d 308, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        There must have been some conduct on the part of the principal reasonably resulting in the belief in the mind of the third party, that an agency existed together with a reliance thereon. Bernard v. Madsen, 52 N.D. 822, 204 N.W. 196, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 1925); Scherbenske v. Maier, 71 N.W.2d 770, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 133</cite> (N.D. 1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        An agent has no authority other than that conferred upon him by this statute. Fargo Nat'l Bank v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 184 F.2d 676 (8th Cir. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        How a principal and agent describe their relationship between themselves does not regulate their relationship to others. If an act done by one person on behalf of another is in its essential nature one of agency, then he is an agent regardless of the title bestowed upon him. Red River Commodities v. Eidsness, 459 N.W.2d 805, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 1990).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The authority of an agent to collect money or receive payment, like his authority generally, is to be determined in the light of all circumstances surrounding the parties, and the business transactions. First Nat'l Bank v. Henry, 30 N.D. 324, 152 N.W. 668, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        The person paying notes to the owner’s agent is entitled to a discharge of the mortgage securing them, regardless of lack of knowledge of the agency. Swarthout v. Meyers, 56 N.D. 301, 217 N.W. 160, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 101</cite> (N.D. 1927).

       <p>
        Instructions to or limitations on the powers of the general agent which are not disclosed do not affect apparent powers, and though the agent exceeds his authority, he will bind the principal if the acts are within the scope of his apparent authority. Michigan Idaho Lumber Co. v. Northern Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 35 N.D. 244, 160 N.W. 130, 1916 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 159</cite> (N.D. 1916).

       <p>
        When a special agent acts under a special and limited authority he cannot bind his principal by any act in excess thereof. Winkel v. Atlas Lumber Co., 36 N.D. 542, 162 N.W. 364, 1917 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 184</cite> (N.D. 1917).

       <p>
        An agent authorized merely to collect a debt cannot bind the principal by any arrangement short of an actual collection and receipt of money. Meyer v. National Fire Ins. Co., 67 N.D. 77, 269 N.W. 845, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 154</cite> (N.D. 1936).

       </p>
       <p>
        Actual authority to act for and bind a corporation may be presumed from acts of recognition in other instances when such power was in fact exercised. McIntosh v. Dakota Trust Co., 52 N.D. 752, 204 N.W. 818, 1925 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 146</cite> (N.D. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        The actions of the agent which indicate authority beyond carrying on the mere general affairs must be open and notorious so that it is presumed the corporation knew what he was doing, and coincided with it.

        Ostensible authority is also called apparent authority and it is such as the principal intentionally or by want of ordinary care causes or allows a third person to believe the agent to possess; principal is bound by agent’s acts under ostensible authority only to third persons who have incurred a liability in good faith and without ordinary negligence.

        Where a principal intentionally or by want of ordinary care permits the agent to believe that he has authority to receive the purchase price, the agent has such authority. First Nat'l Bank v. Henry, 30 N.D. 324, 152 N.W. 668, 1915 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 128</cite> (N.D. 1915).

        The presumption is that the agent who has possession of the security has authority to make collection thereof; but the agent who does not have such possession has no authority to collect.

        Even if payee corporation was negligent or conduct warranted finding of ostensible authority conferred upon district manager who cashed corporation checks and diverted funds into personal bank account, such facts would not bar recovery by corporation from bank where manager’s conduct did not in any way induce bank to rely blindly on genuineness of his endorsement.

        Where an agent has, in certain instances, been authorized to run the business of another and to sign checks as well as other negotiable instruments in the course of conducting the principal’s business in the past, it cannot be said as a matter of law that the agent had no ostensible authority to approve an agreement settling tort liability, and the question of whether such ostensible authority existed was a jury question.

        The benefit of this statute could be had under the ostensible authority of an agent only by those who without ordinary negligence had parted with value upon the faith of ostensible authority of the agent. Fargo Nat'l Bank v. Agricultural Ins. Co., 184 F.2d 676 (8th Cir. 1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was evidence that a
   corporation intentionally or by want of ordinary care caused a lessor to believe the purported president of the corporation was authorized to enter into a sale-and-leaseback arrangement where the other members of the corporation permitted the purported president to initially acquire the airplane and, as part of this acquisition, the purported president executed a purchase agreement as the president of the corporation, the other members of the corporation seemingly never inspected this document nor objected to the purported president’s representation, two title searches, one of which relied on Federal Aviation Administration registration records, revealed the president to be the president of the corporation, and the purported president had control of the corporate checkbook and was the person responsible for drafting and filing the company’s corporate documents.
   Weinreis v. Hill, 2005 ND 127, 700 N.W.2d 692, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 163</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Airplane lessee, a partnership, was not bound by its partner’s actions in holding himself out as its president and entering a sale-lease back transaction because the leasing company had acted negligently; there were problems with the documentation it had received and it deposited the proceeds of the transaction in the partner’s bank account rather than the lessee’s account.

       When the vice president of the bank fraudulently induced a debtor to enter into a $250,000 loan by making false statements, the district court acted properly by imputing his fraud to the bank in accordance with agency law as set forth in N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t03c3-03s3-03-07" target="_self">3-03-07</a></cite>. The bank was not permitted to collect on the loan.

        In light of clear and unambiguous contractual provisions, and evidence before the trial court on the motion for summary judgment, reasonable minds could only reach the conclusion that employee was not acting within the scope of his employment at the time of his alleged negligent conduct; accordingly, summary judgment on this issue was appropriate.

     <p>
      If an agent receives anything for the benefit of the agent’s principal, to the possession of which another person is entitled, the agent on demand must surrender it, or so much of it as the agent has under the agent’s control at the time of the demand, to such other person, on being indemnified for any advance which the agent has made to the agent’s principal in good faith on account of the same. The agent is responsible therefor, if the agent delivers it to the agent’s principal after notice from the owner.

     <p>
      A factor who charges the factor’s principal with a guaranty commission upon a sale thereby assumes absolutely to pay the price when it falls due as if it were a debt of the factor’s own and not as a mere guarantor for the purchaser, but the factor does not thereby assume any additional responsibility for the safety of the factor’s remittance of the proceeds.
