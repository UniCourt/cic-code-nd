    Department to employ waste management facility inspectors.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The department of environmental quality shall employ and establish the qualifications, duties, and compensation of at least one full-time inspector for each commercial, nonpublicly owned waste management disposal or incineration facility that accepts more than twenty-five thousand tons [22679.5 kilograms] per year of hazardous waste, industrial waste, nuclear waste, or ash resulting from the incineration of municipal solid waste. This section does not apply to any energy conversion facility or coal mining operation that disposes of its solid waste onsite. The department may require inspectors for those facilities that accept less than twenty-five thousand tons [22679.5 kilograms] per year. The facility inspector shall conduct regular inspections of the operating procedure and conditions of the facility and report the findings to the department on a regular basis. If an inspector discovers a condition at a facility that is likely to cause imminent harm to the health and safety of the public or environment, the inspector shall notify the department. The department shall proceed as provided by sections 23.1-08-19 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t23.1c23.1-08s23.1-08-20" target="_self">23.1-08-20</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      The department shall assess the owner or operator of a waste management facility that accepts hazardous waste, industrial waste, nuclear waste, or ash resulting from the incineration of municipal solid waste an annual fee to pay the salaries, wages, and operating expenses associated with employing an inspector for the facility. The owner or operator of the facility shall submit the fee to the department by July first of each year. Any fees collected must be deposited in the department’s operating fund in the state treasury and any expenditures from the fund are subject to appropriation by the legislative assembly. If a facility begins operation after July first of any year, the owner or operator of the facility shall pay to the department a prorated fee for the fiscal year before the facility may begin accepting waste. Moneys in the waste management facility account may be spent by the department within the limits of legislative appropriation.

     <p>
      When the department is satisfied an applicant is qualified by examination or otherwise to supervise the operation of treatment plants and systems, the department shall issue a certificate attesting to the competency of the applicant as an operator. The certificate must indicate the classification of treatment plant or system the operator is qualified to supervise.

      <li id="t23.1c23.1-07s23.1-07-04ol11">
       A certificate issued under this chapter is valid for only one year and expires on the first day of July of the year after which it was issued.

      <li id="t23.1c23.1-07s23.1-07-04ol12">
       The department may revoke or suspend the certificate of an operator issued under this chapter if the operator has practiced fraud or deception in obtaining the certificate or in the performance of the operator’s duty as an operator; if reasonable care, judgment, or the application of the operator’s knowledge or ability was not used in the performance of the operator’s duties; or if the operator is incompetent and unable to perform properly the operator’s duties as an operator. A certificate may not be revoked or suspended except after a hearing before the director of the department, or the director’s designated representative. If a certificate is suspended or revoked, a new application for certification may be considered by the department only after the conditions causing the suspension or revocation have been corrected, and evidence of this fact has been satisfactorily submitted to the department. A new certificate may then be granted by the department.

       The department may issue permits for solid waste management facilities and solid waste transporters. A person may not own, operate, or use a facility for solid waste disposal or transport solid wastes without a valid permit. Upon receipt of a permit application, the department shall give public notice, in the official newspaper of the county in which the facility is to be located, that the department is considering an application for a solid waste management facility. The notice must state the name of the applicant, the location of the facility, and a description of the facility. The department shall require as a condition of a permit for a solid waste management facility, not owned or operated by the state or a political subdivision, that any entity that controls the permitholder agrees to accept responsibility for any remedial measures, closure and postclosure care, or penalties incurred by the permitholder. For purposes of this section, “control” means ownership or control, directly, indirectly, or through the actions of one or more persons of the power to vote twenty-five percent or more of any class of voting shares of a permitholder, or the direct or indirect power to control in any manner the election of a majority of the directors of a permitholder, or to direct the management or policies of a permitholder, whether by individuals, corporations, partnerships, trusts, or other entities or organizations of any type. All permits are nontransferable, are for a term of not more than ten years from the date of issuance, and are conditioned upon the observance of the laws of the state and the rules adopted under this chapter.

The board of county commissioners may call a special election to be held within sixty days after receiving notice from the department to allow the qualified electors of the county to vote to approve or disapprove of the facility based on public interest and impact on the environment. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question in the election vote to disapprove of the facility, the department may not issue the permit and the facility may not be located in that county.

       Notwithstanding subsection 2, if the new solid waste management facility will be owned or operated by a solid waste management authority, a special election to approve or disapprove of a facility may be called only if the boards of county commissioners from a majority of the counties in the solid waste management district call for a special election. However, a special election must be conducted in each county within the authority. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question in the election vote to disapprove of the facility, the department may not issue the permit.

      This chapter establishes a degradation prevention program to protect ground water resources, encourage the wise use of agricultural chemicals, provide for public education regarding preservation of ground water resources, and provide for safe disposal of wastes in a manner that will not endanger the state’s ground water resource. Waters of the state must be maintained within standards established under this chapter unless it can be affirmatively demonstrated that a change in quality is justifiable to provide necessary economic or social development and will not adversely affect the beneficial uses of water.

     <p>
      No later than the twenty-fifth day of each calendar month, every person licensed by the tax commissioner as a motor vehicle fuel, special fuels, or liquefied petroleum wholesale dealer shall send to the tax commissioner a correct report of all purchases and sales of gasoline, kerosene, tractor fuel, heating oil, or diesel fuel during the preceding month. The report must include the same information as required in chapters 57-43.1 and 57-43.2 for motor vehicle fuel and special fuels tax collection purposes. Failure to send the report and inspection fee required by the preceding section to the tax commissioner constitutes a violation of the provisions of this chapter.

     <p>
      The tax commissioner may require any person licensed by the tax commissioner as a motor vehicle fuel, special fuels, or liquefied petroleum wholesale dealer to furnish a surety bond payable to the state in the sum of five hundred dollars, or twice the amount of inspection fees due for any calendar month, whichever amount is the greater, guaranteeing to the state true reports of purchases and sales of gasoline, kerosene, tractor fuel, heating oil, and diesel fuel and the payment of all inspection fees provided for in this chapter. The tax commissioner shall determine the sufficiency of the bond. A single bond may cover dealing in one or all of the petroleum products mentioned in this chapter. When any inspection fee is not paid within twenty days after it has become delinquent, the person bonding the delinquent may be called upon to make good upon the bond for such delinquent fees.

     <p>
      The department may designate ports of entry of all transportation companies carrying petroleum products into this state for sale or consignment and may hold or delay any car or other vehicle of transportation entering this state carrying such products for sale or consignment until samples thereof have been obtained for inspection and analysis and until any other required information regarding the products contained in the shipment has been secured. The department may not hold or delay any shipment or consignment of petroleum products at the port of entry if the transportation company carrying such products will permit proper inspection and sampling of shipments or consignments at convenient designated points without the state, and will permit the inspection of transportation records and provide adequate information regarding the records of cars or other vehicles carrying such products at division points or at other places within or without the state where such cars or other vehicles, in normal practice, are stopped and held for switching and rearrangement or where ample opportunity is provided for proper inspection and sampling. The failure on the part of a transportation company or any of its officers or employees to hold any car or other vehicle of transportation for inspection is a class B misdemeanor.

      Before antifreeze may be distributed in this state, the manufacturer or person whose name appears on the label shall apply to the department on forms provided by the department for registration for each antifreeze the manufacturer or person whose name appears on the label desires to distribute. All registrations expire on June thirtieth of each year. The application for registration must be accompanied by an inspection fee of forty dollars for each product, and by a label or other printed matter describing the product. Upon approval by the department, a copy of the registration must be furnished to the applicant. The department shall remit inspection fees received by the department to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general fund. A penalty of fifty percent of the registration fee must be imposed if the certificate of registration is not applied for on or before July first of each year or within the same month such antifreeze is first manufactured or sold within this state.

The department shall release for distribution the lot of antifreeze so withdrawn upon compliance with applicable rules, or for return to the registrant or the person whose name and address appears on the label for reprocessing or relabeling as may be required. If compliance is not obtained within thirty days, the department may begin proceedings for condemnation. Any lot of antifreeze not in compliance with the law is subject to seizure upon complaint of the department in the district court of the county in which it is located or in the district court of Burleigh County.

The notice must set forth the date and place of the taking, the year, make, model, and serial number of the abandoned motor vehicle, and the place where the vehicle is being held, must inform the owner and any lienholders or secured parties of their right to reclaim the vehicle under section 23.1-15-06, must state that failure of the owner, lienholders, or secured parties to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle within thirty days is deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders, or secured parties of all right, title, and interest in the vehicle and a consent to the disposal of the vehicle pursuant to section 23.1-15-07, and must state the end date of the thirty-day period during which the owner may reclaim the abandoned vehicle.

When posted on a website, the notice must be placed in a designated area on the official website for a minimum of thirty days and must include the information in subsection 1. Published notices may be grouped together for convenience and economy. Failure of the owner, lienholders, or secured parties to exercise the right to reclaim the vehicle by the end of the public notice period is deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders, or secured parties of all right, title, and interests in the vehicle and a consent to the disposal of the vehicle pursuant to section 23.1-15-07.
