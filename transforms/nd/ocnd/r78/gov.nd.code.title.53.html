        Purpose of Statute.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The regulatory statutes contained in this chapter show a legislative intent to surround dances and public dancing with all the protection possible against such unwholesome, harmful, or bad influences as may possibly arise surrounding them or be associated with the conduct of a public dance.
   State v. Johnson, 88 N.W.2d 209, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 67</cite>, decided prior to the adoption of N.D.R.Crim.P. 29.

        “Guardian.”
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Under repealed section 53-02-10, prohibiting admission of minors to public dance unless accompanied by parent or guardian, “guardian” referred to person occupying, under the law, the relation created by natural law between a parent and child or created by order of court; neither accompaniment of minor by a chaperone, escort, neighbor or adult friend who might supervise such minor at dance or authorization by parents for owner or proprietor of public dancing place to admit and supervise their minor child satisfied the requirement that minor be accompanied by parent or guardian; responsibility of complying with statute rested upon licensee and he was responsible for admission of minors by his employees; no criminal intent or guilty knowledge was required for violation of statute.
   State v. Johnson, 88 N.W.2d 209 (N.D. 1958), overruled on other grounds, State v. Allen, 237 N.W.2d 154 (N.D. 1975), decided prior to the adoption of N.D.R.Crim.P. 29.

      The sheriff in any county in which any public dance, music festival, or public concert is held outside of an incorporated city, and the chief peace officer of the city where the dance, music festival, or public concert is held within the limits of a city, may police the dance, music festival, or public concert so that law and order are there maintained. The sheriff or the chief peace officer shall determine the number, if any, of deputy sheriffs, special officers, or licensed private security officers needed to police the dance, music festival, or public concert properly. The person conducting the dance, music festival, or public concert, before the dance, music festival, or public concert is held, shall pay to the sheriff, peace officer, or licensed private security provider the expense of any deputy sheriff, special officer, or licensed private security officer required for the proper policing of the dance, music festival, or public concert, and no dance, music festival, or public concert may be permitted to proceed unless the officer or officers are present and the fees are paid. The holding of a dance, music festival, or public concert without giving notice of the dance, music festival, or public concert to the sheriff of the county or the peace officer of the city, and without making provision for the policing of the dance, music festival, or public concert, is unlawful. No person, directly or indirectly interested or concerned in the giving, holding, or conducting of a public dance, music festival, or public concert, or connected with the person conducting the same, is eligible to appointment under this section as a special officer.

       A “juke box” was not an “amusement game” and where the title of S.L. 1941, ch. 181 restricted the act to amusement games, the requirement that “juke boxes” be licensed was unconstitutional. Dornacker v. Strutz, 71 N.D. 449, 1 N.W.2d 614, 1941 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 185</cite> (N.D. 1941).

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person may not operate, lease, or distribute an amusement game or device without first having obtained an annual license.
     </p>
     <p>
      Licenses are of two types. An operator’s license entitles the licensee to operate, lease, or distribute machines at locations not owned or managed by the licensee. The operator shall affix to each machine an operator’s number provided by the attorney general. The operator shall have a business office within the state and a valid sales tax permit. A location license must be secured by an individual for any establishment managed or owned by that person. A location license entitles the licensee to have not more than ten machines at one location managed or owned by that individual. An individual is not entitled to more than one location license. The location license must be displayed on or near the machines.
     </p>
     <p>
      The annual fee for an operator’s license is one thousand dollars. The annual fee for a location license is twenty-five dollars per machine.
     </p>
     <p>
      A reinstatement fee of one hundred dollars for an operator’s license renewal and fifty dollars for a location license renewal is required in addition to the annual license fee for each license renewal applied for after June thirtieth.

       The state gaming commission consists of the chairman and four other members appointed by the governor, with the consent of the senate. The members serve three-year terms and until a successor is appointed and qualified. If the senate is not in session when the term of a member expires, the governor may make an interim appointment, and the interim appointee holds office until the senate confirms or rejects the appointment. A member appointed to fill a vacancy arising from other than the natural expiration of a term serves only for the unexpired portion of the term. The terms of the commissioners must be staggered so no more than two terms expire each July first.

      The organization shall provide playing chips of various denominations to players although the organization may use a metal coin rather than a fifty-cent chip. The organization may set the minimum limit for the original wager at not more than three dollars on one active table. If there is more than one active table at a site, the organization may set a higher minimum wager on additional tables. The maximum limit per wager may be set by the organization at not more than twenty-five dollars. Wagers in increments of one dollar must be accepted between the posted minimum and the posted maximum limit. A player may not play more than two hands at the same time. Only the player actually playing a hand may place a wager on that hand. Each player plays the player’s hand against the dealer’s hand. Any requirement to pool tips is within the sole discretion of each organization. Except for a site that has twenty-one gross proceeds averaging less than ten thousand dollars per quarter, an organization may not conduct twenty-one at the site with wagers exceeding two dollars unless the organization has first installed video surveillance equipment as required by rules and the equipment is approved by the attorney general.

       A North Dakota racing commission is established consisting of the chairman and four other members appointed by the governor. One of the members must be appointed from a list of four nominees, one of whom is nominated by the state chapter or affiliate of the American quarter horse racing association, one of whom is nominated by the state chapter or affiliate of the United States trotting association, one of whom is nominated by the state chapter or affiliate of the international Arabian horse association, and one of whom is nominated by the state chapter or affiliate of the North Dakota thoroughbred association. The members serve five-year terms and until a successor is appointed and qualified. A member appointed to fill a vacancy arising from other than the natural expiration of a term serves for the unexpired portion of the term and may be reappointed. The terms of the commissioners must be staggered so that one term expires each July first. At the expiration of the five-year term of each incumbent member of the commission, the governor shall appoint a new member to the commission.

Failure to maintain compliance with this subsection is grounds for removal from the commission or from employment with the commission. For purposes of this section, a person has a financial interest in racing if that person has an ownership interest in horses running at live or simulcast meets conducted or shown in this state subject to this chapter or rules of the commission, is required to be licensed under this chapter or the rules of the commission, or who derives any direct financial benefit from racing, individually or by or through an entity or other person, as regulated by this chapter or the rules of the commission.

       Former Director of Racing for the North Dakota Racing Commission was not liable to a racing simulcast provider and its owner under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 for enforcing the rules and regulations that existed when the state and federal cases against them were filed because his statutory duties were limited to enforcing the rules and orders of the North Dakota Racing Commission and performing other duties the Racing Commission prescribed under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t53c53-06.2s53-06.2-13" target="_self">53-06.2-13</a></cite>. He was also not liable for the Racing Commission’s failure to promulgate new administrative regulations to control account wagering activities because the power to implement new regulations rested with the North Dakota Racing Commission under N.D.C.C. § 53-06.2-05, not the director.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The certificate system allows a licensee to receive money from any person present at a live horse race, simulcast horse race, or simulcast dog race who desires to bet on any entry in that race. A person betting on an entry to win acquires an interest in the total money bet on all entries in the race, in proportion to the amount of money bet by that person, under rules adopted by the commission. The licensee shall receive the bets and for each bet shall issue a certificate to the bettor on which is at least shown the number of the race, the amount bet, and the number or name of the entry selected by the bettor. The commission may adopt rules for place, show, quinella, combination, or other types of betting usually connected with racing.

    Simulcast wagering.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to racing under the certificate system, as authorized by this chapter, and conducted upon the premises of a racetrack, simulcast pari-mutuel and account wagering may be conducted in accordance with this chapter or rules adopted by the commission under this chapter in accordance with chapter 28-32. Any organization qualified under section 53-06.2-06 to conduct racing may make written application to the commission for the conduct of simulcast pari-mutuel and account wagering on races held at licensed racetracks inside the state or racetracks outside the state, or both. Licensure of service providers, totalizator companies, site operators, or organizations applying to conduct or conducting simulcast or account wagering must be approved by the attorney general. The attorney general may not grant a license denied by the commission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the commission may authorize any licensee to participate in interstate or international combined wagering pools with one or more other racing jurisdictions. Anytime that a licensee participates in an interstate or international combined pool, the licensee, as prescribed by the commission, may adopt the take-out of the host jurisdiction or facility. The commission may permit a licensee to use one or more of its races or simulcast programs for an interstate or international combined wagering pool at locations outside its jurisdiction and may allow pari-mutuel pools in other states to be combined with pari-mutuel pools in its jurisdiction for the purpose of establishing an interstate or international combined wagering pool. The participation by a licensee in a combined interstate or international wagering pool does not cause that licensee to be considered to be doing business in any jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the licensee is physically located. Pari-mutuel taxes or commissions may not be imposed on any amounts wagered in an interstate or international combined wagering pool other than amounts wagered within this jurisdiction. The certificate system also permits pari-mutuel wagering to be conducted through account wagering. As used in this section, “account wagering” means a form of pari-mutuel wagering in which an individual deposits money in an account and uses the account balance to pay for pari-mutuel wagers. An account wager made on an account established in this state may only be made through the licensed simulcast service provider approved by the attorney general and authorized by the commission to operate the simulcast pari-mutuel wagering system under the certificate system. The attorney general may not grant a license denied by the commission. An account wager may be made in person, by direct telephone communication, or through other electronic communication in accordance with rules adopted by the commission. Breakage for interstate or international combined wagering pools must be calculated in accordance with the statutes or rules of the host jurisdiction and must be distributed among the participating jurisdictions in a manner agreed to among the jurisdictions.

        Former Director of Racing for the North Dakota Racing Commission was not liable to a racing simulcast provider and its owner under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 for enforcing the rules and regulations that existed when the state and federal cases against them were filed because his statutory duties were limited to enforcing the rules and orders of the North Dakota Racing Commission and performing other duties the Racing Commission prescribed under N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t53c53-06.2s53-06.2-13" target="_self">53-06.2-13</a></cite>. He was also not liable for the Racing Commission’s failure to promulgate new administrative regulations to control account wagering activities because the power to implement new regulations rested with the North Dakota Racing Commission under N.D.C.C. § 53-06.2-05, not the director.

        Racing simulcast provider and its owner were not entitled to recovery under 42 U.S.C.S. § 1983 in their action against the state attorney general because the attorney general’s participation in investigating a charge of illegal gambling operations was consistent with his authority under N.D.C.C. § 53-06.2-13, affording him protection by absolute immunity. Even if he were only protected by qualified immunity, his communications with the receiver did not violate a clearly established constitutional or statutory right of which a reasonable person would have known and he was protected by qualified immunity.

        Where injuries are sustained by a nonpaying recreational user, this chapter precludes liability against the political subdivision for ordinary acts of negligence by its employees which relate to the condition of the property; unless the political subdivision, through its employees, has committed a willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on the property, the political subdivision is not liable.
   Fastow v. Burleigh County Water Resource Dist., 415 N.W.2d 505, 1987 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 427</cite> (N.D. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (1) of section 32-12.1-03 a political subdivision is liable for injury caused from a condition or use of real property only under those circumstances in which a private person would be liable for such injury; this provision unambiguously makes the liability protections of this chapter applicable to political subdivisions in the same manner and under the same circumstances as those protections are applicable to a private owner of recreational land.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under section 32-12.1-05 the defense of governmental immunity is waived when a political subdivision purchases liability insurance coverage; thus, when a political subdivision has such insurance coverage the liability protections afforded under this chapter are inapplicable.

        In an action against a school district for injuries sustained by a student who was rehearsing for a school project, the district court erred when it applied the recreational use statutes, N.D.C.C. ch. 53-08, to bar the claim because those statutes were not intended to relieve school districts of duties owed their students, who were mandated by law to attend their schools.

        Recreational use immunity statutes, N.D.C.C. ch. 53-08, did not bar the vendor’s negligence claims because, although the city’s intent in opening its auditorium may have been for a public recreational use, the vendor’s presence at the auditorium on the day before the seniors event was for employment purposes and not for a recreational purpose where he was there to set up his company’s booth for the event. The plain language of the statute was not so broad as to include a person present on the property for purposes of the person’s employment because, even though the word “includes,” as used in the context of N.D.C.C. § 53-08-01(4), suggested a broadening of the activities which were for “recreational purposes,” the Supreme Court of North Dakota could not conclude it encompassed all activities.

        Premises liability suit, brought after a wife tripped over a pothole in an owner’s parking lot while visiting an exhibition hosted by a church as part of an outreach mission, was wrongly dismissed on summary judgment because there were disputed issues of fact about whether the owner and the church were entitled to recreational use immunity. The church was a rent-paying tenant of the owner’s property; the church held the exhibition as part of a youth outreach program, which was not necessarily congruent with only a recreational purpose; and the church procured sponsors for the exhibition and charged contestants a registration fee to enter the contests.

        District court properly granted summary judgment in favor of a county fair in an attendee's personal injury action because, while the attendee stepped on a rotten board in a grandstand and fell to the ground, the fair was protected from liability by recreational use immunity where the attendee stipulated that the fair was a public entity, the fairgrounds and grandstand were public lands operated solely for the fair's non-profit and tax-exempt purposes, and the attendee did not pay any charge for entry to the fairgrounds, to the grandstand area, or to observe a fireworks display.

         Snowmobiling Accident.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial court did not err in determining that this chapter was applicable to an action arising out of the death of plaintiff’s decedent, who was killed while snowmobiling when he struck an unmarked guy wire of defendant’s on the side of a county road, thereby precluding liability on the part of defendant for ordinary negligence. Grant of summary judgment was reversed on grounds that there was competent admissible evidence upon which a jury could have based an inference of willful or malicious conduct and thus that there were genuine issues of material fact. Stokka v. Cass County Elec. Coop., 373 N.W.2d 911, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 398</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was granted for the landowner because the landowner did not owe any different type of duty to the injured plaintiff if the plaintiff was a trespasser and was snowmobiling on a portion of the land that was posted for no trespassing, because the immunities of the recreational use statute also applied to trespassers. Cudworth v. Midcontinent Communs., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6242 (D.N.D. Apr. 11, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Recreational use immunity statute, N.D.C.C. §
   53-08-01 et seq., operates to absolve landowners of any affirmative duty to entering recreational users as: (1) the statute does not explicitly require that landowners open their property to public use before receiving immunity; (2) the statute does not specify that immunity applies only where entrants are invitees or licensees; and (3) the statute applies regardless of a landowner’s decision to close some or all of its property and irrespective of an entrant’s particular common law status as an invitee, a licensee, or a trespasser. Cudworth v. Midcontinent Communs., 380 F.3d 375, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 17859 (8th Cir. N.D. 2004).

        The legislative history of the recreational use statute does not disclose any reason why a recreational user of public lands could not recover for personal injuries when a non-recreational user could, and without a close correspondence with the legislative goals supporting this classification of user, the statute might fail an equal protection challenge. Hovland v. City of Grand Forks, 1997 ND 95, 563 N.W.2d 384, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 89</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Under the undisputed facts of the case, the recreational use immunity statutes, N.D.C.C. ch. 53-08, advance the important legislative goal of opening property to the public for recreational use in a manner that closely corresponds to the achievement of that goal, and therefore N.D.C.C. ch. 53-08, as applied here, does not violate the equal protection provisions of N.D. Const. art. I, § 21. Olson v. Bismarck Parks &amp; Rec. Dist., 2002 ND 61, 642 N.W.2d 864, 2002 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 2002).

        Trial court erred by granting summary judgment for the city, pursuant to N.D.R.Civ.P. 56(c), in the vendor’s negligence action on the ground of recreational use immunity under N.D.C.C. § 53-08-02 because, although the city’s intent in opening its auditorium may have been for a public recreational use, the vendor’s presence at the auditorium on the day before the seniors event was for employment purposes and not for a recreational purpose where he was setting up his company’s booth for the event. The plain language of the statute was not so broad as to include a person present on the property for purposes of the person’s employment.

       <p>
        Recreational use immunity statute, N.D.C.C. § 53-08-01 et seq., does not protect landowners who engage in a willful and malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on their premises; the term malicious typically means arising from malice, and malice most commonly connotes an intention or desire to harm another. N.D.C.C. §
   53-08-05 does not distinguish between types of malicious conduct, the legislature has not stated that it intends to allow liability for presumed malice or reckless disregard, and therefore the term malicious does not encompass presumed malice, which exists where a defendant’s conduct amounts to a reckless disregard of the rights of others. Cudworth v. Midcontinent Communs., 380 F.3d 375, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 17859 (8th Cir. N.D. 2004).

        District court erred when it held as a matter of law that the exception for willful failure to guard or warn found in this section was not pertinent in case where the plaintiff contended that road was improperly designed, constructed and maintained.

         Snowmobiling Accident.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The trial court did not err in determining that this chapter was applicable to an action arising out of the death of plaintiff’s decedent, who was killed while snowmobiling when he struck an unmarked guy wire of defendant’s on the side of a county road, thereby precluding liability on the part of defendant for ordinary negligence. Grant of summary judgment was reversed on grounds that there was competent admissible evidence upon which a jury could have based an inference of willful or malicious conduct and thus that there were genuine issues of material fact. Stokka v. Cass County Elec. Coop., 373 N.W.2d 911, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 398</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was warranted for the property owner because the plaintiff, who was injured while snowmobiling on the property owner’s land could not show that the property owner was not subject to the immunities set forth in the recreational use statute; the exception to immunity under this section, did not include an exception for presumed malice or reckless disregard of the rights of others. Cudworth v. Midcontinent Communs., 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6242 (D.N.D. Apr. 11, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was properly entered for property owners, who were sued by an injured snowmobile rider and his wife, because the owners were immune from liability as a matter of law under North Dakota’s recreational use immunity statute, N.D.C.C. §
   53-08-01 et seq.; the owners were immune even though they had erected barriers in an attempt to close off part of their property from the public and regardless of whether the rider would be considered, for common law purposes, as an invitee, a licensee, or a trespasser. There was no evidence presented to show that the owners had erected the barriers in order to injure snowmobilers, and the nature of the barrier itself was not sufficient for a jury to infer willful and malicious conduct on the owners’ part. Cudworth v. Midcontinent Communs., 380 F.3d 375, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 17859 (8th Cir. N.D. 2004).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly finds that the sport of skiing is practiced in this state by a growing number of North Dakota citizens and nonresidents. Since it is recognized that there are inherent risks in the sport of skiing which should be understood by each skier and which are essentially impossible to eliminate by the ski area operator, it is the purpose of this chapter to define those areas of responsibility and affirmative acts for which ski area operators shall be liable for loss, damage, or injury and those risks which the skier expressly assumes and for which there can be no recovery.

    Duties of skiers.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      It is recognized that skiing as a recreational sport is hazardous to skiers, regardless of all feasible safety measures which can be taken. Each skier expressly assumes the risk of and legal responsibility for any injury to person or property which results from participation in the sport of skiing including any injury caused by the following: variations in terrain; surface or subsurface snow or ice conditions; bare spots, rocks, trees, or other forms of forest growth or debris, lift towers and components thereof; pole lines; and snowmaking equipment which are plainly visible or are plainly marked in accordance with the provisions of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t53c53-09s53-09-03" target="_self">53-09-03</a></cite>. Therefore, each skier shall have the sole individual responsibility for knowing the range of that skier’s own ability to negotiate any slope, trail, or aerial passenger tramway, and it is the duty of each skier to ski within the limits of the skier’s own ability, to make reasonable control of speed and course at all times while skiing, to heed all posted warnings, to ski only on a skiing area designated by the ski area operator, and to refrain from acting in a manner which may cause or contribute to the injury of anyone. The responsibility for collisions by any skier while actually skiing, with any person or object, is solely that of the individual or individuals involved in such collision and not that of the ski area operator. No person may:

       The attorney general’s office may arrange a short-term line of credit with the Bank of North Dakota should lottery funds on hand be insufficient to meet an immediate major prize obligation. The line of credit is limited to the amount of each prize of one hundred thousand dollars or more that relates to prize funds known to be due and forthcoming to the lottery from other government-authorized lotteries through the multistate lottery association. However, the line of credit may not exceed one million dollars in the aggregate.

      There is established within the state treasury the lottery operating fund into which must be deposited all revenue from the sale of tickets, interest received on money in the fund, and all other fees and moneys collected, less a prize on a lottery promotion, prize on a winning ticket paid by a retailer, and a retailer’s commission. Except for moneys in the lottery operating fund appropriated by the legislative assembly for administrative and operating costs of the lottery under section 53-12.1-10, all other money in the fund is continuously appropriated for the purposes specified in this section. During each regular session, the attorney general shall present a report to the appropriations committee of each house of the legislative assembly on the actual and estimated operating revenue and expenditures for the current biennium and projected operating revenue and expenditures for the subsequent biennium authorized by this section. A payment of a prize or expense or transfer of net proceeds by the lottery may be made only against the fund or money collected from a retailer on the sale of a ticket.

If the director receives a notification that the player disputes the setoff amount or claim upon which the setoff is based, the director shall grant a hearing to the player to determine whether the setoff is proper or the claim is valid, unless a review by a court is authorized under section 50-09-14.
