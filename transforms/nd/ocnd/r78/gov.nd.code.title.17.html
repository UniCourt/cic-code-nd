      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislative assembly adopts the low-emission technology initiative with the goal that the agricultural, forestry, natural resources, and working land of the United States should provide energy from low-emission technology and continue to produce safe, abundant, and affordable food, fuel, feed, and fiber. Increasing America’s low-emission technology use will bring new advancements to market and save consumers money, reduce the nation’s dependence on oil from the Middle East, create good new jobs in rural America, clean up the air, reduce urban smog, and address global warming issues. As used in this initiative, low-emission technology includes biofuels, solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, carbon recycling, carbon sequestration, use of waste heat, recycling, hydrogen, coal, oil, natural gas, and energy efficiency initiatives. Investing and acknowledging a commitment to low-emission technology allows the state to use its abundant natural resources for the benefit of current and future generations. This initiative provides North Dakota consumers with affordable, reliable, resilient, and sustainable energy for the benefit of the state’s economy and communities.

No eligible facility may receive state payments that exceed a cumulative total of ten million dollars or for longer than ten years.

The Bank of North Dakota shall administer the fund. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Bank may transfer any unobligated moneys between funds that have been appropriated by the legislative assembly for interest buydown in the biofuel partnership in assisting community expansion fund and the partnership in assisting community expansion fund.

      <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11">
       In a wind easement and a wind energy lease, the easement and lease:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11a">
         Must be delivered to the property owner with a cover page containing the following paragraph with the correct term of years in the blank and in at least sixteen-point type:
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11b">
         May not be executed by the parties until at least ten business days after the first proposed easement or lease has been delivered to the property owner.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11c">
         May not require either party to maintain the confidentiality of any negotiations or the terms of any proposed lease or easement except that the parties may agree to a mutual confidentiality agreement in the final executed lease or easement.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11d">
         Must preserve the right of the property owner to continue conducting business operations as currently conducted for the term of the agreement. When a wind energy facility is being constructed and when it is completed, the property owner must make accommodations to the developer, owner, or operator of the facility for the facility’s business operations to allow the construction and operation of the wind energy facility.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11e">
         May not make the property owner liable for any property tax associated with the wind energy facility or other equipment related to wind energy generation.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11f">
         May not make the property owner liable for any damages caused by the wind energy facility and equipment or the operation of the generating facility and equipment, including liability or damage to the property owner or to third parties.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11g">
         Must obligate the developer, owner, and operator of the wind energy facility to comply with federal, state, and local laws and regulations and may not make the property owner liable in the case of a violation.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11h">
         Must allow the property owner to terminate the agreement if the wind energy facility has not operated for a period of at least three years unless the property owner receives the normal minimum lease payments that would have occurred if the wind energy facility had been operating during that time. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term “normal minimum lease payments” means a payment in the lease or easement called a “base amount” or “minimum payment”, or similar language, or if this language is not provided for in the lease or easement, payments at least equal to the periodic payments received by the property owner in the last calendar year that the wind energy facility was in full operation.
        </li>
        <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol11i">
         Must state clearly any circumstances that will allow the developer, owner, and operator of the wind energy facility to withhold payments from the property owner.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol12">
       The owner of the wind energy facility shall carry general liability insurance relating to claims for property damage or bodily injury arising out of the construction or operation of the wind energy facility project site and may include the property owner as an additional insured on the policy.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c17-04s17-04-06ol13">
       If the terms of the wind easement or wind energy lease are not in accordance with this section, the court may reform the easement or lease in accordance with this section, void the easement or lease, or order any relief allowed by law.
      </li>

      Special message to property owners
     </p>
     <p>
      This is an important agreement our lawyers have drafted that will bind you and your land for up to ________ years. We will give you enough time to study and thoroughly understand it. We strongly encourage you to hire a lawyer to explain this agreement to you. You may talk with your neighbors about the wind project and find out if they also received a proposed contract. You and your neighbors may choose to hire the same attorney to review the agreement and negotiate changes on your behalf.

      The legislative assembly finds and declares that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t17c17-05s17-05-01ol11">
       North Dakota has twenty-five billion tons of abundant, recoverable lignite coal reserves, enough to last eight hundred years at today’s thirty million tons of annual production.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c17-05s17-05-01ol12">
       The lignite industry presently generates electricity for more than two million people in the northern great plains region and there is increased regional demand for development of North Dakota’s lignite resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c17-05s17-05-01ol13">
       North Dakota has enormous wind resources, providing additional economic opportunity to broaden and diversify the state’s economy and diversify the region’s energy supply, and that timely development of these resources will stabilize and increase revenues to the state.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c17-05s17-05-01ol14">
       Transmission constraints impede the development of the state’s lignite and wind resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c17-05s17-05-01ol15">
       An essential governmental function and public purpose is to assist with the removal of electric transmission export constraints and to assist with upgrading and expansion of the region’s electrical transmission grid to facilitate the development of the state’s abundant natural resources.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c17-05s17-05-01ol16">
       Developing and exporting our natural resources will promote the public interest by increasing employment, stimulating economic activity, augmenting sources of tax revenue, fostering economic stability, and improving the state’s economy.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c17-05s17-05-01ol17">
       State ownership of electrical transmission facilities may not exceed the extent and duration necessary or useful to promote the public interest.
