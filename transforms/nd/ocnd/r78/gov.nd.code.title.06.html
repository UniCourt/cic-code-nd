       The commissioner or the board commences administrative proceedings to assess civil money penalties by serving a complaint on the respondent stating the factual basis for the commissioner’s or board’s belief that a violation has occurred and the amount of civil penalties that the complaint seeks to impose. The complaint must contain a notice of an opportunity for an administrative hearing conducted under chapter 28-32. The date for the hearing must be set not less than thirty days after the date the complaint is served upon the respondent. If assessment of civil money penalties are proposed based on conditions described in subdivisions c through i of subsection 1, a complaint may not be filed unless the respondent has been provided with prior orders, examination reports, or other written communications, and has willfully refused to take corrective action that the respondent was capable of taking at the time.

If a hearing is held and the board concludes that the record so warrants, the board may enter an order imposing civil money penalties upon the respondent. The assessment order is effective and enforceable immediately upon service or upon a date specified in the order, and remains effective and enforceable until it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the board or a reviewing court.

       In determining the amount of civil penalty imposed, the commissioner or board shall consider whether good faith was exercised, and the gravity of the violation and any previous violations. The commissioner or board may not impose a civil money penalty in excess of one hundred thousand dollars for each occurrence and one thousand dollars per day for each day that the violation continues after service of an order. Any civil money penalties collected under this section must be paid to the department of financial institutions and deposited in the financial institutions regulatory fund.

     <p>
      The commissioner or board may enter an order if the commissioner or board finds that a state bank is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. For the purpose of this section, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized have the same definition as found in title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, part 324, section 403, as amended April 15, 2016. The order may require an undercapitalized state bank to take prompt corrective action as the commissioner or board determines reasonable to bring the bank to an adequately capitalized condition, including the submission and implementation of an acceptable capital restoration plan. A bank may request a hearing before the state banking board within ten days of the order to review the factual basis used to issue the request for prompt corrective action. The decision made by the board during this hearing is final. If a hearing is not requested, the initial decision of the commissioner or board is final. For a significantly or critically undercapitalized state bank, the commissioner or board may issue a temporary cease and desist order appointing a receiver in accordance with chapter 6-07.2.

Nothing herein contained may be construed so as to take away from the courts the power to appoint receivers of such financial institutions and credit unions at any stage of the proceedings and thus to terminate the receivership ordered by the board.

    Semiannual assessments of banks and interstate branches.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every state banking association and banking institution under the jurisdiction and control of the commissioner and the commissioner’s deputy examiners by this title, including the Bank of North Dakota and every branch of an out-of-state state bank, shall pay a semiannual assessment. This assessment is to be determined by the state banking board as necessary to fund that portion of the department’s budget relating to the regulation of state-chartered banks and branches of out-of-state state banks, including the authority to enter cooperative fee sharing agreements and assessment of associated travel costs with other state bank supervisors. Fees for the examination of a trust department must be computed in accordance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t06c6-05s6-05-28" target="_self">6-05-28</a></cite>. The assessment must be paid to the department of financial institutions within thirty days of each June thirtieth and December thirty-first. If any such corporation or institution or branch is delinquent more than twenty days in making such payment, the board may seek other administrative remedies of such delinquent corporation, institution, or branch until payment of the amount due. The commissioner may assess a penalty of one percent of the outstanding assessment fee for each day that the assessment fee is delinquent. All fees and penalties under this section must be deposited with the state treasurer and deposited in the financial institutions regulatory fund.

Upon written request, the commissioner may grant an exemption to this section if the commissioner finds that use of the words “bank”, “banker”, or “banking”, or words of like import, are not reasonably likely to cause confusion or lead the public to believe that the person requesting the exemption is a bank, holding company, trade association, or affiliate authorized under this section or is conducting a business subject to the jurisdiction of the department.

      The capital stock of any banking association organized after June 30, 1987, must be not less than one hundred thousand dollars. In addition to such capital requirements, there must be subscribed and paid in at the time of organization a surplus of not less than fifty thousand dollars. The state banking board may require such additional capital, surplus, and undivided profits as it may determine necessary to properly serve the area and to protect the public interest. All of the capital stock and surplus of every association must be paid in before it is authorized to commence business and evidence of such payment either in actual money or a deposit in a previously approved correspondent bank must be furnished to the commissioner before the certificate of authority may be delivered to it. A banking association shall secure federal deposit insurance corporation insurance of deposits before it is authorized to commence business. Evidence of securing such insurance must be furnished to the commissioner before the certificate of authority may be delivered to the banking association.

For the faithful discharge of its duties and the discharge of its trust, it is entitled to reasonable compensation or an amount as has been or may be agreed upon by the parties and all necessary expenses, with legal interest on those amounts. The trustee may acquire and retain securities of any open-end or closed-end management type investment company or investment trust registered under the Federal Investment Company Act of 1940 [Pub.

The fact that the banking institution, or an affiliate of the banking institution, is providing services to the investment company or trust as investment advisor, sponsor, broker, distributor, custodian, transfer agent, registrar, or otherwise and receiving compensation for the services does not preclude the trustee from investing in the securities of that investment company or trust. The banking institution and trust shall disclose to all current income beneficiaries of the trust the rate, formula, and method of the compensation, and the relationship of ownership. No compensation or commission paid or agreed to be paid to it for the negotiation of a loan or the execution of a trust may be deemed interest within the meaning of the law, nor may any excess thereof over the legal rate be deemed usury.

    Powers as to other real estate.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every state banking association has the power to purchase, hold, and convey other real estate as herein provided, and not otherwise:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t06c6-03s6-03-08ol11">
       Such as is mortgaged to it in good faith by way of security for loans or for debts previously contracted.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c6-03s6-03-08ol12">
       Such as is conveyed to it in good faith in satisfaction of debts previously contracted in the course of its dealings.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c6-03s6-03-08ol13">
       Such as it purchases at sales under judgments, decrees, or mortgages held by the association or purchases to secure debts due to it.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Upon transfer to other real estate owned, a current appraisal must be conducted by an individual who is independent of the transaction. Notwithstanding other sections of this chapter, a bank may apply to the commissioner for authority to exchange its interest in real property acquired in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted for an interest in an entity that would dispose of the real property. If the commissioner’s decision with respect to an application is unfavorable, the applicant bank may appeal the decision to the state banking board by filing a notice of appeal with the commissioner within twenty business days after the commissioner has notified the applicant bank of the decision.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any two or more banking institutions upon making application to the commissioner or the state banking board may consolidate or merge if authorized by the commissioner or board into one banking institution under the charter of either existing banking institution on such terms and conditions as lawfully may be agreed upon by a majority of the board of directors of each banking institution proposing to consolidate or merge subject to rules adopted by the state banking board. Before becoming final, such consolidation or merger must be ratified and confirmed by the vote of the shareholders of each such banking institution owning at least two-thirds of its capital stock outstanding at a meeting to be held on the call of the directors. Notice of such meeting and of the purpose thereof must be given to each shareholder of record by registered or certified mail at least ten days prior to the meeting. The shareholders may unanimously waive such notice and may consent to such meeting and consolidation or merger in writing. The capital stock and surplus of such consolidated banking institution must not be less than that required under this title for the organization of a banking institution of the class of the largest consolidating banking institution. Immediately after the consolidation or merger a full report thereof, including a statement of the assets and liabilities of the consolidated banking institution, must be made to the commissioner by the surviving banking institution. Any banking institution may without approval by any state authority convert into or merge or consolidate with a national banking association as provided by federal law. A national bank proposing to merge into a state-chartered bank shall grant the commissioner discretionary authority to conduct an examination. The commissioner shall set fees for such examination at an hourly rate sufficient to cover all reasonable expenses of the department of financial institutions associated with the examination. Fees must be collected by the commissioner and deposited in the financial institutions regulatory fund.

    Conversion to national bank — Sale of bank — Removal to new location.

     <p>
      An association organized to do business in any city in this state, and which has sold or converted its business to a national bank or to any other banking association which is continued at the same place, may not use its charter to recommence business at another place without first obtaining the consent of the state banking board. When a banking association which has not so converted or sold its business is located at a place where there is not, or can reasonably project that there will not be, sufficient business for the profitable conduct of a bank, such association may apply to the state banking board for authority to remove its business to some other place within the state and to change its name if desired, and upon the approval of such application, by the board and the proper amendment of the articles of incorporation, the board may issue authority for such removal and change. No such association, however, is permitted to remove its business to any city unless it has the full amount of capital stock and surplus required by this title for a new organization in such city. A banking association may apply to the state banking board for authority to move its main office to any location currently being operated by the banking association as a facility or to another location within the same corporate city limits.

      Upon compliance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t06c6-03s6-03-13" target="_self">6-03-13</a></cite>.3, any bank organized under chapter 6-02 and under the supervision of the state banking board, and any national bank doing business in this state, may maintain and operate separate and apart from its banking house facilities, in addition to such service at its main banking house. Any activity incidental to the business of banking may be transacted at a separate facility, including receiving deposits of every kind and nature, cashing checks or orders to pay, issuing exchange, making loans, renting safe deposit boxes, exercising fiduciary powers if authorized by the board, and receiving payments payable at the bank. Whenever any banking institution that has been granted approval to establish and maintain a facility deems it advisable to discontinue the maintenance of the facility, the banking institution may apply to the commissioner or state banking board for cancellation and the commissioner or board may order the cancellation approval within the time the board specifies. The banking institution shall provide notice of the application as required by the board by rule.

      A national bank, federal savings association, or state savings and loan association located in this state which follows the procedure prescribed by federal law to convert into a state bank must be granted a state charter if it meets the provisions of the North Dakota Century Code for the incorporation and chartering of a new state bank. Any requirement that shares must be paid in cash may be satisfied by the exchange of shares of the converted state bank for those of the converting national bank, federal savings association, or state savings and loan association, which may be valued at no more than their fair cash market value. The procedure for incorporation of a state bank may be modified by the board to the extent made necessary by the difference between an ordinary incorporation and a conversion and no public hearing need be held on a conversion application. A national bank, federal savings association, or state savings and loan association proposing to convert into a state-chartered bank shall grant the commissioner discretionary authority to conduct an examination. The commissioner shall set fees for the examination at an hourly rate sufficient to cover all reasonable expenses of the department of financial institutions associated with the examination. Fees must be collected by the commissioner, transferred to the state treasurer, and deposited in the financial institutions regulatory fund.

      The capital stock of each association must be divided into shares of not less than ten dollars each and is deemed personal property and transferable on the books of the association in such manner as may be prescribed by its bylaws or articles of incorporation. A transfer of shares is not valid except between the parties to the transfer until the transfer is entered upon the books of the association and is not valid against the association or any creditor of the association while the registered holder of the shares is indebted to the bank as principal debtor, surety, guarantor, or otherwise. No dividend, interest, or profit may be paid on any stock of the bank or bank holding company as long as any past-due liability of the shareholder continues, but such dividend, interest, or profit must be retained by the association and applied to the discharge of the past-due liability. Every person or corporation becoming a shareholder by any transfer shall succeed, in proportion to the shares acquired by that shareholder, to all rights and liabilities of prior holders of the shares existing by reason of ownership of the shares and no change may be made in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the association by which the rights, remedies, or security of its existing creditors shall be impaired.

     <p>
      Except as otherwise authorized under this title, a bank may not employ its money or other assets as principal, directly or indirectly, in trade or commerce, nor may a bank employ or invest any of its assets or funds in the stock of any corporation, limited liability company, bank, partnership, firm, or association. However, to the extent a bank subject to the laws of the federal government is permitted to do so, a state bank may purchase shares of stocks, or any other type of securities offered by small business investment companies organized and licensed under Public Law No. 85-699, known as the Small Business Investment Company Act of 1958 [72 Stat. 689; 15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], and the Small Business Equity Enhancement Act of 1992 [Pub. L. 102-366; 106 Stat. 1007-1020; 15 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], and any amendments thereto, or chapter 10-30, but in no event may any state bank hold securities of small business investment companies in an amount determined by the state banking board, but in no event more than ten percent of the bank’s capital and surplus. A bank may not invest the bank’s assets or funds in speculative margins of stock, bonds, grain, provisions, produce, or other commodities, except that it is lawful for a bank to make advances for grain or other products in store or in transit to market. A bank may invest in subsidiary organizations, when the activities of such organizations are incidental or complementary to the bank’s activities, with the specific approval of the state banking board for each such subsidiary. The state banking board has the same power to make rules for the subsidiary organizations, and to examine the organizations’ records and affairs, as it has for other financial corporations under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t06c6-01s6-01-04" target="_self">6-01-04</a></cite>. If the state banking board determines that such investments would be detrimental to the interests of a bank’s depositors, the state banking board may direct the bank to divest itself of such subsidiary investments. Any officer, director, or employee of any bank who invests or uses the bank’s funds contrary to this title is guilty of a class A misdemeanor.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any number of persons, not less than nine, at least three of whom must be residents of this state, may associate themselves and form a corporation for the purpose of transacting business as an annuity, safe deposit, and trust company. Its existence shall be perpetual.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the time and place stated, and through any sources of information at its command, the board shall examine and consider all relevant factors, including whether the place where such company is proposed to be located is in need of a further annuity, safe deposit, and trust company, whether the proposed institution is adapted to the filling of such need, and whether the proposed incorporators are possessed of such character, integrity, reputation, and financial standing as shown by a detailed financial statement to be furnished by them, that their connection with the company will be beneficial to the public welfare of the community in which such company is proposed to be established. The board shall hear any reasons advanced by the applicants why they should be permitted to organize the proposed institution and any reasons advanced by any person why such institution should not be permitted to be organized. At the termination of such hearing, the board shall make a brief statement in writing of its conclusions, and if it finds that the proposed institution should not be permitted to organize, it shall state briefly the reasons why. A copy of such conclusions either shall be endorsed upon or attached to the organization certificate, together with the refusal or grant of permission to the proposed incorporators to present the said organization certificate to the secretary of state. A determination in favor of such organization must be joined in by a majority of the members of the board.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any banking association organized under chapter 6-02 may apply to the board for an order authorizing the applicant to exercise fiduciary powers. If the determination of the board is in favor of the applicant, the board shall make its order authorizing the applicant to engage in the business of a trust company upon its showing full compliance with sections 6-05-03, 6-05-04, and 6-05-05 except the capital stock of the banking association shall not be required to be divided in shares of one hundred dollars each as provided by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t06c6-05s6-05-03" target="_self">6-05-03</a></cite>. Sections 6-05-06 and 6-05-07 are not applicable to banking associations granted authority to engage in the business of a trust company by the board. Thereafter, such banking association must be subject to the jurisdiction of the board as to its trust company operations the same as trust companies organized under chapter 6-05.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any corporation organized and authorized to transact the business of fidelity insurance and corporate suretyship prior to July 1, 1983, pursuant to the former sections 6-05-08 and 6-05-19 through 6-05-24 and sections 6-05-30 through 6-05-33 may continue to operate under the provisions of those sections as they existed on June 30, 1983.

      No person, firm, company, copartnership, or corporation, either domestic or foreign, not organized under this chapter nor subject to its provisions, except only national banking corporations, state banks authorized under this chapter, state banks or trust companies authorized to engage in trust activities under the laws of another state, their affiliates, bona fide banking institution trade associations and their affiliates, and the Bank of North Dakota, may make use of or display in connection with its business, in signs, letterheads, advertising, or in any other way, such words as “trust”, “trust company”, or any other word or words of like import, nor may any person or concern do or perform anything in the nature of the business of a trust company until and unless such business is regularly organized and authorized under this chapter. If any firm or corporation organized prior to July 1, 1931, has been granted a charter permitting it to use any word, words, or title contrary to the intent of this section, and by reason of its rights under such charter, the provisions of this section may not be enforced against it during the life of such charter. However, no renewal charter may be granted to such person, firm, or corporation permitting the continuance of the use of such word, words, or title contrary to or in violation of this section. Any person, firm, or corporation which, by reason of an existing charter right under any law or statute in effect prior to July 1, 1931, may be held by the courts not to be affected by this section and which therefore refuses to comply with the provisions of this section, during the period of noncompliance, shall display, prominently and continuously in plain, legible, and clearly discernible lettering on all of its signs, stationery, circulars, and advertising, and in all of its printed or written matter the following words and language: “NOT UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THE STATE BANKING BOARD OR THE COMMISSIONER OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS”, and such language must be displayed thereon as prominently as any other matter therein. Any person, firm, company, copartnership, or corporation, domestic or foreign, violating any provision of this section, shall forfeit to the state one hundred dollars for every day or part thereof during which such violation continues. In an action brought by the commissioner or any aggrieved person, the court may issue an injunction restraining such person, firm, company, copartnership, or corporation from further using such words, terms, or phrases in violation of this section or from further transacting business in such a way or manner as to lead the public to believe that its business is in whole or in part of the nature of a trust company, or that it is under the supervision of the state banking board or the commissioner. Upon written request, the commissioner may grant an exemption to this section if the commissioner finds that use of the words “trust” or “trust company”, or words of like import, are not reasonably likely to cause confusion or lead the public to believe that the person requesting the exemption is a trust company, banking institution trade association, or affiliate authorized under this section or is conducting a business subject to the jurisdiction of the department. In granting an exemption under this section, the commissioner may restrict or condition the exemption and use of the name or word or the activities of an exempt person as the commissioner considers appropriate to protect the public interest.

No part of the capital, deposits, trust funds, or property owned or held by it, in trust or otherwise, may be invested in real estate except as herein authorized, unless the investment is made under and by virtue of a particular contract, or instrument, or order, judgment, or decree of court, which confers a special power or authority so to do, and then only with, or to the extent of, the moneys or funds thereby provided and belonging to such particular trust.

      Any trust company may invest all moneys received by it in authorized securities, and shall be responsible to the owner or beneficiary of a trust for the validity, regularity, quality, value, and genuineness of these investments and securities so made, and for the safekeeping of the securities and evidences thereof. When special directions are given in any order, judgment, decree, will, or other written instrument as to the particular manner or the particular class or kind of securities or property in which any investment must be made, it shall follow such directions, and in such case it is not further responsible by reason of the performance of such trust. In all other cases it may invest funds held in any trust capacity in authorized securities using its best judgment in the selection thereof, and shall be responsible for the validity, regularity, quality, and value thereof at the time made, and for their safekeeping. Whether it be the sole trustee or one of two or more cotrustees, it may invest in fractional parts of, as well as in whole, securities, or may commingle funds for investment. If it invests in fractional parts of securities or commingles funds for investment, all of the fractional parts of such securities, or the whole of the funds so commingled must be owned and held by the trust company in its several trust capacities, and it is liable for the administration thereof in all respects as though separately invested. Funds so commingled for investment must be designated collectively as a common trust fund. It may, in its discretion, retain and continue any investment and security or securities coming into its possession in any fiduciary capacity. The foregoing applies as well whether a corporation trustee is acting alone or with an individual cotrustee.

    Manner of organization of credit unions.

     <p>
      A credit union must be organized in the following manner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t06c6-06s6-06-02ol11">
       The applicants shall execute a certificate of organization, in triplicate, by the terms of which they agree to be bound, stating the name and the location of the proposed credit union, the names and addresses of the subscribers to the certificate and the number of shares subscribed by each, and the par value of the shares of the credit union, which may not exceed fifty dollars each. The commissioner shall prescribe the application form.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c6-06s6-06-02ol12">
       The applicants shall prepare and execute proposed bylaws, in triplicate, for the general governance of the credit union consistent with the provisions of this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c6-06s6-06-02ol13">
       The certificate and the proposed bylaws, both executed in triplicate, must be forwarded to the commissioner.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c6-06s6-06-02ol14">
       The applicants shall apply for, secure, and maintain national credit union administration insurance of accounts.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c6-06s6-06-02ol15">
       The board, within thirty days after the receipt of the certificate and bylaws, shall determine whether they comply and are consistent with this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c6-06s6-06-02ol16">
       The board shall instruct the secretary of state to issue a charter, which must be attached to the certificate of organization and returned, together with the bylaws, to the applicants upon payment of a filing fee of thirty dollars to the secretary of state.
      </li>
      <li id="t06c6-06s6-06-02ol17">
       Evidence of securing national credit union administration insurance must be furnished to the commissioner before the charter may be released to the applicant credit union.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      After the provisions of this section have been complied with, the association becomes a body corporate and is known as a credit union.

     <p>
      The certificate of organization or bylaws of a credit union may be amended by the board of directors or the membership of the credit union as specified in the bylaws. If the bylaws provide for amendments by the board of directors, such amendments require an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the authorized number of members of the board of directors of the credit union at any duly held meeting of the board, if the members of the board have been given prior written notice of said meeting and the notice contains a copy of the proposed amendment or amendments. If the bylaws provide for amendments by the membership of the credit union, such amendments require an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present and voting at a duly called regular or special meeting of the membership, providing the members have been given prior written notice of said meeting and the notice contains a copy or summary of the proposed amendment or amendments. No amendment of the bylaws or of the certificate of organization becomes effective, until approved in writing by the state credit union board. Amendments to the certificate of organization together with a filing fee of twenty dollars must be filed with the secretary of state within thirty days after the amendments have been approved by the state credit union board.

Credit unions shall report to the commissioner when called by the commissioner and at least four times each year. The commissioner shall prescribe the forms for the reports. At the discretion of the commissioner, a call may be complied with by submission of a copy of the call report electronic mail directly to the department of financial institutions or by other electronic means of transmission. The call reports are due within thirty days of the call, or according to the deadlines published on the form NCUA 5300, whichever comes first. The commissioner may call for special reports from any credit union whenever in the commissioner’s judgment it is necessary to obtain complete knowledge of the condition of the credit union. Every credit union that fails to make and transmit any report required in pursuance of this section shall forfeit and pay to the state a penalty of up to five hundred dollars for each day of delinquency, not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars. At the discretion of the commissioner, all or part of this penalty may be waived if the reports are submitted within three days after the due date required by this section.

The assessment must be paid to the state treasurer within thirty days of each June thirtieth and December thirty-first. The state treasurer shall report the payments of fees to the commissioner, and if any credit union is delinquent more than twenty days in making payment, the board may seek other administrative remedies until payment of the amount due. The commissioner may assess a penalty of one percent of the outstanding assessment fee for each day that the penalty is delinquent. All fees and penalties under this section must be paid to the state treasurer and deposited in the financial institutions regulatory fund.

Fees for the visit, inspection, or examination must be charged by the department of financial institutions at an hourly rate to be set by the commissioner, sufficient to cover all reasonable expenses of the department associated with the visit, inspection, or examination provided for by this section. A credit union shall pay this fee within ten days of receiving a billing from the commissioner. Fees must be deposited in the financial institutions regulatory fund.

    Failing institution — Emergency powers — Hearing — Order — Appeal.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the state credit union board determines that a merger or acquisition of any of the credit unions under its supervision is necessary because the institution’s equity is impaired, it is conducting its business in an unsafe, unsound, or unauthorized manner, or it is endangering the interests of shareholders, creditors, or the public, whether or not the institution is insolvent, the state credit union board may, without a hearing, declare an emergency and declare that the institution is a failing institution. Upon such declaration, the state credit union board may authorize the commissioner of financial institutions to immediately take possession of the institution. The board is authorized to do all things necessary to continue service to the affected community, including any merger or acquisition under this chapter or otherwise.
     </p>
     <p>
      An institution which is the subject of such a board declaration may ask for a hearing before the state credit union board within five days after service of the state credit union board’s declaration upon it. The application for a hearing must be granted and the hearing must be held not later than ten days after the application is filed. A complete record of the hearing must be established and maintained. On the basis of the hearing, the board shall enter a final order. The institution may appeal the order to the district court of the county in which the credit union is located within ten days after the order is served upon it. The appeal is governed by chapter 28-32 except that the board has ten days after service of the notice of appeal to certify the record, and the district court shall hear the appeal as expeditiously as possible.

       A credit union may be reclassified into the next subordinate net worth category by the commissioner or the state credit union board if it is determined that the credit union is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has not corrected unsafe or unsound practices of which it was, or should have been, aware. The board or commissioner may order a credit union that is adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized to take prompt corrective action to increase the credit union’s net worth. Additionally, the order may require a credit union that is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan to the commissioner. A credit union may request a hearing before the state credit union board within ten days of the order to review the factual basis used to issue the request for prompt corrective action. The decision made by the board during this hearing is final. If a hearing is not requested, the initial decision of the commissioner or board is final. For a significantly undercapitalized credit union that has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized or a critically undercapitalized credit union, the commissioner or board may take possession of the credit union or appoint a conservator or liquidating agent for the credit union in accordance with chapter 6-07.2.

       The organization meeting of the members of a credit union shall be the first annual meeting. At its annual meeting, its members shall elect a board of directors of not less than five members and a credit committee of not less than three members, unless the bylaws of the credit union provide that the credit union may not have a credit committee. A supervisory committee of not less than three members must be elected at the annual meeting, unless the bylaws of the credit union provide that the supervisory committee members be appointed by the board of directors of the credit union or the bylaws provide that the credit union may not have a supervisory committee. In the event the bylaws do not provide for a supervisory committee, then the duties and powers of a supervisory committee, as described in section 6-06-15, are the responsibility of the board of directors. The directors and committee members if any, shall hold office for such terms, respectively, as provided by the bylaws of the credit union and until their successors qualify. A record of the names and addresses of the officers and members of the board and committees must be filed with the commissioner within ten days after their election or appointment. Notice of any change in membership on the board or committees by appointment to fill an unexpired term or otherwise must be filed with the commissioner within ten days of such change. The notice requirement is satisfied if the national credit union association’s call report profile is updated within the ten-day reporting requirement.

       If the bylaws of the credit union provide for a credit committee, then pursuant to the provisions of the bylaws, the board of directors may appoint or the members may elect a credit committee which consists of an odd number of members of the credit union, but which may not include more than one loan officer. The method used must be set forth in the bylaws.

      <li id="t06c6-06s6-06-11ol13">
       If the credit committee is dispensed with in the bylaws, a credit manager, under the general supervision of the board of directors, may be empowered to approve or disapprove loans subject to the policies and conditions prescribed by the board of directors. The president or other qualified senior management official may serve as the credit manager. If a credit manager is provided in lieu of an elected credit committee, the credit manager may appoint one or more loan officers with the power to approve or disapprove loans, and may establish an internal credit committee comprised of designated credit union staff with the power to approve or disapprove loans, subject to such limitations or conditions as the credit manager and board of directors prescribes.

     <p>
      A credit union may charge such entrance fee as may be provided by its bylaws. Its capital consists of the entrance fees paid in and the payments made to it by the several members on shares therein. The credit union has a lien on the shares and deposits of a member for any sum due to the credit union from that member or for the amount due on any loan endorsed by that member. A credit union that is a member of the North Dakota credit union league may, by resolution adopted with a quorum present at a regular or special meeting of the board of directors of the credit union, annually assess against the share accounts of all members of the credit union an amount equal to the whole or proportionate part of the annual membership fee payable to the North Dakota credit union league.

    Authority to borrow — Limitation — Exception.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A credit union may borrow money from any source, but the total borrowings may not exceed twenty-five percent of the credit union’s assets unless the commissioner authorizes a larger amount. The board or commissioner may suspend or restrict the borrowing powers of a credit union. The limitation on borrowing does not apply to a corporate central credit union which is limited to borrowing up to five times the corporate central credit union’s capital, surplus, and reserve fund. For purposes of this section, capital, surplus, and reserve fund for a corporate central credit union includes statutory or regulatory reserves, reserves established for contingencies or any other purposes, undivided earnings, all sums on deposit by other credit unions which are membership capital share deposits as defined by the bylaws of the corporate central credit union, or any other funds being held by the corporate central credit union for the purpose of maintaining a capital base. A credit union must provide within one week written notification to the commissioner of the amount, terms, and source of all borrowings under this section. Written notification is not required if the borrowings are provided by the corporate central credit union and that information is available to the commissioner through electronic inquiry.

A credit union may determine the rate and amount of a dividend before the end of the dividend period involved. A credit union, upon action of its board of directors, may authorize an interest refund to members of record at the close of business the last day of any dividend period in proportion to the interest paid during that dividend period. A credit union shall not pay a dividend if payment would result in the insolvency of the credit union.

     <p>
      A credit union may go into voluntary liquidation on approval of a majority of its members in writing or by a vote in favor of such liquidation by a majority of the members of the credit union at a regular meeting of the members or at a special meeting called for that purpose. When authorization for liquidation is to be obtained at a meeting of members, notice in writing must be given to each member at least seven days before such meeting and the minutes of the meeting must show the number of members present and the number that voted for and against liquidation. If approval by a majority of all members is not obtained at the meeting of members, authorization for voluntary liquidation may be obtained by having a majority of members sign a statement in substantially the following form:
     </p>
     <p>
      We the undersigned members of the Credit Union, Charter No. , hereby request the dissolution of our credit union.
     </p>
     <p>
      Click to view
     </p>

     </h3>
     <p>
      After closing a state trust company, the commissioner shall place a sign at its main entrance stating that the state trust company has been closed. A correspondent bank of the closed state trust company may not pay an item drawn on the account of the closed state trust company which is presented for payment after the correspondent has received actual notice of closing unless it previously certified the item for payment. As soon as practicable after posting the sign at the state trust company’s main entrance, the commissioner shall file a copy of the notice of the action to close a state trust company in district court in the county where the state trust company’s home office is located. The court in which the notice is filed shall docket it as a case styled, “In re liquidation of
   _________ ”, inserting the name of the state trust company. As soon as this notice is filed, the court has constructive custody of all the state trust company’s assets, and any action initiated which seeks to directly or indirectly affect state trust company assets is considered to be an intervention in the receivership proceeding. Venue for an action instituted to effect, contest, or otherwise intervene in the liquidation of a state trust company is Burleigh County, North Dakota, except on a motion filed and served concurrently with or before the filing of the answer, the court, on a finding of good cause, may transfer the action to the county of the state trust company’s home office.

      The court may not require a bond from the commissioner as receiver. Any reference in this chapter to the receiver is a reference to the commissioner as receiver and any successors in office or an independent receiver appointed at the request of the commissioner. The acts of the receiver are the acts of the state trust company in liquidation and this state and its political subdivisions are not liable and may not be held accountable for any debt or obligation of a state trust company in receivership. The receiver has all the powers of the directors, managers, managing participants, officers, and shareholders or participants of the state trust company as necessary to support an action taken on behalf of the state trust company. A state trust company receivership must be administered continuously for the length of time necessary to complete its purposes, and the period prescribed by other law limiting the time for the administration of receiverships or of corporate affairs generally does not apply.

    Contest of liquidation.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A state trust company, acting through a majority of its directors, managers, or managing participants, may intervene in the action filed by the commissioner to challenge the commissioner’s closing of the state trust company and to enjoin the commissioner or other receiver from liquidating its assets. The intervenors must file the intervention not later than the second business day after the closing of the state trust company, excluding legal holidays. The court may issue an ex parte order restraining the receiver from liquidating state trust company assets pending a hearing on the injunction. The receiver shall comply with the restraining order but may petition the court for permission to liquidate an asset as necessary to prevent its loss or diminution pending the outcome of the injunction. The court shall hear this action as quickly as possible and shall give it priority over other business. The state trust company or receiver may appeal the court’s judgment as in other civil cases, except that the receiver shall retain all state trust company assets pending a final appellate court order even if the commissioner does not prevail in the district court. If the commissioner prevails in the district court, liquidation of the state trust company may proceed unless the district court or appellate court orders otherwise. If liquidation is enjoined or stayed pending appeal, the district court retains jurisdiction to permit liquidation of an asset as necessary to prevent its loss or diminution pending the outcome of the appeal.

      As soon as reasonably practicable after initiation of the receivership proceeding, the receiver shall publish notice, in a newspaper of general circulation in each community where the state trust company’s home office and a branch are located. The notice must state that the state trust company has been closed for liquidation, that creditors and clients must present their claims for payment on or before a specific date, and that all safe deposit boxholders and bailors of property left with the state trust company should remove their property not later than a specified date. The receiver shall select the dates to allow the affairs of the state trust company to be wound up as quickly as feasible while allowing creditors, clients, and owners of property adequate time for presentation of claims, withdrawal of accounts, and redemption of property, but may not select a date before one hundred twenty days after the date of the notice. The receiver may adjust the dates with the approval of the court with or without republication if additional time appears needed for these activities. As soon as reasonably practicable given the state trust company records and the adequacy of staffing, the receiver shall mail to each of the state trust company’s known clients, creditors, safe deposit boxholders, and bailors of property left for the state trust company, at the mailing address shown on the state trust company records, an individual notice containing the information required in this section. The receiver may determine the form and content notices under this section.

      A person who has a claim against the estate of a state trust company in liquidation must file proof of claim pursuant to rules adopted by the state banking board. The priority of disposition of assets from the estate of a state trust company must be in accordance with the order of each class as provided by this section. Every claim in each class must be paid in full, or adequate funds must be retained for that payment, before the members of the next class receive any payment. A subclass may not be established within a class, except for a preference or subordination within a class expressly created by contract or other instrument in the articles of association. Assets must be distributed in the following order of priority: administrative expenses; approved claims of secured trust deposits; approved claims of secured creditors; approved claims by beneficiaries insufficient to satisfy all fiduciary claims to commingled fiduciary funds or missing fiduciary property and approved claims of clients of the state trust company; other approved claims of general creditors not falling within a higher priority under this section; approved claims of a type described above that were not filed within the period prescribed; and claims of capital note or debenture holders or holders of similar obligations and proprietary claims of shareholders, participants, or other owners accorded the terms established by issue, class, or series. After completion of the liquidation, any unclaimed property remaining in the hands of the receiver must be considered abandoned property.

       Upon receipt of the application, the commissioner shall investigate the merits of the application. If the commissioner is satisfied the application is complete and all applicable provisions of law have been complied with, the commissioner shall cause an examination to be made of the applicant institution for the purpose of verifying the payment of all the applicant’s liabilities. If the examination satisfies the commissioner that all of the applicant’s liabilities have been paid, the commissioner shall endorse one copy of the certificate with the commissioner’s statement that the institution is voluntarily liquidating. The return of the endorsed copy of the certificate operates to free the institution from further examination and to authorize the institution, under the original corporate name of the institution, to sue and be sued, to execute conveyances and other instruments, to take, hold, and own property, and to do all such other things as may be necessary to realize upon the institution’s remaining assets for the pro rata benefit of the institution’s stockholders, but not to engage or continue in any new or other business under the institution’s charter or otherwise. The liquidation must proceed as expeditiously as possible, and upon conclusion, the institution shall surrender its charter. In lieu of continuing the liquidation under the original corporate name, the institution may transfer the remaining assets to a trustee agreed upon by the stockholders by a majority vote and upon so doing shall surrender the institution’s charter.

        The arrest on an oral charge of an owner of a place of business which had accepted a check drawn on a bank in which the defendant had no account, was proper since such arrest was made on a charge, based upon reasonable cause, of the commission of a felony by the defendant.

        District court erred in dismissing its criminal complaint against defendant for issuing a check without sufficient funds and in deciding that the subject statute was unconstitutional because mens rea was not a required element of a prescribed crime, the notice requirement minimized, if not eliminated, the danger a person may be prosecuted for innocent conduct, and ensures a person charged with violating the statute acted at least recklessly.

        Defendant who contended that this section was being selectively enforced in Cass County against only those individuals financially unable to satisfy NSF checks they had issued, i.e., indigents, failed to meet the heavy burden of proof necessary to demonstrate the constitutionally impermissible enforcement of a statute where he offered no evidence that this section was being enforced against only those NSF check writers who were unable to pay, because of indigency, as opposed to those who were simply unwilling to pay or unable to pay for reasons other than indigency.

        Plain language of N.D.C.C. § 6-08-16 cannot be read to prohibit a holder of an insufficient fund check from electronically debiting collection fees without a written authorization from the check writer; therefore, the North Dakota Department of Financial Institutions improperly entered a cease and desist order to a collection agency regarding its electronic collection of fees for checks returned for insufficient funds.

        County did not discriminate against defendant in its enforcement of this section where merchant was permitted to send a notice of dishonor, whether or not a check was to be presented to the state’s attorney for prosecution was left to the discretion of the merchant, and the state attorney’s office would prosecute a bad check writer regardless of whether or not a notice of dishonor had been sent or payment had been made. State v. Schmitz, 431 N.W.2d 305, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 224</cite> (N.D. 1988).

       <p>
        Sending a notice of dishonor is permissive and not mandatory and the maker of the check has no right to receive notice of its dishonor. State v. Houn, 299 N.W.2d 563, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 316</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection 4 of this section merely permits, but does not require, a notice of dishonor to be sent, and therefore, it seems clear that defendant was not entitled as a matter of right to receive a notice of dishonor before being criminally charged. State v. Latendresse, 459 N.W.2d 234, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1990).

         Obtaining Money Under False Pretenses.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant pleading guilty to obtaining money under false pretenses by passing checks without sufficient funds was subject to sentence under former N.D.C.C. §§ 12-38-04 and 12-38-07 as this section did not repeal or supersede by implication, either in whole or in part, the penalties applicable to violations of N.D.C.C. § 12-38-07. State v. Ziesemer, 93 N.W.2d 803, 1958 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 108</cite> (N.D. 1958).

         Postdated Check.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Knowing receipt of a postdated check by a payee provided the maker of the check a valid defense to a prosecution under this section. State v. Houn, 299 N.W.2d 563, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 316</cite> (N.D. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence sufficiently negated the existence of postdating defense contained in subsection 3 of this section where payee of check testified that check was not knowingly received as postdated; check was properly dated in usual place and no evidence explained cryptic notation, “10-20-89,” written in different ink on memo line of check. State v. Fasching, 461 N.W.2d 102, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 197</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A payee’s knowing receipt of a postdated check is a defense under this section and the State, therefore, must prove its nonexistence beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Hammond, 498 N.W.2d 126, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant’s guilt or innocence turned on the factual question of whether the payee knowingly received defendant’s postdated check, the trial court wrongly usurped the role of the fact finder when it determined the issue at a pretrial conference. State v. Hammond, 498 N.W.2d 126, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 53</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        Sentencing defendant to imprisonment as authorized for a class B misdemeanor for a violation of this section does not violate article I, section 15 of the state constitution, which prohibits imprisonment for debt, because such imprisonment is not for failure to pay a debt, but for issuing a check without sufficient funds either at the time of issuance or at the time of presentment if the check was presented for payment within one week of the original delivery. State v. McDowell, 312 N.W.2d 301, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 403</cite> (N.D. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 981, 103 S. Ct. 318, 74 L. Ed. 2d 294, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 4199 (U.S. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A culpability element is not required to constitute a violation of this section as the violation thereof is a matter of strict criminal liability; lack of a culpability element does not make this section unconstitutional. State v. McDowell, 312 N.W.2d 301, 1981 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 403</cite> (N.D. 1981), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 981, 103 S. Ct. 318, 74 L. Ed. 2d 294, 1982 U.S. LEXIS 4199 (U.S. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is unconstitutional and invalid in its entirety because, by making payment of a nonsufficient funds check an affirmative defense to a criminal charge, it creates a classification based upon wealth in violation of equal protection under the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution.State v. Fischer, 349 N.W.2d 16, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 302</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section as constituted in 1981, prior to its amendment in 1983, did not create any wealth-based classifications and did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection. State v. Mathisen, 356 N.W.2d 129, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 395</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of the constitutional infirmity of the inseverable 1983 amendments to this section was to render the 1983 version of this section a nullity, to be treated as if never enacted, thereby leaving intact the 1981 version until its valid repeal or amendment. Conviction based on the issuance of five bad checks in September, 1984, was upheld. State v. Clark, 367 N.W.2d 168, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 308</cite> (N.D. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this section was not, on its face, defective, when combined with the practice here involved—after the office of the state’s attorney had sent the notice, over ninety-five percent of the persons charged with a violation of this section were people who had received the notice but who had not paid the check, and it was admitted that in most cases they would not have been prosecuted if they had paid the check—this practice effectively made the crime one for failure to pay, for if the check was paid there was no prosecution, and the section was, therefore, unconstitutional. State v. Ohnstad, 392 N.W.2d 389, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 380</cite> (N.D. 1986).

     <p>
      Any bank holding company owned by a charitable trust that sells, assigns, merges, or transfers the stock of any bank or bank holding company pursuant to this chapter shall communicate to and offer to purchase the stock of any minority stockholder of the bank or bank holding company. The offer must be made to minority stockholders at least sixty days before the date of the sale and must extend thirty days after the sale of the bank or bank holding company. The offer must remain open for at least ninety days or for the same period as that which is offered to minority stockholders of the company’s banks located in other states, whichever period is greater. The offer to purchase minority stock in banks in this state must be based on at least the same criteria, standards, and formula as may be used by the bank holding company in computing an offer to purchase the minority stock of its banks in other states. The resulting offer to purchase must be on the same or better terms as any previous offer made by the bank holding company except for those previous offers made by reason of repurchase options between the bank holding company and the stockholder. Such repurchase options may not be used as a basis for determining the offer to purchase other minority stock.

      The state treasurer and the director of the office of management and budget may, when the balance in the state general fund is insufficient to meet legislative appropriations, borrow from the Bank of North Dakota in an amount that at no time exceeds the total principal amount of fifty million dollars with principal maturity not to extend beyond the biennium in which the borrowing occurs. As a condition precedent to the loan, the state treasurer must request and obtain a statement from the director of the office of management and budget and state tax commissioner certifying that anticipated general fund revenues for the balance of the biennium in which the loan is taken will exceed the principal amount and interest on the loan. The state industrial commission may in turn direct the Bank of North Dakota to make loans to the state general fund at such rates of interest as the industrial commission may prescribe. The state treasurer and the director of the office of management and budget shall establish a repayment plan for the repayment of the principal upon maturity and the interest when due. The office of management and budget shall report to the budget section of the legislative management regarding any loans obtained pursuant to this section.

     </h3>
     <p>
      It is declared to be the policy of the state of North Dakota to foster and promote the provision of adequate capital markets and facilities for borrowing money by political subdivisions or other contracting parties and for the financing of their respective public improvements or projects as those terms are used or defined in this chapter or chapter 40-57. It is in the public interest to encourage political subdivisions or other contracting parties to continue their independent undertakings of public improvements or projects and the financing thereof by making funds available at reduced interest costs, especially during periods of restricted credit or money supply. Current credit and municipal bond market conditions require the exercise of the powers of the state to further and implement such policies by authorizing a state instrumentality to be created to borrow money and to issue its bonds to make funds available at reduced rates and on favorable terms for borrowing by political subdivisions or other contracting parties through the purchase or holding of marketable municipal securities of political subdivisions or other contracting parties in fully marketable form or in another form adequate to secure bonds issued by the state instrumentality and by granting broad powers to accomplish and to carry out the policies of the state.

The public finance authority is constituted as an instrumentality of the state exercising public and governmental functions, and the exercise by the public finance authority of the powers conferred by this chapter must be deemed and held to be an essential governmental function of the state.

       The public finance authority may lend money to political subdivisions or other contracting parties through the purchase or holding of municipal securities which, in the opinion of the attorney general, are properly eligible for purchase or holding by the public finance authority under this chapter or chapter 40-57 and for purposes of the public finance authority’s capital financing program the principal amount of any one issue does not exceed five hundred thousand dollars. However, the public finance authority may lend money to political subdivisions through the purchase of securities issued by the political subdivisions through the capital financing program without regard to the principal amount of the bonds issued, if the industrial commission approves a resolution that authorizes the public finance authority to purchase the securities. The capital financing program authorizing resolution must state that the industrial commission has determined that private bond markets will not be responsive to the needs of the issuing political subdivision concerning the securities or, if it appears that the securities can be sold through private bond markets without the involvement of the public finance authority, the authorizing resolution must state reasons for the public finance authority’s involvement in the bond issue. The public finance authority may hold such municipal securities for any length of time it finds to be necessary. The public finance authority, for the purposes authorized by this chapter or chapter 40-57, may issue its bonds payable solely from the revenues available to the public finance authority which are authorized or pledged for payment of public finance authority obligations, and to otherwise assist political subdivisions or other contracting parties as provided in this chapter or chapter 40-57.

       The public finance authority may transfer money to the Bank of North Dakota for allocations to infrastructure projects and programs. Bonds issued for these purposes are payable in each biennium solely from amounts the legislative assembly may appropriate for debt service for any biennium or from a reserve fund established for the bonds. Neither the obligation of the state to pay the bonds nor the obligation of the issuer to pay debt service will constitute a debt of the state or any agency or political subdivision of the state within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision. The issuance of the bond does not directly or contingently obligate the state to pay the bond payments beyond the appropriation for the current biennium of the state. The issuer has no taxing power. In addition to providing funds for the transfers, the public finance authority may use the bond proceeds to pay the costs of issuance of the bonds, capitalized interest, and establish a reserve fund for the bonds.

Each bond must contain on its face a statement to the effect that the public finance authority is obligated to pay such principal or interest, and redemption premium, if any, and that neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the state is pledged to the payment of the principal of or the interest on such bonds. Specific funds pledged to fulfill the public finance authority’s obligations are obligations of the public finance authority.

Moneys in the reserve fund must be held and applied solely to the payment of the interest on and the principal of bonds and sinking fund payments as the same become due and payable and for the retirement of bonds, including payment of any redemption premium required to be paid when any bonds are redeemed or retired prior to maturity.

The required debt service reserve must be an aggregate amount equal to at least the largest amount of money required by the terms of all contracts between the public finance authority and its bondholders to be raised in the then current or any succeeding calendar year for the payment of interest on and maturing principal of outstanding bonds, and sinking fund payments required by the terms of any contracts to sinking funds established for the payment or redemption of the bonds.

Transfers from the strategic investment and improvements fund may not exceed a total of eighty million dollars. Moneys in the guarantee reserve fund are available to reimburse lenders for guaranteed loans in default. The securities in which the moneys in the reserve fund may be invested must meet the same requirements as those authorized for investment under the state investment board. The income from such investments must be made available for the costs of administering the state guarantee loan program and income in excess of that required to pay the cost of administering the program must be deposited in the reserve fund. The amount of reserves for all guaranteed loans must be determined by a formula that will assure, as determined by the Bank, an adequate amount of reserve.

       Upon request of the commissioner, a financial institution must submit a compliance self-critical analysis audit document to the commissioner, or the commissioner’s designee, as a confidential document under the provisions of section 6-01-07, without waiving the privilege set forth in this chapter to which the financial institution would otherwise be entitled. However, the provisions of section 6-01-07 permitting the commissioner to release confidential documents and make them accessible to federal financial institution regulatory agencies does not apply to the compliance self-critical analysis audit documents voluntarily submitted. To the extent the commissioner has the authority to compel the disclosure of a compliance self-critical analysis audit document under other provisions of applicable law, any report furnished to the commissioner may not be provided to any other person or entity and must be accorded the same confidentiality and other protections as provided above for voluntarily submitted documents. Any use of a compliance self-critical analysis audit document furnished as a result of a request of the commissioner, whether under a claim of authority to compel disclosure or not, is limited to determining whether any disclosed defects in a financial institution’s policies or procedures or inappropriate treatment of customers has been remedied or that an appropriate plan for their remedy is in place. The commissioner may not impose any type of administrative fine or penalty as to any area addressed or matter covered in a compliance self-critical analysis audit document furnished at the commissioner’s request, except when there is clear and convincing evidence that the financial institution failed to undertake reasonable corrective action, eliminate inappropriate treatment of customers, or failed to implement an appropriate plan to rectify any noncompliance with state and federal statutes, rules, and orders.

       If a person seeks from a financial institution communications involving a compliance audit or any compliance self-critical analysis audit document during the course of a pending civil or criminal proceeding, the financial institution may assert the self-critical analysis privilege and provide the information set forth in subsection 6 during the course of those proceedings just as any other privilege is asserted in the courts of this state. If the court is required to make a determination as to the privilege, the court shall follow the procedure and conditions set forth in subsection 5.

       If there is a pending administrative proceeding, or there is no pending civil or criminal proceeding, the commissioner, state’s attorney, or attorney general may serve on a financial institution a written request by certified mail for disclosure of a compliance self-critical analysis audit document. Within thirty days after the commissioner, state’s attorney, or attorney general serves on a financial institution a written request by certified mail for disclosure of a compliance self-critical analysis audit document, the financial institution that prepared or caused the document to be prepared may file with the appropriate court a petition requesting an in camera hearing on whether the compliance self-critical analysis audit document or portions of the document are privileged under this chapter or subject to disclosure. The court has jurisdiction over a petition filed by a financial institution under this subsection requesting an in camera hearing on whether the compliance self-critical analysis document or portions of the document are privileged or subject to disclosure. Failure by the financial institution to file a petition waives the privilege for only the specific request made.

       The court, after an in camera review, may require disclosure of material for which the privilege is asserted if the court determines, based upon its in camera review, that any one of the conditions set forth in subsection 2 of section 6-13-06 is applicable as to a civil or administrative proceeding or that any one of the conditions set forth in subsection 3 of section 6-13-06 is applicable as to a criminal proceeding. Upon making such determination, the court may only compel the disclosure of those portions of a compliance self-critical analysis document relevant to issues in dispute in the underlying proceeding. A compelled disclosure may not be considered to be a public document or be deemed to be a waiver of the privilege for any other civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding. A financial institution unsuccessfully opposing disclosure may apply to the court for an appropriate order protecting the document from further disclosure.

      A financial institution asserting the compliance self-critical analysis privilege set forth in this chapter has the burden of demonstrating the applicability of the privilege. Once a financial institution has established the applicability of the privilege, a party seeking disclosure has the burden of proving that the privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose. The commissioner, state’s attorney, or attorney general seeking disclosure of the privilege has the burden of proving the elements set forth in subdivisions a and c of subsection 3 of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t06c6-13s6-13-06" target="_self">6-13-06</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      The parties may at any time stipulate in proceedings under section 6-13-06 or 6-13-07 to entry of an order directing whether the specific information contained in a compliance self-critical analysis audit document is or is not subject to the privilege provided under this chapter. Any such stipulation may be limited to the instant proceeding and, absent specific language to the contrary, is not applicable to any other proceeding.
