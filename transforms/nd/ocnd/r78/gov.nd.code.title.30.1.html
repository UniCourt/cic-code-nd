       In a guardianship case, a ward's statutory rights were not violated because a district court substantially complied with this statute by accepting a physician's letter as the required physician's report. Even though an appointed expert refused to evaluate the ward, this letter provided a medical evaluation to the court satisfying the statutory requirements, and there was liberal construction of this title.

    Effect of fraud and evasion.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever fraud has been perpetrated in connection with any proceeding or in any statement filed under this title, or if fraud is used to avoid or circumvent the provisions or purposes of this title, any person injured thereby may obtain appropriate relief against the perpetrator of the fraud or restitution from any person, other than a bona fide purchaser, benefiting from the fraud, whether innocent or not. Any proceeding must be commenced within two years after the discovery of the fraud, but no proceeding may be brought against one not a perpetrator of the fraud later than five years after the time of commission of the fraud. This section has no bearing on remedies relating to fraud practiced on a decedent during the decedent’s lifetime which affects the succession of the decedent’s estate.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an overriding provision that provides an exception to the procedures and limitations provided in the Code. The remedy of a party wronged by fraud is intended to be supplementary to other protections provided in the Code and can be maintained outside the process of settlement of the estate. Thus, if a will which is known to be forgery is probated informally, and the forgery is not discovered until after the period for contest has run, the defrauded heirs still could bring a fraud action under this section. Or if a will is fraudulently concealed after the testator’s death and its existence not discovered until after the basic three-year period (section 30.1-12-08) has elapsed, there still may be an action under this section. Similarly, a closing statement normally provides binding protection for the personal representative after six months from filing (section 30.1-21-05). However, if there is fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment in the preparation of the claim, a later suit may be brought under this section against the personal representative for damages; or restitution may be obtained from those distributees who benefit by the fraud. In any case innocent purchasers for value are protected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any action under this section is subject to usual rules of res judicata; thus, if a forged will has been informally probated, an heir discovers the forgery, and then there is a formal proceeding under section 30.1-21-01 of which the heir is given notice, followed by an order of complete settlement of the estate, the heir could not bring a subsequent action under section 30.1-01-03 but would be bound by the litigation in which the issue could have been raised. The usual rules for securing relief for fraud on a court would govern, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       The final limitation in this section is designed to protect innocent distributees after a reasonable period of time. There is no limit (other than the two years from discovery of the fraud) against the wrongdoer. But there ought to be some limit after which innocent persons who have built up expectations in good faith cannot be deprived of the property by a restitution action.
      </p>
      <p>
       The time of “discovery” of a fraud is a fact question to be determined in the individual case. In some situations persons may not actually know that a fraud has been perpetrated but have such strong suspicion and evidence that a court may conclude there has been a discovery of the fraud at that stage. On the other hand there is no duty to exercise reasonable care to discover fraud; the burden should not be on the heirs and devisees to check on the honesty of the other interested persons or the fiduciary.

        Action Outside of Probate.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When the formal processes of admitting a will to probate, appointing a personal representative, or settling an estate are preceded by notice to all interested persons and a full adversarial hearing, the adjudication generally binds notified persons. An independent action for relief from fraud is authorized if it has not already been litigated in a formal testacy proceeding, and a party wronged by fraud may bring a timely action outside of the usual procedures and limitations. Ketterling v. Gonzalez (In re the Estate of Ketterling), 515 N.W.2d 158, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        Applicability.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       District court did not err in determining the ownership of the property at issue because its findings that an estate's failed to meet its burden of proving fraud or mistake were not clearly erroneous where the primary purpose of the estate's action was to reform a deed and determine ownership of property the estate alleged it owned, the statute of limitations was not applicable to the estate's quiet title and reformation claim, the estate's appellate brief did not attack the district court's findings of fact on fraud, and the evidence did not establish whether the son and the father's estate intended to change the personal representative's deed or whether the deed was fraudulently or mistakenly altered.

      </p>
      <p>
       Note that paragraph (6) is made desirable by the fact that Sections 2-104 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-04] and 2-702 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-09.1-02] require that survival by 120 hours must be established by clear and convincing evidence.

       Paragraph (4) is inconsistent with Section 1 of Uniform Absence as Evidence of Death and Absentees’ Property Act (1938).

       This section permits the settlor of a revocable trust to prevent the trustee from registering the trust so long as the power of revocation continues.

      <p>
       “General power,” as used in this section, is intended to refer to the common law concept, rather than to tax or other statutory meanings. A general power, as used herein, is one which enables the power holder to draw absolute ownership to himself.

       <p>
        Because a creditor’s claim for tort damages can be filed in a probate proceeding under this title, the death of a potential defendant before the period of the statute of limitations has run on a tort claim does not make N.D.C.C. § 28-01-16 ineffective, and N.D.C.C. § 28-01-26 does not apply. Ness v. Stirling (In re Estate of Stirling), 537 N.W.2d 554, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 177</cite> (N.D. 1995), overruled in part, Olson v. Estate of Rustad, 2013 ND 83, 831 N.W.2d 369, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 85</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court reversed a grant of summary judgment in favor of a corporation in its action for specific performance to compel the estate to sell the decedent’s stock certificates because the action was a claim against the estate under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(7) as it was a claim that sought to impose a liability on the estate based on a contract right to purchase shares, and it was barred by the limitation clause in N.D.C.C. § 30.1-19-03(2)(b).
   Steen &amp; Berg Co. v. Berg (In re Estate of Berg), 2006 ND 86, 713 N.W.2d 87, 2006 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 91</cite> (N.D. 2006).

        In determining whether the adopted woman was a proper devisee of the estate of decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father who predeceased the decedent, courts pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 1-02-03 had to give terms that defined the relationship between people their peculiar and appropriate meaning as defined by statute. Since the decedent’s child under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(4) was the biological son and the adopted woman was the biological father’s “issue” under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(22), the fact of the adopted woman’s adoption by the adoptive father did not affect the relationship between the adopted woman and biological father, according to N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-09(1), and meant that the adopted woman was a proper devisee of decedent.

        Where petitioner was attempting to establish ownership of property through an unprobated will as evidence of a devise, and did not claim that he, or anyone else, was an heir entitled to the minerals under the law of intestate succession, and also did not attempt to probate a will, the proceeding was not a “formal testacy proceeding” as defined by this section or N.D.C.C. 30.1-15-01, and since N.D.C.C. 30.1-15-06 applies to a “formal testacy proceeding”, it did not directly apply here.

       <p>
        Informal proceedings for determining testacy and appointing personal representatives generally do not have notice requirements, are basically ex parte in nature, and are handled administratively, not adversarially. Ketterling v. Gonzalez (In re the Estate of Ketterling), 515 N.W.2d 158, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1994).

        Decedent’s daughter, as the personal representative of her mother’s estate and as a residuary beneficiary and child of the decedent who stood to acquire the disputed property if her action was successful, qualified as an “interested person” under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(25) with standing to bring the will contest. Therefore, the daughter had standing in a will contest proceeding and was not prohibited from relying on the alleged invalidity of her mother and second husband’s marriage as evidence of fraud.
   Black v. Richmond (In re Estate of Richmond), 2005 ND 145, 701 N.W.2d 897, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decedent’s child was an interested person and was able to petition for removal of a personal representative; moreover, a district court failed to follow the statutory requirements for hearings on the petition because it entered an order denying such without providing time to schedule a hearing. The child requested a hearing following the procedural requirements for doing so. Valer v. Bartelson (In re Estate of Bartelson), 2013 ND 129, 833 N.W.2d 522, 2013 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 132</cite> (N.D. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Son could not require a personal representative's supplementary inventory because, once another child was held entitled to an entire estate, the son had no right in or claim against the estate, so the son was no longer an “interested person,” and the son showed no statutory ground for the relief sought. Estate of Pedro v. Scheeler, 2014 ND 237, 856 N.W.2d 775, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 218</cite> (N.D. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dispute over the sale of farmland, a dismissal of an appeal was not warranted based on mootness because the sale was made to an interested person involved in the probate proceedings; therefore, a conveyance after a district court issued its order did not deprive the North Dakota Supreme Court of jurisdiction over the farmland. In re Estate of Johnson, 2015 ND 110, 863 N.W.2d 215, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a personal representative could be an interested person, petitioner was not precluded from filing petitions as an interested person in the formal supervised probate administration while simultaneously performing her fiduciary duty as the personal representative to distribute the property according to the decedent’s will and the best interests of the estate. Bouchard v. Biel (In re Estate of Brandt), 2019 ND 87, 924 N.W.2d 762, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probate court had personal jurisdiction over the parties because all of the parties necessary for determination of the title to the decedent’s property interests that were transferred to the legacy trust fell within the definition of an interested person, and they were provided with notice of the hearing on the petitions; and all parties to the civil action were served with notice of hearing of the petitions to determine title and value to the property. Bouchard v. Biel (In re Estate of Brandt), 2019 ND 87, 924 N.W.2d 762, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 86</cite> (N.D. 2019).

       Where a person of lawful age personally appeared without being cited at a hearing called by a county judge on petition for a guardian’s appointment, and stated that she wished to have a person appointed as her guardian, and signed a written request for his appointment, the court acquired jurisdiction over her person to the same extent as if she had been cited.

        Under certain circumstances, it is appropriate to seek a summary judgment in probate appeals to the district court. Knudsen v. Knudsen, 322 N.W.2d 454 (N.D. 1982), decided prior to the amendment to this section by Session Laws 1973, ch. 352.

       <p>
        County court has jurisdiction to review allegations of breach of fiduciary duty by the personal representative and excessive compensation of persons employed by a personal representative. In re Estate of Ridl, 455 N.W.2d 188, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The county court has jurisdiction to order a person who has received excessive compensation to make a refund to the estate and to order the personal representative to pay for losses to the estate caused by a breach of a fiduciary duty. In re Estate of Ridl, 455 N.W.2d 188, 1990 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 95</cite> (N.D. 1990).

         Conservatorships.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the district court does not have jurisdiction over conservatorships, it is proper for it to stay its order pending a resolution of whether the conservator has the power to revoke the trust in county court. In re Bo, 365 N.W.2d 847, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 286</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        County court had authority to resolve the issue of whether conservator acted with a substantial conflict of interest in authorizing sale of farmland belonging to the estate to her son so as to determine if rescission of the contract was necessary.

        The decision in In re Estate of Jones, 288 N.W.2d 758, which was rendered prior to the 1983 amendment of this section, is no longer dispositive of the issues of equitable jurisdiction of the county courts.

   N.D.C.C. § 28-27-02, N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b)’s separate requirements must also be met, if applicable. Those requirements applied in the personal representative’s case because the personal representative was appealing from a ruling in an informal probate case that did not distribute all of the insurance proceeds, approve a final distribution, or discharge the personal representative, and, thus, because not all of the issues had been ruled upon and no N.D. R. Civ. P. 54(b) certification had been obtained, the state supreme court lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.

        Probate court had personal jurisdiction over the parties because all of the parties necessary for determination of the title to the decedent’s property interests that were transferred to the legacy trust fell within the definition of an interested person, and they were provided with notice of the hearing on the petitions; and all parties to the civil action were served with notice of hearing of the petitions to determine title and value to the property.

       A general power, as used here and in section 30.1-01-05, is one which enables the power holder to draw absolute ownership to himself. The section assumes a valid general power. If the validity of the power itself were in issue, the power holder could not represent others, as for example, the takers in default.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general rules of civil procedure are applicable where not replaced by specific provision, see section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-02s30.1-02-04" target="_self">30.1-02-04</a></cite>.

       </b>
       By technical amendment effective July 31, 1997, (E) under subsection 2(ii) [adopted as last clause of subsection (2)(b)] was added to clarify that orders binding the holder of a general testamentary power may bind others to the extent their interests are subject to the power. The addition, like the other lettered segments of subsection (2)(ii) [subsection (2)(b)], is qualified by the stem language: “To the extent there is no conflict between them or among persons represented…” Also, (iii) under (2) [subsection (2)(c))] was broadened to include minors and incapacitated persons with the others listed as persons who may be bound by judicial orders under principles of virtual representation.

      Editorial Board Prefatory Note for Article II.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Uniform Probate Code was originally promulgated in 1969.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      1990 Revisions
     </b>
     . In 1990, Article II underwent significant revision. The 1990 revisions were the culmination of a systematic study of the Code conducted by the Joint Editorial Board for the Uniform Probate Code (now named the Joint Editorial Board for Uniform Trust and Estate Acts) and a special Drafting Committee to Revise Article II. The 1990 revisions concentrated on Article II, which is the article that covers the substantive law of intestate succession; spouse’s elective share; omitted spouse and children; probate exemptions and allowances; execution and revocation of wills; will contracts; rules of construction; disclaimers; and the effect of homicide and divorce on succession rights; and the rule against perpetuities and honorary trusts.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Themes of the 1990 Revisions.
     </i>
     In the twenty or so years between the original promulgation of the Code and 1990, several developments occurred that prompted the systematic round of review. Three themes were sounded: (1) the decline of formalism in favor of intent-serving policies; (2) the recognition that will substitutes and other inter-vivos transfers have so proliferated that they now constitute a major, if not the major, form of wealth transmission; (3) the advent of the multiple-marriage society, resulting in a significant fraction of the population being married more than once and having stepchildren and children by previous marriages and (4) the acceptance of a partnership or marital-sharing theory of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     The 1990 revisions responded to these themes. The multiple-marriage society and the partnership/marital-sharing theory were reflected in the revised elective-share provisions of Part 2. As the General Comment to Part 2 explained, the revised elective share granted the surviving spouse a right of election that implemented the partnership/marital-sharing theory of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     The children-of-previous-marriages and stepchildren phenomena were reflected most prominently in the revised rules on the spouse’s share in intestacy.
    </p>
    <p>
     The proliferation of will substitutes and other inter-vivos transfers was recognized, mainly, in measures tending to bring the law of probate and nonprobate transfers into greater unison. One aspect of this tendency was reflected in the restructuring of the rules of construction. Rules of construction are rules that supply presumptive meaning to dispositive and similar provisions of governing instruments. See
   Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 11.3 (2003). Part 6 of the pre-1990 Code contained several rules of construction that applied only to wills. Some of those rules of construction appropriately applied only to wills; provisions relating to lapse, testamentary exercise of a power of appointment, and ademption of a devise by satisfaction exemplify such rules of construction. Other rules of construction, however, properly apply to all governing instruments, not just wills; the provision relating to inclusion of adopted persons in class gift language exemplifies this type of rule of construction. The 1990 revisions divided pre-1990 Part 6 into two parts — Part 6, containing rules of construction for wills only; and Part 7, containing rules of construction for wills and other governing instruments. A few new rules of construction were also added.
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to separating the rules of construction into two parts, and adding new rules of construction, the revocation-upon-divorce provision (section 2-804 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-04]) was substantially revised so that divorce not only revokes testamentary devises, but also nonprobate beneficiary designations, in favor of the former spouse. Another feature of the 1990 revisions was a new section (section 2-503 [not adopted by North Dakota]) that brought the execution formalities for wills more into line with those for nonprobate transfers.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      2008 Revisions.
     </b>
     In 2008, another round of revisions was adopted. The principal features of the 2008 revisions are summarized as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Inflation Adjustments.
     </i>
     Between 1990 and 2008, the Consumer Price Index rose by somewhat more than 50 percent. The 2008 revisions raised the dollar amounts by 50 percent in Article II Sections 2-102 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-02], 2-102A,
   2-201 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02], 2-402 [not adopted by North Dakota], 2- 403 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-07-01], and 2-405 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-07-03], and added a new cost of living adjustment section — Section 1-109 [not adopted by North Dakota].
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Intestacy
     </i>
     . Part 1 on intestacy was divided into two subparts: Subpart 1 on general rules of intestacy and subpart 2 on parent-child relationships. For details, see the General Comment to Part 1.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Execution of Wills.
     </i>
     Section 2-502 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-02] was amended to allow notarized wills as an alternative to wills that are attested by two witnesses. That amendment necessitated minor revisions to Section 2-504 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-04] on self-proved wills and to Section 3-406 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-15-06] on the effect of notarized wills in contested cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Class Gifts
     </i>
     . Section 2-705 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-05] on class gifts was revised in a variety of ways, as explained in the revised Comment to that section.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Reformation and Modification
     </i>
     . New Sections 2-805 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-05] and 2-806 [ N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-06] brought the reformation and modification sections now contained in the Uniform Trust Code into the Uniform Probate Code.

     <b>
      General Editorial Board Comment.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The pre-1990 Code’s basic pattern of intestate succession, contained in Part 1, was designed to provide suitable rules for the person of modest means who relies on the estate plan provided by law. The 1990 and 2008 revisions were intended to further that purpose, by fine tuning the various sections and bringing them into line with developing public policy and family relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      1990 Revisions
     </b>
     . The principal features of the 1990 revisions were:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-04ol11">
      So-called negative wills were authorized, under which the decedent who dies intestate, in whole or in part, can by will disinherit a particular heir.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-04ol12">
      A surviving spouse was granted the whole of the intestate estate, if the decedent left no surviving descendants and no parents or if the decedent’s surviving descendants are also descendants of the surviving spouse and the surviving spouse has no descendants who are not descendants of the decedent. The surviving spouse receives the first $200,000 plus three-fourths of the balance if the decedent left no surviving descendants but a surviving parent. The surviving spouse receives the first $150,000 plus one-half of the balance of the intestate estate, if the decedent’s surviving descendants are also descendants of the surviving spouse but the surviving spouse has one or more other descendants. The surviving spouse receives the first $100,000 plus one-half of the balance of the intestate estate, if the decedent has one or more surviving descendants who are not descendants of the surviving spouse. (To adjust for inflation, these dollar figures and other dollar figures in Article II were increased by fifty percent in 2008.)
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-04ol13">
      A system of representation called per capita at each generation was adopted as a means of more faithfully carrying out the underlying premise of the pre-1990 UPC system of representation. Under the per-capita-at-each-generation system, all grandchildren (whose parent has predeceased the intestate) receive equal shares.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-04ol14">
      Although only a modest revision of the section dealing with the status of adopted children and children born of unmarried parents was then made, the question was under continuing review and it was anticipated that further revisions would be forthcoming in the future.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-04ol15">
      The section on advancements was revised so that it applies to partially intestate estates as well as to wholly intestate estates.

      2008 Revisions
     </b>
     . As noted in Item 4 above, it was recognized in 1990 that further revisions on matters of status were needed. The 2008 revisions fulfilled that need. Specifically, the 2008 revisions contained the following principal features:

    <p>
     <i>
      Part 1 Divided into Two Subparts.

    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Subpart 2: Parent-Child Relationships.
     </i>
     New Subpart 2 contains several new or substantially revised sections. New Section 2-115 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-14] contains definitions of terms that are used in subpart 2. New Section 2-116 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-15] is an umbrella section declaring that, except as otherwise provided in Section 2-119(b) through (e) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-18(2)-(5)], if a parent-child relationship exists or is established under this subpart 2, the parent is a parent of the child and the child is a child of the parent for purposes of intestate succession. Section 2-117 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-16] continues the rule that, except as otherwise provided in Sections 2-120 and 2-121 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-19 and 20], a parent-child relationship exists between a child and the child’s genetic parents, regardless of their marital status. Regarding adopted children, Section 2-118 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-17] continues the rule that adoption establishes a parent-child relationship between the adoptive parents and the adoptee for purposes of intestacy. Section 2-119 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-18] addresses the extent to which an adoption severs the parent-child relationship with the adoptee’s genetic parents. New Sections 2-120 and 2-121 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-19 and 20] turn to various parent-child relationships resulting from assisted reproductive technologies in forming families. As one researcher reported: “Roughly 10 to 15 percent of all adults experience some form of infertility.” Debora L. Spar, The Baby Business 31 (2006). Infertility, coupled with the desire of unmarried individuals to have children, have led to increased questions concerning children of assisted reproduction. Sections 2-120 and 2-121 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-19 and 20] address inheritance rights in cases of children of assisted reproduction, whether the birth mother is the one who parents the child or is a gestational carrier who bears the child for an intended parent or intended parents. As two authors have noted: “Parents, whether they are in a married or unmarried union with another, whether they are a single parent, whether they procreate by sexual intercourse or by assisted reproductive technology, are entitled to the respect the law gives to family choice.” Charles P. Kindregan, Jr. &amp; Maureen McBrien, Assisted Reproductive Technology: A Lawyer’s Guide to Emerging Law and Science 6-7 (2006). The final section, new Section 2-122 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-21], provides that nothing contained in Subpart 2 should be construed as affecting application of the judicial doctrine of equitable adoption.

        Purpose of Revision.
       </b>
       The amendments to subsection (a) [subsection (1)] are stylistic, not substantive.
      </p>
      <p>
       New subsection (b) [subsection (2)] authorizes the decedent, by will, to exclude or limit the right of an individual or class to share in the decedent’s intestate estate, in effect disinheriting that individual or class. By specifically authorizing so-called negative wills, subsection (b) reverses the usually accepted common-law rule, which defeats a testator’s intent for no sufficient reason. See Note, “The Intestate Claims of Heirs Excluded by Will: Should ‘Negative Wills’ Be Enforced?”, 52 U. Chi. L. Rev. 177 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not in an individual case the decedent’s will has excluded or limited the right of an individual or class to take a share of the decedent’s intestate estate is a question of construction. A clear case would be one in which the decedent’s will expressly states that an individual is to receive none of the decedent’s estate. Examples would be testamentary language such as “my brother, Hector, is not to receive any of my property” or “Brother Hector is disinherited.”
      </p>
      <p>
       An individual need not be identified by name to be excluded. Thus, if brother Hector is the decedent’s only brother, Hector could be identified by a term such as “my brother.” A group or class of relatives (such as “my brothers and sisters”) can also be excluded under this provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) establishes the consequence of a disinheritance-the share of the decedent’s intestate estate to which the disinherited individual or class would have succeeded passes as if that individual or class had disclaimed the intestate share. Thus, if the decedent’s will provides that brother Hector is to receive $50.00 and no more, Hector is entitled to the $50.00 devise (because Hector is not treated as having predeceased the decedent for purposes of testate succession), but the portion of the decedent’s intestate estate to which Hector would have succeeded passes as if Hector had disclaimed his intestate share. The consequence of a disclaimer by Hector of his intestate share is governed by Section 2-1106(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(2)], which provides that Hector’s intestate share passes to Hector’s descendants by representation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example:
       </i>
       G died partially intestate. G is survived by brother Hector, Hector’s 3 children (X, Y, and Z), and the child (V) of a deceased sister. G’s will excluded Hector from sharing in G’s intestate estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       V takes half of G’s intestate estate, X, Y, and Z split the other half, i.e. they take 1/6 each. Sections 2-103(3) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-03(3)]; 2-106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-6, repealed], 2-1106(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(2)]. Had Hector not been excluded by G’s will, the share to which Hector would have succeeded would have been 1/2. Under section 2-1106(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(2)], that half, not the whole of G’s intestate estate, is what passes to Hector’s descendants by representation as if Hector had disclaimed the intestate share.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that if brother Hector had actually predeceased G, or was treated as if he predeceased G by reason of not surviving G by 120 hours (see section 2-104 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-04]), then no consequence flows from Hector’s disinheritance: V, X, Y, and Z would each take 1/4 of G’s intestate estate under section 2-103(3) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-03(3)] and 2-106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-06, repealed].

        Plain language of N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-01(2) makes it clear that disinheritance of either an individual or a class must be expressed and cannot be implied.
   West v. Myrvik (In re Estate of Samuelson), 2008 ND 190, 757 N.W.2d 44, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 192</cite> (N.D. 2008).

       <p>
        N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-01(2) makes it clear that if a decedent excludes an individual’s right to inherit, and the individual survives the decedent, the individual’s heirs are not automatically excluded, because the share passes to the excluded individual’s heirs.

        The county court did not err in determining that agreement between decedent and his wife, residents of Washington, providing that all their property would be considered community property, title to which would immediately vest in the survivor on the death of either spouse, had no effect on the disposition of decedent’s North Dakota real property.

        Because the district court, which applied the doctrine of partial invalidity, gave effect to a portion of a decedent’s will to distribute the decedent’s shares in a ranch, it could not be said the will did not effectively dispose of the shares. The laws of intestacy therefore did not apply. Grenz v. Grenz (In re Estate of Grenz), 2020 ND 189, 948 N.W.2d 320, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 190</cite> (N.D. 2020).

        Trial court did not err in holding that the granddaughters of a decedent’s half-sister inherited the intestate estate of the decedent because even though the decedent expressly excluded the half-sister under the will, it could not be inferred that the decedent intended to exclude the granddaughters; the decedent did not expressly exclude the half-sister’s heirs pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-01(2).

        Where a will did not include a residuary clause or residuary devise, property devised to a predeceased beneficiary did not pass by will, rather, pursuant to this section it passed by the law of intestate succession to the issue of the decedent’s parents because decedent had no surviving issue or parents. Jordan v. Anderson, 421 N.W.2d 816, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a devise in a will failed due to the fact that the devisee predeceased the decedent, an estate passed under the laws of intestate succession. A trial court erred by awarding a grandmother a portion of a decedent’s estate because the decedent’s wife was entitled to the entire estate through intestate succession, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-02(1)(a); moreover, the decedent’s will did not expressly disinherit the wife, and the wife did not forfeit her right to receive the entire estate through the laws of intestate succession by not withdrawing her petition for exercise of an elective share since she was allowed to state more than one claim or defense.

        Purpose and Scope of 1990 Revisions.
       </b>
       This section was revised in 1990 to give the surviving spouse a larger share than the pre-1990 UPC. If the decedent leaves no surviving descendants and no surviving parent or if the decedent does leave surviving descendants but neither the decedent nor the surviving spouse has other descendants, the surviving spouse is entitled to all of the decedent’s intestate estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the decedent leaves no surviving descendants but does leave a surviving parent, the decedent’s surviving spouse receives the first $300,000 plus three-fourths of the balance of the intestate estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the decedent leaves surviving descendants and if the surviving spouse (but not the decedent) has other descendants, and thus the decedent’s descendants are unlikely to be the exclusive beneficiaries of the surviving spouse’s estate, the surviving spouse receives the first $225,000 plus one-half of the balance of the intestate estate. The purpose is to assure the decedent’s own descendants of a share in the decedent’s intestate estate when the estate exceeds $225,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the decedent has other descendants, the surviving spouse receives $150,000 plus one-half of the balance. In this type of case, the decedent’s descendants who are not descendants of the surviving spouse are not natural objects of the bounty of the surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that in all the cases where the surviving spouse receives a lump sum plus a fraction of the balance, the lump sums must be understood to be in addition to the probate exemptions and allowances to which the surviving spouse is entitled under Part 4. These can add up to a minimum of $64,500.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the pre-1990 Code, the decedent’s surviving spouse received the entire intestate estate only if there were neither surviving descendants nor parents. If there were surviving descendants, the descendants to one-half of the balance of the estate in excess of $50,000 (for example, $25,000 in a $100,000 estate). If there were no surviving descendants, but there was a surviving parent or parents, the parent or parents took that one-half of the balance in excess of $50,000.

        2008 Cost-of-Living Adjustments.

       As revised in 1990, the dollar amount in paragraph (2) was $200,000, in paragraph (3) was $150,000, and in paragraph (4) was $100,000. To adjust for inflation, these amounts were increased in 2008 to $300,000, $225,000, and $150,000 respectively. The dollar amounts in these paragraphs are subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments under Section 1-109 [not adopted by North Dakota].

       Empirical studies support the increase in the surviving spouse’s intestate share, reflected in the revisions of this section. The studies have shown that testators in smaller estates (which intestate estates overwhelmingly tend to be) tend to devise their entire estates to their surviving spouses, even when the couple has children.

        District court properly rescinded a deed (due to undue influence) and concluded that the subject minerals passed to a father and then his surviving spouse because the children did not argue to the district court that their mother's estate had a cause of action against the father relating to the conveyance of the Idaho home, assuming without deciding that the mother's intestate estate included all property wherever located, the total value of her estate was less than $50,000 and would pass to the father under the versions of the North Dakota and Idaho statutes that were in effect when she died in 1989, the trial court correctly applied the law to the facts of the case.

        Because a devise in a will failed due to the fact that the devisee predeceased the decedent, an estate passed under the laws of intestate succession. A trial court erred by awarding a grandmother a portion of a decedent’s estate because the decedent’s wife was entitled to the entire estate through intestate succession, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-02(1)(a); moreover, the decedent’s will did not expressly disinherit the wife, and the wife did not forfeit her right to receive the entire estate through the laws of intestate succession by not withdrawing her petition for exercise of an elective share since she was allowed to state more than one claim or defense.

      <p>
       This section provides for inheritance by descendants of the decedent, parents and their descendants, and grandparents and collateral relatives descended from grandparents; in line with modern policy, it eliminates more remote relatives tracing through great-grandparents.

        1990 Revisions.
       </b>
       The 1990 revisions were stylistic and clarifying, not substantive. The pre-1990 version of this section contained the phrase “if they are all of the same degree of kinship to the decedent they take equally (etc.).” That language was removed. It was unnecessary and confusing because the system of representation in Section 2-106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-06, repealed] gives equal shares if the decedent’s descendants are all of the same degree of kinship to the decedent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “descendants” replaced the word “issue” in this section and throughout the 1990 revisions of Article II. The term issue is a term of art having a biological connotation. Now that inheritance rights, in certain cases, are extended to adopted children, the term descendants is a more appropriate term.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        2008 Revisions.
       </b>
       In addition to making a few stylistic changes, which were not intended to change meaning, the 2008 revisions divided this section into two subsections. New subsection (b) [adopted as subparagraph (6)] grants inheritance rights to descendants of the intestate’s deceased spouse(s) who are not also descendants of the intestate. The term deceased spouse refers to an individual to whom the intestate was married at the individual’s death.

       This section prevents double inheritance. It has potential application in a case in which a deceased person’s brother or sister marries the spouse of the decedent and adopts a child of the former marriage; if the adopting parent died thereafter leaving the child as a natural and adopted grandchild of its grandparents, this section prevents the child from taking as an heir from the grandparents in both capacities.

       This section avoids multiple administrations and in some instances prevents the property from passing to persons not desired by the decedent. See Halbach &amp; Waggoner, The UPC’s New Survivorship and Antilapse Provisions, 55 Alb. L. Rev. 1091, 1094-1099 (1992). The 120-hour period will not delay the administration of a decedent’s estate because Sections 3-302 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-14-02] and 3-307 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-14-07] prevent informal issuance of letters for a period of five days from death. Subsection (b) [subsection (2)] prevents the survivorship requirement from defeating inheritance by the last eligible relative of the intestate who survives for any period.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of a surviving spouse who survives the 120-hour period, the 120- hour requirement of survivorship does not disqualify the spouse’s intestate share for the federal estate-tax marital deduction. See Int.Rev.Code § 2056(b)(3).

       In 2008, this section was reorganized, revised, and combined with former Section 2-108 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-08]. What was contained in former Section 2-104 now appears as subsections (a)(1) and (b) [subsections (1)(a) and (2)]. What was contained in former Section 2-108 now appears as subsection (a)(2) [subsection (1)(b)]. Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) [subsections (1)(a) and (1)(b)] now distinguish between an individual who was born before the decedent’s death and an individual who was in gestation at the decedent’s death. With respect to an individual who was born before the decedent’s death, it must be established by clear and convincing evidence that the individual survived the decedent by 120 hours. For a comparable provision applicable to wills and other governing instruments, see Section 2-702 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-02]. With respect to an individual who was in gestation at the decedent’s death, it must be established by clear and convincing evidence that the individual lived for 120 hours after birth.

       In 2008, this section replaced former Section 2-114(c), which provided: “(c) Inheritance from or through a child by either natural parent or his [or her] kindred is precluded unless that natural parent has openly treated the child as his [or hers], and has not refused to support the child.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(1) [paragraph (1)] recognizes that a parent whose parental rights have been terminated is no longer legally a parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(2) [paragraph (1)] addresses a situation in which a parent’s parental rights were not actually terminated. Nevertheless, a parent can still be barred from inheriting from or through a child if the child died before reaching [18] years of age and there is clear and convincing evidence that immediately before the child’s death the parental rights of the parent could have been terminated under law of this state other than this [code], but only if those parental rights could have been terminated on the basis of nonsupport, abandonment, abuse, neglect, or other actions or inactions of the parent toward the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes providing the grounds for termination of parental rights include: Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 8-533; Conn. Gen. Stat. § 45a-717; Del. Code Ann. tit. 13 § 1103; Fla. Stat.

       Indenture agreement between prospective adoptive parents and foundling home which permitted the indentured child to enforce provisions of the indenture allowing inheritance by the child from the prospective parents did not create the same relationship created by statutory adoption; therefore, the natural children of the prospective parents had no inheritance rights under the laws of intestate succession to the estate of the indentured child upon his death without lineal descendants.

Since the decedent’s child under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(4) was the biological son and the adopted woman was the biological father’s “issue” under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(22), the fact of the adopted woman’s adoption by the adoptive father did not affect the relationship between the adopted woman and biological father, according to N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-09(1), and meant that the adopted woman was a proper devisee of decedent.

        Action by Child.

      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to its amendment in 1977, this section permitted a child born out of wedlock to bring an action after the alleged father’s death to determine rights of inheritance; the child had to show decedent’s paternity by clear and convincing proof; evidence that decedent had lived with child’s mother both before and after child’s birth, had orally acknowledged child as his and had provided support for her constituted sufficiently “clear and convincing” proof; the child’s right to bring an action was not dependent on whether the mother had taken any action to establish paternity by written acknowledgment or judicial determination.

      <p>
       <b>
        Purpose of the 1990 Revisions.
       </b>
       This section was revised so that an advancement can be taken into account with respect to the intestate portion of a partially intestate estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than these revisions, and a few stylistic and clarifying amendments, the original content of the section is maintained, under which the common law relating to advancements is altered by requiring written evidence of the intent that an inter-vivos gift be an advancement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute is phrased in terms of the donee being an heir “at the decedent’s death.” The donee need not be a prospective heir at the time of the gift. For example, if the intestate, G, made an inter-vivos gift intended to be an advancement to a grandchild at a time when the intestate’s child who is the grandchild’s parent is alive, the grandchild would not then be a prospective heir. Nevertheless, if G’s intent that the gift be an advancement is contained in a written declaration or acknowledgment as provided in subsection (a) [subsection (1)], the gift is regarded as an advancement if G’s child (who is the grandchild’s parent) predeceases G, making the grandchild an heir.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be an advancement, the gift need not be an outright gift; it can be in the form of a will substitute, such as designating the donee as the beneficiary of the intestate’s life-insurance policy or the beneficiary of the remainder interest in a revocable inter-vivos trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most inter-vivos transfers today are intended to be absolute gifts or are carefully integrated into a total estate plan. If the donor intends that any transfer during the donor’s lifetime be deducted from the donee’s share of his estate, the donor may either execute a will so providing or, if he or she intends to die intestate, charge the gift as an advance by a writing within the present section.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section applies to advances to the decedent’s spouse and collaterals (such as nephews and nieces) as well as to descendants.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Computation of Shares—Hotchpot Method.
       </b>
       This section does not specify the method of taking an advancement into account in distributing the decedent’s intestate estate. That process, called the hotchpot method, is provided by the common law. The hotchpot method is illustrated by the following example.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example:
       </i>
       G died intestate, survived by his wife (W) and his three children (A, B, and C) by a prior marriage. G’s probate estate is valued at $190,000. During his lifetime, G had advanced A $50,000 and B $10,000. G memorialized both gifts in a writing declaring his intent that they be advancements.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Solution.
       </b>
       The first step in the hotchpot method is to add the value of the advancements to the value of G’s probate estate. This combined figure is called the hotchpot estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this case, G’s hotchpot estate preliminarily comes to $250,000 ($190,000 + $50,000 + $10,000). W’s intestate share of a $250,000 estate under Section 2-102(4) is $200,000 ($150,000 plus 1/2 of $100,000). The remaining $50,000 is divided equally among A, B, and C, or $16,667 each. This calculation reveals that A has received an advancement greater than the share to which he is entitled; A can retain the $50,000 advancement, but is not entitled to any additional amount. A and A’s $50,000 advancement are therefore disregarded and the process is begun over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once A and A’s $50,000 advancement are disregarded, G’s revised hotchpot estate is $200,000 ($190,000 + $10,000). W’s intestate share is $175,000 ($150,000 plus 1/2 of $50,000). The remaining $25,000 is divided equally between B and C, or $12,500 each. From G’s intestate estate, B receives $2,500 (B already having received $10,000 of his ultimate $12,500 share as an advancement); and C receives $12,500. The final division of G’s probate estate is $175,000 to W, zero to A, $2,500 to B, and $12,500 to C.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Effect if Advancee Predeceases the Decedent; Disclaimer.
       </b>
       If a decedent had made an advancement to a person who predeceased the decedent, the last sentence of Section 2-109 provides that the advancement is not taken into account in computing the intestate share of the recipient’s descendants (unless the decedent’s declaration provides otherwise). The rationale is that there is no guarantee that the recipient’s descendants received the advanced property or its value from the recipient’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       To illustrate the application of the last sentence of Section 2-109, consider this case: During her lifetime, G had advanced $10,000 to her son, A. G died intestate, leaving a probate estate of $50,000. G was survived by her daughter, B, and by A’s child, X. A predeceased G.
      </p>
      <p>
       G’s advancement to A is disregarded. G’s $50,000 intestate estate is divided into two equal shares, half ($25,000) going to B and the other half ($25,000) going to A’s child, X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, suppose that A survived G. In this situation, of course, the advancement to A is taken into account in the division of G’s intestate estate. Under the hotchpot method, illustrated above, G’s hotchpot estate is $60,000 (probate estate of $50,000 plus advancement to A of $10,000). A takes half of this $60,000 amount, or $30,000, but is charged with already having received $10,000 of it. Consequently, A takes only a Cr share ($20,000) of G’s intestate estate, and B takes the remaining 3/5 share ($30,000).
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that A cannot use a disclaimer under Section 2-1105 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-02] in effect to give his child, X, a larger share than A was entitled to. Under Section 2-1106(b)(3)(A) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(4)], the effect of a disclaimer by A is that the disclaimant’s “interest” devolves to A’s descendants as if the disclaimant had predeceased the decedent. The “interest” that A renounced was a right to a Cr share of G’s estate, not a 1/2 share. Consequently, A’s Cr share ($20,000) passes to A’s child, X.
      </p>

        2002 Amendment Relating to Disclaimers.
       </b>
       In 2002, the Code’s former disclaimer provision (§ 2-801) was replaced by the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act, which is incorporated into the Code as Part 11 of Article 2 (§§ 2-1101 to 2-1117) [N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-10.1]. The statutory references in this Comment to former Section 2-801 have been replaced by appropriate references to Part 11. Updating these statutory references has not changed the substance of this Comment.

       The purpose of this section is to eliminate the ancient rule that an alien cannot acquire or transmit land by descent, a rule based on the feudal notions of the obligations of the tenant to the King. Although there never was a corresponding rule as to personalty, the present section is phrased in light of the basic premise of the Code that distinctions between real and personal property should be abolished.

       The provisions of this Code replace the common law concepts of dower and curtesy and their statutory counterparts. Those estates provided both a share in intestacy and a protection against disinheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
       In states which have previously abolished dower and curtesy, or where those estates have never existed, the above section should be omitted.

        Scope.
       </b>
       This section sets forth definitions that apply for purposes of the intestacy rules contained in Subpart 2 (Parent-Child Relationship) [N.D.C.C. §§
   30.1-04-14–30.1-04-21].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Definition of “Adoptee”.
       </b>
       The term “adoptee” is not limited to an individual who is adopted as a minor but includes an individual who is adopted as an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Definition of “Assisted Reproduction”.
       </b>
       The definition of “assisted reproduction” is copied from the Uniform Parentage Act § 102. Current methods of assisted reproduction include intrauterine insemination (previously and sometimes currently called artificial insemination), donation of eggs, donation of embryos, in-vitro fertilization and transfer of embryos, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Definition of “Functioned as a Parent of the Child”.
       </b>
       The term “functioned as a parent of the child” is derived from the Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers. The Reporter’s Note No. 4 to § 14.5 of the Restatement lists the following parental functions:
      </p>
      <p>
       Custodial responsibility refers to physical custodianship and supervision of a child. It usually includes, but does not necessarily require, residential or overnight responsibility.Decisionmaking responsibility refers to authority for making significant life decisions on behalf of the child, including decisions about the child’s education, spiritual guidance, and health care.Caretaking functions are tasks that involve interaction with the child or that direct, arrange, and supervise the interaction and care provided by others. Caretaking functions include but are not limited to all of the following:(a) satisfying the nutritional needs of the child, managing the child’s bedtime and wake-up routines, caring for the child when sick or injured, being attentive to the child’s personal hygiene needs including washing, grooming, and dressing, playing with the child and arranging for recreation, protecting the child’s physical safety, and providing transportation;(b) directing the child’s various developmental needs, including the acquisition of motor and language skills, toilet training, self-confidence, and maturation;(c) providing discipline, giving instruction in manners, assigning and supervising chores, and performing other tasks that attend to the child’s needs for behavioral control and self-restraint;(d) arranging for the child’s education, including remedial or special services appropriate to the child’s needs and interests, communicating with teachers and counselors, and supervising homework;(e) helping the child to develop and maintain appropriate interpersonal relationships with peers, siblings, and other family members;(f) arranging for health-care providers, medical follow-up, and home health care;(g) providing moral and ethical guidance;(h) arranging alternative care by a family member, babysitter, or other child-care provider or facility, including investigation of alternatives, communication with providers, and supervision of care.Parenting functions are tasks that serve the needs of the child or the child’s residential family. Parenting functions include caretaking functions, as defined [above], and all of the following additional functions:(a) providing economic support;(b) participating in decisionmaking regarding the child’s welfare;(c) maintaining or improving the family residence, including yard work, and house cleaning;(d) doing and arranging for financial planning and organization, car repair and maintenance, food and clothing purchases, laundry and dry cleaning, and other tasks supporting the consumption and savings needs of the household;(e) performing any other functions that are customarily performed by a parent or guardian and that are important to a child’s welfare and development.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideally, a parent would perform all of the above functions throughout the child’s minority. In cases falling short of the ideal, the trier of fact must balance both time and conduct. The question is, did the individual perform sufficient parenting functions over a sufficient period of time to justify concluding that the individual functioned as a parent of the child. Clearly, insubstantial conduct, such as an occasional gift or social contact, would be insufficient. Moreover, merely obeying a child support order would not, by itself, satisfy the requirement. Involuntarily providing support is inconsistent with functioning as a parent of the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       The context in which the question arises is also relevant. If the question is whether the individual claiming to have functioned as a parent of the child inherits from the child, the court might require more substantial conduct over a more substantial period of time than if the question is whether a child inherits from an individual whom the child claims functioned as his or her parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Definition of “Genetic Father”.
       </b>
       The term “genetic father” means the man whose sperm fertilized the egg of a child’s genetic mother. If the father-child relationship is established under the presumption of paternity recognized by the law of this state, the term means only the man for whom that relationship is established. As stated in the Legislative Note, a state that has enacted the Uniform Parentage Act (2000, as amended) should insert a reference to Section 201(b)(1), (2), or (3) of that Act [North Dakota has done so].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Definition of “Relative”.
       </b>
       The term “relative” does not include any relative no matter how remote but is limited to a grandparent or a descendant of a grandparent, as determined under this subpart 2.

       Estate representative’s contention had to be rejected that the adopted woman was prohibited from inheriting from decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father, because the biological father did not act as the adopted woman’s father before the adopted woman turned 18-years-old, as required by
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-09.1-05(3). Although the biological father did not act as a parent towards the adopted woman between the adopted woman’s ages of three and 15-years-old, the biological father and adopted woman reconciled when the adopted woman was 15-years-old, and the trial court’s finding that the biological father then “functioned as a parent of the child” as defined under
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-14(4) was not clearly erroneous under N.D. R. Civ. P. 52(a). Kraft v. Ramos (In re Estate of Boehm), 2012 ND 104, 816 N.W.2d 793, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 2012).

        2008 Revisions.
       </b>
       In 2008, this section and Section 2-119 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-18] replaced former Section 2-114(b), which provided: “(b) An adopted individual is the child of his [or her] adopting parent or parents and not of his [or her] natural parents, but adoption of a child by the spouse of either natural parent has no effect on (i) the relationship between the child and that natural parent or (ii) the right of the child or a descendant of the child to inherit from or through the other natural parent”. The 2008 revisions divided the coverage of former Section 2-114(b) into two sections. Subsection (a) of this section covered that part of former Section 2-114(b) that provided that an adopted individual is the child of his or her adopting parent or parents. Section 2-119(a) and (b)(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-18(1) and (2)(a)] covered that part of former Section 2-114(b) that provided that an adopted individual is not the child of his natural parents, but adoption of a child by the spouse of either natural parent has no effect on the relationship between the child and that natural parent or (ii) the right of the child or a descendant of the child to inherit from or through the other natural parent.
      </p>

       The 2008 revisions also added subsections (b)(2) and (c) [subsections (2)(b) and (3)], which are explained below.

        Subsection (a) [subsection (1)]: Parent-Child Relationship Between Adoptee and Adoptive Parent or Parents.
       </b>
       Subsection (a) states the general rule that adoption creates a parent-child relationship between the adoptee and the adoptee’s adoptive parent or parents.

       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1) [subsection (2)(a)]: Individual in Process of Being Adopted by Married Couple.

       If the spouse who subsequently died had filed a legal proceeding to adopt the individual before the spouse died, the individual is “in the process of being adopted” by the deceased spouse when the spouse died. However, the phrase “in the process of being adopted” is not intended to be limited to that situation, but is intended to grant flexibility to find on a case by case basis that the process commenced earlier.

        Subsection (c) [subsection (3)]: Child of Assisted Reproduction or Gestational Child in Process of Being Adopted.
       </b>
       Subsection (c) [subsection (3)] provides that if, after a parent-child relationship is established between a child of assisted reproduction and a parent under Section 2-120 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19] or between a gestational child and a parent under Section 2-121 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-20], the child is in the process of being adopted by the parent’s spouse when that spouse dies, the child is treated as adopted by the deceased spouse for the purpose of subsection (b)(2) [subsection (2)(a)]. An example would be a situation in which an unmarried mother or father is the parent of a child of assisted reproduction or a gestational child, and subsequently marries an individual who then begins the process of adopting the child but who dies before the adoption becomes final. In such a case, subsection (c) [subsection (3)] provides that the child is treated as adopted by the deceased spouse for the purpose of subsection (b)(2) [subsection (2)(b)]. The phrase “in the process of being adopted” carries the same meaning under subsection (c) [subsection (3)] as it does under subsection (b)(2) [subsection (2)(b)].

        2008 Revisions.
       </b>
       In 2008, this section and Section 2-118 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-17] replaced former Section 2-114(b), which provided: “(b) An adopted individual is the child of his [or her] adopting parent or parents and not of his [or her] natural parents, but adoption of a child by the spouse of either natural parent has no effect on (i) the relationship between the child and that natural parent or (ii) the right of the child or a descendant of the child to inherit from or through the other natural parent”. The 2008 revisions divided the coverage of former Section 2-114(b) into two sections. Section 2-118(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-17(1)] covered that part of former Section 2-114(b) that provided that an adopted individual is the child of his or her adopting parent or parents. Subsections (a) and (b) [subsections (1) and (2)] of this section covered that part of former Section 2-114(b) that provided that an adopted individual is not the child of his natural parents, but adoption of a child by the spouse of either natural parent has no effect on the relationship between the child and that natural parent or (ii) the right of the child or a descendant of the child to inherit from or through the other natural parent.

       Section 2-119 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-18] uses terms that are defined in Section 2-115 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-14].
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Adoptee
       </i>
       is defined in Section 2-115 as an individual who is adopted. The term is not limited to an individual who is adopted as a minor, but includes an individual who is adopted as an adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Genetic parent
       </i>
       is defined in Section 2-115 as the child’s genetic father or genetic mother. Genetic mother is defined as the woman whose egg was fertilized by the sperm of a child’s genetic father. Genetic father is defined as the man whose sperm fertilized the egg of a child’s genetic mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>

       <b>
        Subsection (a) [subsection (1)]: Parent-Child Relationship Between Adoptee and Adoptee’s Genetic Parents.
       </b>
       Subsection (a) states the general rule that a parent-child relationship does not exist between an adopted child and the child’s genetic parents. This rule recognizes that an adoption severs the parent-child relationship between the adopted child and the child’s genetic parents. The adoption gives the adopted child a replacement family, sometimes referred to in the case law as “a fresh start”. For further elaboration of this theory, see Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 2.5(2)(A) &amp; cmts. d &amp; e (1999). Subsection (a) also states, however, that there are exceptions to this general rule in subsections (b) through (d) [subsections (2)–(4)].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b) [subsection (2)]: Stepchild Adopted by Stepparent.
       </b>
       Subsection (b) continues the so-called “stepparent exception” contained in the Code since its original promulgation in 1969. When a stepparent adopts his or her stepchild, Section 2-118 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-17] provides that the adoption creates a parent-child relationship between the child and his or her adoptive stepparent. Section 2-119(b)(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-18(2)(a)] provides that a parent-child relationship continues to exist between the child and the child’s genetic parent whose spouse adopted the child. Section 2-119(b)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-18(2)(b)] provides that a parent-child relationship also continues to exist between an adopted stepchild and his or her other genetic parent (the noncustodial genetic parent) for purposes of inheritance from and through that genetic parent, but not for purposes of inheritance by the other genetic parent and his or her relatives from or through the adopted stepchild.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 1—Post-Widowhood Remarriage.
       </i>
       A and B were married and had two children, X and Y. A died, and B married C. C adopted X and Y. Under subsection (b)(1) [subsection (2)(a)], X and Y are treated as B’s children and under Section 2-118(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-17(1)] as C’s children for all purposes of inheritance. Under subsection (b)(2) [subsection (2)(b)], X and Y are treated as A’s children for purposes of inheritance from and through A but not for purposes of inheritance from or through X or Y. Thus, if A’s father, G, died intestate, survived by X and Y and by G’s daughter (A’s sister), S, G’s heirs would be S, X, and Y. S would take half and X and Y would take one-fourth each.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 2—Post-Divorce Remarriage.
       </i>
       A and B were married and had two children, X and Y. A and B got divorced, and B married C. C adopted X and Y. Under subsection (b)(1) [subsection (2)(a)], X and Y are treated as B’s children and under Section 2-118(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-17(1)] as C’s children for all purposes of inheritance. Under subsection (b)(2) [subsection (2)(b)], X and Y are treated as A’s children for purposes of inheritance from and through A. On the other hand, neither A nor any of A’s relatives can inherit from or through X or Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c) [subsection (3)]: Individual Adopted by Relative of a Genetic Parent.
       </b>
       Under subsection (c), a child who is adopted by a maternal or a paternal relative of either genetic parent, or by the spouse or surviving spouse of such a relative, remains a child of both genetic parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 3.
       </i>
       F and M, a married couple with a four-year old child, X, were badly injured in an automobile accident. F subsequently died. M, who was in a vegetative state and on life support, was unable to care for X. Thereafter, M’s sister, A, and A’s husband, B, adopted X. F’s father, PGF, a widower, then died intestate. Under subsection (c), X is treated as PGF’s grandchild (F’s child).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (d) [subsection (4)]: Individual Adopted After Death of Both Genetic Parents.
       </b>
       Usually, a post-death adoption does not remove a child from contact with the genetic families. When someone with ties to the genetic family or families adopts a child after the deaths of the child’s genetic parents, even if the adoptive parent is not a relative of either genetic parent or a spouse or surviving spouse of such a relative, the child continues to be in a parent-child relationship with both genetic parents. Once a child has taken root in a family, an adoption after the death of both genetic parents is likely to be by someone chosen or approved of by the genetic family, such as a person named as guardian of the child in a deceased parent’s will. In such a case, the child does not become estranged from the genetic family. Such an adoption does not “remove” the child from the families of both genetic parents. Such a child continues to be a child of both genetic parents, as well as a child of the adoptive parents.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 4.
       </i>
       F and M, a married couple with a four-year-old child, X, were involved in an automobile accident that killed F and M. Neither M’s parents nor F’s father (F’s mother had died before the accident) nor any other relative was in a position to take custody of X. X was adopted by F and M’s close friends, A and B, a married couple approximately of the same ages as F and M. F’s father, PGF, a widower, then died intestate. Under subsection (d), X is treated as PGF’s grandchild (F’s child). The result would be the same if F’s or M’s will appointed A and B as the guardians of the person of X, and A and B subsequently successfully petitioned to adopt X.

        Subsection (e) [subsection (5)]: Child of Assisted Reproduction or Gestational Child Who Is Subsequently Adopted.
       </b>
       Subsection (e) puts a child of assisted reproduction and a gestational child on the same footing as a genetic child for purposes of this section.

        Data on Children of Assisted Reproduction.
       </b>
       The Center for Disease Control (CDC) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services collects data on children of assisted reproduction (ART). See Center for Disease Control, 2004 Assisted Reproductive Technology Success Rates (Dec. 2006) (2004 CDC Report), available at http://www.cdc.gov/ART/ART2004. The data, however, is of limited use because the definition of ART used in the CDC Report excludes intrauterine (artificial) insemination (2004 CDC Report at 3), which is probably the most common form of assisted reproductive procedures. The CDC estimates that in 2004 ART procedures (excluding intrauterine insemination) accounted for slightly more than one percent of total U.S. births. 2004 CDC Report at 13. According to the Report: “The number of infants born who were conceived using ART increased steadily between 1996 and 2004. In 2004, 49,458 infants were born, which was more than double the 20,840 born in 1996.” 2004 CDC Report at 57. “The average age of women using ART services in 2004 was 36. The largest group of women using ART services were women younger than 35, representing 41% of all ART cycles carried out in 2004. Twenty-one percent of ART cycles were carried out among women aged 35-37, 19% among women aged 38-40, 9% among women aged 41-42, and 9% among women older than 42.” 2004 CDC Report at 15.

        AMA Ethics Policy on Posthumous Conception
       </b>
       . The ethics policies of the American Medical Association concerning artificial insemination by a known donor state that “[i]f semen is frozen and the donor dies before it is used, the frozen semen should not be used or donated for purposes other than those originally intended by the donor. If the donor left no instructions, it is reasonable to allow the remaining partner to use the semen for intrauterine insemination but not to donate it to someone else. However, the donor should be advised of such a policy at the time of donation and be given an opportunity to override it.” Am. Med. Assn.

       <b>
        Subsection (b) [subsection (2)]: Third-Party Donor.
       </b>
       Subsection (b) is consistent with the Uniform Parentage Act § 702 [N.D.C.C. §
   14-20-60]. Under subsection (b), a third-party donor does not have a parent-child relationship with a child of assisted reproduction, despite the donor’s genetic relationship with the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c) [subsection (3)]: Parent-Child Relationship With Birth Mother.
       </b>
       Subsection (c) is in accord with the Uniform Parentage Act § 201 [N.D.C.C. §
   14-20-07] in providing that a parent-child relationship exists between a child of assisted reproduction and the child’s birth mother. The child’s birth mother, defined in subsection (a) [subsection (1)] as the woman (other than a gestational carrier) who gave birth to the child, made the decision to undergo the procedure with intent to become pregnant and give birth to the child. Therefore, in order for a parent-child relationship to exist between her and the child, no proof that she consented to the procedure with intent to be treated as the parent of the child is necessary.
      </p>

       <b>
        Subsection (d) [subsection (4)]: Parent-Child Relationship with Husband Whose Sperm Were Used During His Lifetime By His Wife for Assisted Reproduction.
       </b>
       The principal application of subsection (d) is in the case of the assisted reproduction procedure known as intrauterine insemination husband (IIH), or, in older terminology, artificial insemination husband (AIH). Subsection (d) provides that, except as otherwise provided in subsection (i) [subsection (9)], a parent-child relationship exists between a child of assisted reproduction and the husband of the child’s birth mother if the husband provided the sperm that were used during his lifetime by her for assisted reproduction and the husband is the genetic father of the child. The exception contained in subsection (i) relates to the withdrawal of consent in a record before the placement of eggs, sperm, or embryos. Note that subsection (d) only applies if the husband’s sperm were used during his lifetime by his wife to cause a pregnancy by assisted reproduction. Subsection (d) does not apply to posthumous conception.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e) [subsection (5)]: Birth Certificate: Presumptive Effect.
       </b>
       A birth certificate will name the child’s birth mother as mother of the child. Under subsection (c), a parent-child relationship exists between a child of assisted reproduction and the child’s birth mother. Note that the term “birth mother” is a defined term in subsection (a) as not including a gestational carrier as defined in Section 2-121 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-20].
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) applies to the individual, if any, who is identified on the birth certificate as the child’s other parent. Subsection (e) grants presumptive effect to a birth certificate identifying an individual other than the birth mother as the other parent of a child of assisted reproduction. In the case of unmarried parents, federal law requires that states enact procedures under which “the name of the father shall be included on the record of birth,” but only if the father and mother have signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity or a court or an administrative agency of competent jurisdiction has issued an adjudication of paternity. See 42 U.S.C. § 666(a)(5)(D). This federal statute is included as an appendix to the Uniform Parentage Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The federal statute applies only to unmarried opposite-sex parents. Section 2-120(e)’s [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19(5)] presumption, however, could apply to a same-sex couple if state law permits a woman who is not the birth mother to be listed on the child’s birth certificate as the child’s other parent. Even if state law does not permit that listing, the woman who is not the birth mother could be the child’s parent by adoption of the child (see Section 2-118 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-17]) or under subsection (f) [subsection (6)] as a result of her consent to assisted reproduction by the birth mother “with intent to be treated as the other parent of the child,” or by satisfying the “function as a parent” test in subsection (f)(2) [subsection (6)(b)].
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-120 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19] does not apply to same-sex couples that use a gestational carrier. For same-sex couples using a gestational carrier, the parent-child relationship can be established by adoption (see Section 2-118 and Section 2-121(b) [N.D.C.C. §§
   30.1-04-17 and 30.1-04-20(2)]), or it can be established under subsection 2-121(d) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-20(4)] if the couple enters into a gestational agreement with the gestational carrier under which the couple agrees to be the parents of the child born to the gestational carrier. It is irrelevant whether either intended parent is a genetic parent of the child. See Section 2-121(a)(4) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-20(1)(d)].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f) [subsection (6)]: Parent-Child Relationship with Another.
       </b>
       In order for someone other than the birth mother to have a parent-child relationship with the child, there needs to be proof that the individual consented to assisted reproduction by the birth mother with intent to be treated as the other parent of the child. The other individual’s genetic material might or might not have been used to create the pregnancy. Except as otherwise provided in this section, merely depositing genetic material is not, by itself, sufficient to establish a parent-child relationship with the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Subsection (f)(1) [subsection (6)(a)]:
       </i>
       Signed Record Evidencing Consent, Considering All the Facts and Circumstances, to Assisted Reproduction with Intent to Be Treated as the Other Parent of the Child. Subsection (f)(1) provides that a parent-child relationship exists between a child of assisted reproduction and an individual other than the birth mother who consented to assisted reproduction by the birth mother with intent to be treated as the other parent of the child. Consent to assisted reproduction with intent to be treated as the other parent of the child is established if the individual signed a record, before or after the child’s birth, that considering all the facts and circumstances evidences the individual’s consent. Recognizing consent in a record not only signed before the child’s birth but also at any time after the child’s birth is consistent with the Uniform Parentage Act §§ 703 and 704 [N.D.C.C. §§
   14-20-61 and 62].
      </p>
      <p>
       As noted, the signed record need not explicitly express consent to the procedure with intent to be treated as the other parent of child, but only needs to evidence such consent considering all the facts and circumstances. An example of a signed record that would satisfy this requirement comes from In re Martin B., 841 N.Y.S.2d 207 (Sur. Ct. 2007). In that case, the New York Surrogate’s Court held that a child of posthumous conception was included in a class gift in a case in which the deceased father had signed a form that stated: “In the event of my death I agree that my spouse shall have the sole right to make decisions regarding the disposition of my semen samples. I authorize repro lab to release my specimens to my legal spouse [naming her].” Another form he signed stated: “I, [naming him], hereby certify that I am married or intimately involved with [naming her] and the cryopreserved specimens stored at repro lab will be used for future inseminations of my wife/intimate partner.” Although these forms do not explicitly say that the decedent consented to the procedure with intent to be treated as the other parent of the child, they do evidence such consent in light of all of the facts and circumstances and would therefore satisfy subsection (f)(1).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Subsection (f)(2) [subsection (6)(b)]:
       </i>
       Ideally an individual other than the birth mother who consented to assisted reproduction by the birth mother with intent to be treated as the other parent of the child will have signed a record that satisfies subsection (f)(1). If not, subsection (f)(2) recognizes that actions speak as loud as words. Under subsection (f)(2), consent to assisted reproduction by the birth mother with intent to be treated as the other parent of the child is established if the individual functioned as a parent of the child no later than two years after the child’s birth. Under subsection (f)(2)(B) [subsection (6)(b), 2nd cl.], the same result applies if the evidence establishes that the individual had that intent but death, incapacity, or other circumstances prevented the individual from carrying out that intent. Finally, under subsection (f)(2)(C) [subsection (6)(b), 3rd cl.], the same result applies if it can be established by clear and convincing evidence that the individual intended to be treated as a parent of a posthumously conceived child.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g) [subsection (7)]: Record Signed More than Two Years after the Birth of the Child: Effect.
       </b>
       Subsection (g) is designed to prevent an individual who has never functioned as a parent of the child from signing a record in order to inherit from or through the child or in order to make it possible for a relative of the individual to inherit from or through the child. Thus, subsection (g) provides that, for purposes of subsection (f)(1) [subsection (6)(a)], an individual who signed a record more than two years after the birth of the child, or a relative of that individual, does not inherit from or through the child unless the individual functioned as a parent of the child before the child reached the age of [18].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (h) [subsection (8)]: Presumption: Birth Mother is Married or Surviving Spouse.
       </b>
       Under subsection (h), if the birth mother is married and no divorce proceeding is pending, then in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, her spouse satisfies subsection (f)(2)(A) or (B) [subsection (6)(b), cl. 1 or 2] or if the birth mother is a surviving spouse and at her deceased spouse’s death no divorce proceeding was pending, then in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, her deceased spouse satisfies subsection (f)(2)(B) or (C) [subsection (6)(b), cl. 2 or 3].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (i) [subsection (9)]: Divorce Before Placement of Eggs, Sperm, or Embryos.
       </b>
       Subsection (i) is derived from the Uniform Parentage Act § 706(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   14-20-64(2)].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (j) [subsection (10)]: Withdrawal of Consent Before Placement of Eggs, Sperm, or Embryos.
       </b>
       Subsection (j) is derived from the Uniform Parentage Act § 706(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   14-20-64(1)]. Subsection (j) provides that if, in a record, an individual withdraws consent to assisted reproduction before placement of eggs, sperm, or embryos, a child resulting from the assisted reproduction is not a child of that individual, unless the individual subsequently satisfies the requirements of subsection (f) [subsection (6)].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (k) [subsection (11)]: When Posthumously Conceived Gestational Child Treated as in Gestation.
       </b>
       Subsection (k) provides that if, under this section, an individual is a parent of a gestational child who is conceived after the individual’s death, the child is treated as in gestation at the individual’s death for purposes of Section 2-104(a)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-04(1)(b)] if the child is either (i) in utero no later than 36 months after the individual’s death or (ii) born no later than 45 months after the individual’s death. Note also that Section 3-703 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-18-03] gives the decedent’s personal representative authority to take account of the possibility of posthumous conception in the timing of all or part of the distribution of the estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 36-month period in subsection (k) is designed to allow a surviving spouse or partner a period of grieving, time to make up his or her mind about whether to go forward with assisted reproduction, and a reasonable allowance for unsuccessful attempts to achieve a pregnancy. The 36-month period also coincides with Section 3-1006 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-21-06], under which an heir is allowed to recover property improperly distributed or its value from any distributee during the later of three years after the decedent’s death or one year after distribution. If the assisted-reproduction procedure is performed in a medical facility, the date when the child is in utero will ordinarily be evidenced by medical records. In some cases, however, the procedure is not performed in a medical facility, and so such evidence may be lacking. Providing an alternative of birth within 45 months is designed to provide certainty in such cases. The 45-month period is based on the 36-month period with an additional nine months tacked on to allow for a typical period of pregnancy.

        Subsection (a) [subsection (1)]: Definitions.
       </b>
       Subsection (a) defines the following terms:
       <i>
        Gestational agreement.
       </i>
       The definition of gestational agreement is based on the Comment to Article 8 of the Uniform Parentage Act, which states that the term “gestational carrier” “applies to both a woman who, through assisted reproduction, performs the gestational function without being genetically related to a child, and a woman who is both the gestational and genetic mother. The key is that an agreement has been made that the child is to be raised by the intended parents.” The Comment also points out that “The [practice in which the woman is both the gestational and genetic mother] has elicited disfavor in the ART community, which has concluded that the gestational carrier’s genetic link to the child too often creates additional emotional and psychological problems in enforcing a gestational agreement.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Gestational carrier
       </i>
       is defined as a woman who is not an intended parent and who gives birth to a child under a gestational agreement. The term is not limited to a woman who is the child’s genetic mother.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Gestational child
       </i>
       is defined as a child born to a gestational carrier under a gestational agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Intended parent
       </i>
       is defined as an individual who entered into a gestational agreement providing that the individual will be the parent of a child born to a gestational carrier by means of assisted reproduction. The term is not limited to an individual who has a genetic relationship with the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Other Defined Terms.
       </b>
       In addition to the terms defined in subsection (a), this section uses terms that are defined in Section 2-115 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-14].
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Child of assisted reproduction
       </i>
       is defined in Section 2-115 as a method of causing pregnancy other than sexual intercourse.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Divorce
       </i>
       is defined in Section 2-115 as including an annulment, dissolution, and declaration of invalidity of a marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Functioned as a parent of the child
       </i>
       is defined in Section 2-115 as behaving toward a child in a manner consistent with being the child’s parent and performing functions that are customarily performed by a parent, including fulfilling parental responsibilities toward the child, recognizing or holding out the child as the individual’s child, materially participating in the child’s upbringing, and residing with the child in the same household as a regular member of that household.

        Subsection (c) [subsection (3)]: Gestational Carrier.
       </b>
       Under subsection (c), the only way that a parent-child relationship exists between a gestational child and the child’s gestational carrier is if she is (1) designated as a parent of the child in a court order described in subsection (b) or (2) the child’s genetic mother and a parent-child relationship does not exist under this section with an individual other than the gestational carrier.

        Subsection (d) [subsection (4)]: Parent-Child Relationship With Intended Parent or Parents.
       </b>
       Subsection (d) only applies in the absence of a court order under subsection (b). If there is no such court order, subsection (b) provides that a parent-child relationship exists between a gestational child and an intended parent who functioned as a parent of the child no later than two years after the child’s birth. A parent-child also exists between a gestational child and an intended parent if the intended parent died while the gestational carrier was pregnant, but only if (A) there were two intended parents and the other intended parent functioned as a parent of the child no later than two years after the child’s birth; (B) there were two intended parents, the other intended parent also died while the gestational carrier was pregnant, and a relative of either deceased intended parent or the spouse or surviving spouse of a relative of either deceased intended parent functioned as a parent of the child no later than two years after the child’s birth; or (C) there was no other intended parent and a relative of or the spouse or surviving spouse of a relative of the deceased intended parent functioned as a parent of the child no later than two years after the child’s birth.

       <b>
        Subsection (e) [subsection (5)]: Gestational Agreement After Death or Incapacity.
       </b>
       Subsection (e) only applies in the absence of a court order under subsection (b). If there is no such court order, a parent-child relationship exists between a gestational child and an individual whose sperm or eggs were used after the individual’s death or incapacity to conceive a child under a gestational agreement entered into after the individual’s death or incapacity if the individual intended to be treated as the parent of the child. The individual’s intent may be shown by a record signed by the individual which considering all the facts and circumstances evidences the individual’s intent or by other facts and circumstances establishing the individual’s intent by clear and convincing evidence.

       <b>
        Subsections (f) and (g) [subsections (6) and (7)]: Presumption: Gestational Agreement After Spouse’s Death or Incapacity
       </b>
       . Subsection (f) and (g) are connected. Subsection (f) provides that unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a contrary intent, an individual is deemed to have intended to be treated as the parent of a gestational child for purposes of subsection (e)(2) [subsection (5)(b)] if (1) the individual, before death or incapacity, deposited the sperm or eggs that were used to conceive the child, (2) when the individual deposited the sperm or eggs, the individual was married and no divorce proceeding was pending; and (3) the individual’s spouse or surviving spouse functioned as a parent of the child no later than two years after the child’s birth.

      <p>
       Subsection (g) provides, however, that the presumption under subsection (f) does not apply if there is a court order under subsection (b) or a signed record that satisfies subsection (e)(1) [subsection (5)(a)].

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (h) [subsection (8)]: When Posthumously Conceived Gestational Child is Treated as in Gestation.
       </b>
       Subsection (h) provides that if, under this section, an individual is a parent of a gestational child who is conceived after the individual’s death, the child is treated as in gestation at the individual’s death for purposes of Section 2-104(a)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-04(1)(b)] if the child is either (i) in utero not later than 36 months after the individual’s death or (ii) born not later than 45 months after the individual’s death. Note also that Section 3-703 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-18-03] gives the decedent’s personal representative authority to take account of the possibility of posthumous conception in the timing of the distribution of part or all of the estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 36-month period in subsection (g) is designed to allow a surviving spouse or partner a period of grieving, time to make up his or her mind about whether to go forward with assisted reproduction, and a reasonable allowance for unsuccessful attempts to achieve a pregnancy. The three-year period also coincides with Section 3-1006 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-21-06], under which an heir is allowed to recover property improperly distributed or its value from any distributee during the later of three years after the decedent’s death or one year after distribution. If the assisted-reproduction procedure is performed in a medical facility, the date when the child is in utero will ordinarily be evidenced by medical records. In some cases, however, the procedure is not performed in a medical facility, and so such evidence may be lacking. Providing an alternative of birth within 45 months is designed to provide certainty in such cases. The 45-month period is based on the 36-month period with an additional nine months tacked on to allow for a typical period of pregnancy.

      General Editorial Board Comment.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The elective share of the surviving spouse was fundamentally revised in 1990 and was reorganized and clarified in 1993 and 2008. The main purpose of the revisions is to bring elective-share law into line with the contemporary view of marriage as an economic partnership. The economic partnership theory of marriage is already implemented under the equitable-distribution system applied in both the common-law and community-property states when a marriage ends in divorce. When a marriage ends in death, that theory is also already implemented under the community-property system and under the system promulgated in the Model Marital Property Act. In the common-law states, however, elective-share law has not caught up to the partnership theory of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     The general effect of implementing the partnership theory in elective-share law is to increase the entitlement of a surviving spouse in a long-term marriage in cases in which the marital assets were disproportionately titled in the decedent’s name; and to decrease or even eliminate the entitlement of a surviving spouse in a long-term marriage in cases in which the marital assets were more or less equally titled or disproportionately titled in the surviving spouse’s name. A further general effect is to decrease or even eliminate the entitlement of a surviving spouse in a short-term, later-in-life marriage (typically a post-widowhood remarriage) in which neither spouse contributed much, if anything, to the acquisition of the other’s wealth, except that a special supplemental elective-share amount is provided in cases in which the surviving spouse would otherwise be left without sufficient funds for support.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      The Partnership Theory of Marriage.
     </b>
     The partnership theory of marriage, sometimes also called the marital-sharing theory, is stated in various ways. Sometimes it is thought of “as an expression of the presumed intent of husbands and wives to pool their fortunes on an equal basis, share and share alike.” M. Glendon, The Transformation of Family Law (1989). Under this approach, the economic rights of each spouse are seen as deriving from an unspoken marital bargain under which the partners agree that each is to enjoy a half interest in the fruits of the marriage, i.e., in the property nominally acquired by and titled in the sole name of either partner during the marriage (other than in property acquired by gift or inheritance). A decedent who disinherits his or her surviving spouse is seen as having reneged on the bargain. Sometimes the theory is expressed in restitutionary terms, a return-of-contribution notion. Under this approach, the law grants each spouse an entitlement to compensation for non-monetary contributions to the marital enterprise, as “a recognition of the activity of one spouse in the home and to compensate not only for this activity but for opportunities lost.” Id. See also American Law Institute, Principles of Family Dissolution § 4.09 Comment c (2002).
    </p>
    <p>
     No matter how the rationale is expressed, the community-property system, including that version of community law promulgated in the Model Marital Property Act, recognizes the partnership theory, but it is sometimes thought that the common-law system denies it. In the ongoing marriage, it is true that the basic principle in the common-law (title-based) states is that marital status does not affect the ownership of property. The regime is one of separate property. Each spouse owns all that he or she earns. By contrast, in the community-property states, each spouse acquires an ownership interest in half the property the other earns during the marriage. By granting each spouse upon acquisition an immediate half interest in the earnings of the other, the community-property regimes directly recognize that the couple’s enterprise is in essence collaborative.
    </p>
    <p>
     The common-law states, however, also give effect or purport to give effect to the partnership theory when a marriage is dissolved by divorce. If the marriage ends in divorce, a spouse who sacrificed his or her financial-earning opportunities to contribute so-called domestic services to the marital enterprise (such as child rearing and homemaking) stands to be recompensed. All states now follow the equitable-distribution system upon divorce, under which “broad discretion [is given to] trial courts to assign to either spouse property acquired during the marriage, irrespective of title, taking into account the circumstances of the particular case and recognizing the value of the contributions of a nonworking spouse or homemaker to the acquisition of that property. Simply stated, the system of equitable distribution views marriage as essentially a shared enterprise or joint undertaking in the nature of a partnership to which both spouses contribute–directly and indirectly, financially and nonfinancially–the fruits of which are distributable at divorce.” J. Gregory, The Law of Equitable Distribution ¶
   1.03, at p. 1-6 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     The other situation in which spousal property rights figure prominently is disinheritance at death. The original (pre-1990) Uniform Probate Code, along with almost all other non-UPC common-law states, treats this as one of the few instances in American law where the decedent’s testamentary freedom with respect to his or her title-based ownership interests must be curtailed. No matter what the decedent’s intent, the original Uniform Probate Code and almost all of the non-UPC common-law states recognize that the surviving spouse does have some claim to a portion of the decedent’s estate. These statutes provide the spouse a so-called forced share. The forced share is expressed as an option that the survivor can elect or let lapse during the administration of the decedent’s estate, hence in the UPC the forced share is termed the “elective” share.
    </p>
    <p>
     Elective-share law in the common-law states, however, has not caught up to the partnership theory of marriage. Under typical American elective-share law, including the elective share provided by the original Uniform Probate Code, a surviving spouse may claim a one-third share of the decedent’s estate—not the 50 percent share of the couple’s combined assets that the partnership theory would imply.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Long-term Marriages.
     </i>
     To illustrate the discrepancy between the partnership theory and conventional elective-share law, consider first a long-term marriage, in which the couple’s combined assets were accumulated mostly during the course of the marriage. The original elective-share fraction of one-third of the decedent’s estate plainly does not implement a partnership principle. The actual result depends on which spouse happens to die first and on how the property accumulated during the marriage was nominally titled.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Example 1—Long-term Marriage under Conventional Forced-share Law.
     </i>
     Consider A and B, who were married in their twenties or early thirties; they never divorced, and A died at age, say, 70, survived by B. For whatever reason, A left a will entirely disinheriting B.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throughout their long life together, the couple managed to accumulate assets worth $600,000, marking them as a somewhat affluent but hardly wealthy couple.
    </p>
    <p>
     Under conventional elective-share law, B’s ultimate entitlement depends on the manner in which these $600,000 in assets were nominally titled as between them. B could end up much poorer or much richer than a 50/50 partnership principle would suggest. The reason is that under conventional elective-share law, B has a claim to one-third of A’s “estate.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Marital Assets Disproportionately Titled in Decedent’s Name; Conventional Elective-share Law Frequently Entitles Survivor to Less Than Equal Share of Marital Assets.
     </i>
     If all the marital assets were titled in A’s name, B’s claim against A’s estate would only be for $200,000—well below B’s $300,000 entitlement produced by the partnership/marital-sharing principle.
    </p>
    <p>
     If $500,000 of the marital assets were titled in A’s name, B’s claim against A’s estate would still only be for $166,500 (1/3 of $500,000), which when combined with B’s “own” $100,000 yields a $266,500 cut for B—still below the $300,000 figure produced by the partnership/marital-sharing principle.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Marital Assets Equally Titled; Conventional Elective-share Law Entitles Survivor to Disproportionately Large Share.
     </i>
     If $300,000 of the marital assets were titled in A’s name, B would still have a claim against A’s estate for $100,000, which when combined with B’s “own” $300,000 yields a $400,000 cut for B—well above the $300,000 amount to which the partnership/marital-sharing principle would lead.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Marital Assets Disproportionately Titled in Survivor’s Name; Conventional Elective-share Law Entitles Survivor to Magnify the Disproportion.
     </i>
     If only $200,000 were titled in A’s name, B would still have a claim against A’s estate for $66,667 (1/3 of $200,000), even though B was already overcompensated as judged by the partnership/marital-sharing theory.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Short-term, Later-in-Life Marriages.
     </i>
     Short-term marriages, particularly the post-widowhood remarriage occurring later in life, present different considerations. Because each spouse in this type of marriage typically comes into the marriage owning assets derived from a former marriage, the one-third fraction of the decedent’s estate far exceeds a 50/50 division of assets acquired during the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Example 2—Short-term, Later-in-Life Marriage under Conventional Elective-share Law.
     </i>
     Consider B and C. A year or so after A’s death, B married C. Both B and C are in their seventies, and after five years of marriage, B dies survived by C. Both B and C have adult children and a few grandchildren by their prior marriages, and each naturally would prefer to leave most or all of his or her property to those children.
    </p>
    <p>
     The value of the couple’s combined assets is $600,000, $300,000 of which is titled in B’s name (the decedent) and $300,000 of which is titled in C’s name (the survivor).
    </p>
    <p>
     For reasons that are not immediately apparent, conventional elective-share law gives the survivor, C, a right to claim one-third of B’s estate, thereby shrinking B’s estate (and hence the share of B’s children by B’s prior marriage to A) by $100,000 (reducing it to $200,000) while supplementing C’s assets (which will likely go to C’s children by C’s prior marriage) by $100,000 (increasing their value to $400,000).
    </p>
    <p>
     Conventional elective-share law, in other words, basically rewards the children of the remarried spouse who manages to outlive the other, arranging for those children a windfall share of one-third of the “loser’s” estate. The “winning” spouse who chanced to survive gains a windfall, for this “winner” is unlikely to have made a contribution, monetary or otherwise, to the “loser’s” wealth remotely worth one-third.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      The redesigned elective share.
     </b>
     The redesigned elective share is intended to bring elective-share law into line with the partnership theory of marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the long-term marriage illustrated in Example 1, the effect of implementing a partnership theory is to increase the entitlement of the surviving spouse when the marital assets were disproportionately titled in the decedent’s name; and to decrease or even eliminate the entitlement of the surviving spouse when the marital assets were more or less equally titled or disproportionately titled in the surviving spouse’s name. Put differently, the effect is both to reward the surviving spouse who sacrificed his or her financial-earning opportunities in order to contribute so-called domestic services to the marital enterprise and to deny an additional windfall to the surviving spouse in whose name the fruits of a long-term marriage were mostly titled.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the short-term, later-in-life marriage illustrated in Example 2, the effect of implementing a partnership theory is to decrease or even eliminate the entitlement of the surviving spouse because in such a marriage neither spouse is likely to have contributed much, if anything, to the acquisition of the other’s wealth. Put differently, the effect is to deny a windfall to the survivor who contributed little to the decedent’s wealth, and ultimately to deny a windfall to the survivor’s children by a prior marriage at the expense of the decedent’s children by a prior marriage. Bear in mind that in such a marriage, which produces no children, a decedent who disinherits or largely disinherits the surviving spouse may not be acting so much from malice or spite toward the surviving spouse, but from a natural instinct to want to leave most or all of his or her property to the children of his or her former, long-term marriage. In hardship cases, however, as explained later, a special supplemental elective-share amount is provided when the surviving spouse would otherwise be left without sufficient funds for support.

      2008 Revisions.
     </i>
     When first promulgated in the early 1990s, the statute provided that the “elective-share percentage” increased annually according to a graduated schedule. The “elective-share percentage” ranged from a low of 0 percent for a marriage of less than one year to a high of 50 percent for a marriage of fifteen years or more. The “elective-share percentage” did double duty. The system equated the “elective-share percentage” of the couple’s combined assets with 50 percent of the marital-property portion of the couple’s assets—the assets that are subject to equalization under the partnership theory of marriage. Consequently, the elective share effected the partnership theory rather indirectly. Although the schedule was designed to represent by approximation a constant fifty percent of the marital-property portion of the couple’s assets (the augmented estate), it did not say so explicitly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The 2008 revisions are designed to present the system in a more direct form, one that makes the system more transparent and therefore more understandable. The 2008 revisions disentangle the elective-share percentage from the system that approximates the marital-property portion of the augmented estate. As revised, the statute provides that the “elective-share percentage” is always 50 percent, but it is not 50 percent of the augmented estate but 50 percent of the “marital-property portion” of the augmented estate [North Dakota did not make this change]. The marital-property portion of the augmented estate is computed by approximation—by applying the percentages set forth in a graduated schedule that increases annually with the length of the marriage (each “marital-portion percentage” being double the percentage previously set forth in the “elective-share percentage” schedule). Thus, for example, under the former system, the elective-share amount in a marriage of ten years was 30 percent of the augmented estate. Under the revised system, the elective-share amount is 50 percent of the marital-property portion of the augmented estate, the marital-property portion of the augmented estate being 60 percent of the augmented estate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The primary benefit of these changes is that the statute, as revised, presents the elective-share’s implementation of the partnership theory of marriage in a direct rather than indirect form, adding clarity and transparency to the system. An important by-product of the revision is that it facilitates the inclusion of an alternative provision for enacting states that want to implement the partnership theory of marriage but prefer not to define the marital-property portion by approximation but by classification. Under the deferred marital-property approach, the marital-property portion consists of the value of the couple’s property that was acquired during the marriage other than by gift or inheritance. (See below.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The 2008 revisions are based on a proposal presented in Waggoner, “The Uniform Probate Code’s Elective Share: Time for a Reassessment,” 37 U. Mich. J. L. Reform 1 (2003), an article that gives a more extensive explanation of the rationale of the 2008 revisions.

      Specific Features of the Redesigned Elective Share.
     </b>
     Because ease of administration and predictability of result are prized features of the probate system, the redesigned elective share implements the marital-partnership theory by means of a mechanically determined approximation system. Under the redesigned elective share, there is no need to identify which of the couple’s property was earned during the marriage and which was acquired prior to the marriage or acquired during the marriage by gift or inheritance. For further discussion of the reasons for choosing this method, see Waggoner, “Spousal Rights in Our Multiple-Marriage Society: The Revised Uniform Probate Code,” 26 Real Prop. Prob. &amp; Tr. J. 683 (1992).

      Section 2-202(a) [N.D.C.C. §
    30.1-05-01(1)]—The “Elective-share Amount.”
     </i>
     Under Section 2-202(a,) the elective-share amount is equal to 50 percent of the value of the “marital-property portion of the augmented estate.” The marital-property portion of the augmented estate, which is determined under Section 2-203(b) [not adopted by North Dakota], increases with the length of the marriage. The longer the marriage, the larger the “marital-property portion of the augmented estate.” The sliding scale adjusts for the correspondingly greater contribution to the acquisition of the couple’s marital property in a marriage of 15 years than in a marriage of 15 days. Specifically, the “marital-property portion of the augmented estate” starts low and increases annually according to a graduated schedule until it reaches 100 percent. After one year of marriage, the marital-property portion of the augmented estate is six percent of the augmented estate and it increases with each additional year of marriage until it reaches the maximum 100 percent level after 15 years of marriage [North Dakota’s provision continues to refer simply to the “augmented estate” and did not add the language “marital-property portion of”].
    </p>

     <i>
      Section 2-203(a) [not adopted by North Dakota]—the “Augmented Estate.”
     </i>
     The elective-share percentage of 50 percent is applied to the value of the “marital-property portion of the augmented estate.” As defined in Section 2-203, the “augmented estate” equals the value of the couple’s combined assets, not merely the value of the assets nominally titled in the decedent’s name.
    </p>
    <p>
     More specifically, the “augmented estate” is composed of the sum of four elements: Section 2-204 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(a)]—the value of the decedent’s net probate estate; Section 2-205 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(b)]—the value of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others, consisting of will-substitute-type inter-vivos transfers made by the decedent to others than the surviving spouse; Section 2-206 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(c)]—the value of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to the surviving spouse, consisting of will-substitute-type inter-vivos transfers made by the decedent to the surviving spouse; and Section 2-207 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(d)]—the value of the surviving spouse’s net assets at the decedent’s death, plus any property that would have been in the surviving spouse’s nonprobate transfers to others under Section 2-205 had the surviving spouse been the decedent.

      Section 2-202(a) [N.D.C.C. §
    30.1-05-01(1)]—the “Elective-share Amount.”
     </i>
     Section 2-202(a) requires the elective-share percentage of 50 percent to be applied to the value of the marital-property portion of the augmented estate [North Dakota did not make the change to include “marital-property portion”]. This calculation yields the “elective-share amount”—the amount to which the surviving spouse is entitled. If the elective-share percentage were to be applied only to the marital-property portion of the decedent’s assets, a surviving spouse who has already been overcompensated in terms of the way the marital-property portion of the couple’s assets have been nominally titled would receive a further windfall under the elective-share system. The marital-property portion of the couple’s assets, in other words, would not be equalized. By applying the elective-share percentage of 50 percent to the marital-property portion of the augmented estate (the couple’s combined assets), the redesigned system denies any significance to how the spouses took title to particular assets.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Section 2-209 [N.D.C.C. §
    30.1-05-03]—Satisfying the Elective-share Amount.
     </i>
     Section 2-209 determines how the elective-share amount is to be satisfied. Under Section 2-209, the decedent’s net probate estate [term “net” is not used in North Dakota’s provision] and nonprobate transfers to others are liable to contribute to the satisfaction of the elective-share amount only to the extent the elective-share amount is not fully satisfied by the sum of the following amounts: Subsection (a)(1) [subsection (1)(a)]—amounts that pass or have passed from the decedent to the surviving spouse by testate or intestate succession and amounts included in the augmented estate under Section 2-206 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(c)], i.e., the value of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to the surviving spouse; and Subsection (a)(2) [subsection (1)(b)] the marital-property portion of amounts included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-01(2)].
    </p>
    <p>
     If the combined value of these amounts equals or exceeds the elective-share amount, the surviving spouse is not entitled to any further amount from recipients of the decedent’s net probate estate or non-probate transfers to others, unless the surviving spouse is entitled to a supplemental elective-share amount under Section 2-202(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-01(2)].
    </p>
    <p>
     In a marriage that has lasted less than 15 years, only a portion of the survivor’s assets—not all—count toward making up the elective-share amount. This is because, in these shorter-term marriages, the marital-property portion of the survivor’s assets under Section 2-203(b) [not adopted by North Dakota] is less than 100% and, under Section 2-209(a)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-03(1)(b)], the portion of the survivor’s assets that count toward making up the elective-share amount is limited to the marital-property portion of those assets.
    </p>
    <p>
     To explain why this is appropriate requires further elaboration of the underlying theory of the redesigned system. The system avoids the classification and tracing-to-source problems in determining the marital-property portion of the couple’s assets. This is accomplished under Section 2-203(b) by applying an ever-increasing percentage, as the length of the marriage increases, to the couple’s combined assets without regard to when or how those assets were acquired. By approximation, the redesigned system equates the marital-property portion of the couple’s combined assets with the couple’s marital assets—assets subject to equalization under the partnership/marital-sharing theory. Thus, in a marriage that has endured long enough for the marital-property portion of their assets to be 60% under Section 2-203(b), 60% of each spouse’s assets are treated as marital assets. Section 2-209(a)(2) therefore counts only 60% of the survivor’s assets toward making up the elective-share amount.

     <b>
      Deferred Marital-Property Alternative.
     </b>
     By making the elective share percentage a flat 50 percent of the marital-property portion of the augmented estate, the 2008 revision disentangles the elective share percentage from the approximation schedule, thus allowing the marital-property portion of the augmented estate to be defined either by the approximation schedule or by the deferred-marital-property approach. Although one of the benefits of the 2008 revision is added clarity, an important by-product of the revision is that it facilitates the inclusion of an alternative provision for enacting states that prefer a deferred marital-property approach. See Alan Newman, Incorporating the Partnership Theory of Marriage into Elective-Share Law: the Approximation System of the Uniform Probate Code and the Deferred-Community-Property Alternative, 49 Emory L.J. 487 (2000).

    <p>
     <b>
      The Support Theory.
     </b>
     The partnership/marital-sharing theory is not the only driving force behind elective-share law. Another theoretical basis for elective-share law is that the spouses’ mutual duties of support during their joint lifetimes should be continued in some form after death in favor of the survivor, as a claim on the decedent’s estate. Current elective-share law implements this theory poorly. The fixed fraction, whether it is the typical one-third or some other fraction, disregards the survivor’s actual need. A one-third share may be inadequate to the surviving spouse’s needs, especially in a modest estate. On the other hand, in a very large estate, it may go far beyond the survivor’s needs. In either a modest or a large estate, the survivor may or may not have ample independent means, and this factor, too, is disregarded in conventional elective-share law. The redesigned elective share system implements the support theory by granting the survivor a supplemental elective-share amount related to the survivor’s actual needs. In implementing a support rationale, the length of the marriage is quite irrelevant. Because the duty of support is founded upon status, it arises at the time of the marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Section 2-202(b) [N.D.C.C. §
    30.1-05-01(2)]—the “Supplemental Elective-share Amount.”
     </i>
     Section 2-202(b) is the provision that implements the support theory by providing a supplemental elective-share amount of $75,000. The $75,000 figure is bracketed to indicate that individual states may wish to select a higher or lower amount.
    </p>
    <p>
     In satisfying this $75,000 amount, the surviving spouse’s own titled-based ownership interests count first toward making up this supplemental amount; included in the survivor’s assets for this purpose are amounts shifting to the survivor at the decedent’s death and amounts owing to the survivor from the decedent’s estate under the accrual-type elective-share apparatus discussed above, but excluded are (1) amounts going to the survivor under the Code’s probate exemptions and allowances and (2) the survivor’s Social Security benefits (and other governmental benefits, such as Medicare insurance coverage). If the survivor’s assets are less than the $75,000 minimum, then the survivor is entitled to whatever additional portion of the decedent’s estate is necessary, up to 100 percent of it, to bring the survivor’s assets up to that minimum level. In the case of a late marriage, in which the survivor is perhaps aged in the mid-seventies, the minimum figure plus the probate exemptions and allowances (which under the Code amount to a minimum of another $64,500) is pretty much on target — in conjunction with Social Security payments and other governmental benefits — to provide the survivor with a fairly adequate means of support.
    </p>

     <b>
      Decedent’s Nonprobate Transfers to Others.
     </b>
     The original Code made great strides toward preventing “fraud on the spouse’s share.” The problem of “fraud on the spouse’s share” arises when the decedent seeks to evade the spouse’s elective share by engaging in various kinds of nominal inter-vivos transfers. To render that type of behavior ineffective, the original Code adopted the augmented-estate concept, which extended the elective-share entitlement to property that was the subject of specified types of inter-vivos transfer, such as revocable inter-vivos trusts.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the redesign of the elective share, the augmented-estate concept has been strengthened. The pre-1990 Code left several loopholes ajar in the augmented estate—a notable one being life insurance the decedent buys, naming someone other than his or her surviving spouse as the beneficiary. With appropriate protection for the insurance company that pays off before receiving notice of an elective-share claim, the redesigned elective-share system includes these types of insurance policies in the augmented estate as part of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others under Section 2-205 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(c)(3)].

       The revision of this section is the first step in the overall plan of implementing a partnership or marital-sharing theory of marriage, with a support theory back-up.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a) [subsection (1)].
       </b>
       Subsection (a) implements the partnership theory by providing that the elective-share amount is 50 percent of the value of the marital-property portion of the augmented estate [North Dakota did not add the language “marital-property portion of”]. The augmented estate is defined in Section 2-203(a) [not adopted by North Dakota] and the marital-property portion of the augmented estate is defined in Section 2-203(b) [not adopted by North Dakota].

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b) [subsection (2)].
       </b>
       Subsection (b) implements the support theory of the elective share by providing a [$75,000] supplemental elective-share amount, in case the surviving spouse’s assets and other entitlements are below this figure.

       As originally promulgated in 1990, the dollar amount in subsection (b) was $50,000. To adjust for inflation, this amount was increased in 2008 to $75,000. The dollar amount in this subsection is subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments under Section 1-109 [not adopted by North Dakota].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c) [subsection (3)].
       </b>
       The homestead, exempt property, and family allowances provided by Article II, Part 4, are not charged to the electing spouse as a part of the elective share. Consequently, these allowances may be distributed from the probate estate without reference to whether an elective share right is asserted.

       <b>
        Cross Reference.
       </b>
       To have the right to an elective share under subsection (a) [subsection (1)], the decedent’s spouse must survive the decedent. Under Section 2-702(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-02], the requirement of survivorship is satisfied only if it can be established that the spouse survived the decedent by 120 hours.

Comp.

        Because a devise in a will failed due to the fact that the devisee predeceased the decedent, an estate passed under the laws of intestate succession. A trial court erred by awarding a grandmother a portion of a decedent’s estate because the decedent’s wife was entitled to the entire estate through intestate succession, pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-02(1)(a); moreover, the decedent’s will did not expressly disinherit the wife, and the wife did not forfeit her right to receive the entire estate through the laws of intestate succession by not withdrawing her petition for exercise of an elective share since she was allowed to state more than one claim or defense.

   30.1-07-01]), and enforceable claims. The term “claims” is defined in Section 1-201 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-06] as including “liabilities of the decedent or protected person whether arising in contract, in tort, or otherwise, and liabilities of the estate which arise at or after the death of the decedent or after the appointment of a conservator, including funeral expenses and expenses of administration. The term does not include estate or inheritance taxes, or demands or disputes regarding title of a decedent or protected person to specific assets alleged to be included in the estate.”

        Comment to 2-205 [N.D.C.C. §
    30.1-05-02(2)(b)].
       </b>
       This section, which in the 1990 version appeared in substance as a paragraph of a single, long section defining the augmented estate, establishes as the second component of the augmented estate the value of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others. In the 1990 version, the term “reclaimable estate” was used rather than the term “nonprobate transfers to others”.
      </p>
      <p>
       This component is divided into three basic categories: (1) property owned or owned in substance by the decedent immediately before death that passed outside probate to persons other than the surviving spouse; (2) property transferred by the decedent during marriage that passed outside probate to persons other than the surviving spouse; and (3) property transferred by the decedent during marriage and during the two-year period next preceding the decedent’s death. Various aspects of each category and each subdivision within each category are discussed and illustrated below.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Paragraph (1)-Property Owned or Owned in Substance by the Decedent.
       </i>
       This category covers property that the decedent owned or owned in substance immediately before death and that passed outside probate at the decedent’s death to a person or persons other than the surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (1) subdivides this category into four specific components:
      </p>
      <p>
       (i) Property over which the decedent alone, immediately before death, held a presently exercisable general power of appointment. The amount included is the value of the property subject to the power, to the extent the property passed at the decedent’s death, by exercise, release, lapse, in default, or otherwise, to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       (ii) The decedent’s fractional interest in property held by the decedent in joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. The amount included is the value of the decedent’s fractional interest, to the extent the fractional interest passed by right of survivorship at the decedent’s death to a surviving joint tenant other than the decedent’s surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       (iii) The decedent’s ownership interest in property or accounts held in POD, TOD, or co-ownership registration with the right of survivorship. The amount included is the value of the decedent’s ownership interest, to the extent the decedent’s ownership interest passed at the decedent’s death to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       (iv) Proceeds of insurance, including accidental death benefits, on the life of the decedent, if the decedent owned the insurance policy immediately before death or if and to the extent the decedent alone and immediately before death held a presently exercisable general power of appointment over the policy or its proceeds. The amount included is the value of the proceeds, to the extent they were payable at the decedent’s death to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       With one exception for nonseverable joint tenancies (see Example 4 of this Section), each of the above components covers a type of asset of which the decedent could have become the full, technical owner by merely exercising his or her power of appointment, incident of ownership, or right of severance or withdrawal. Had the decedent exercised these powers or rights to become the full, technical owner, the decedent could have controlled the devolution of these assets by his or her will; by not exercising these powers or rights, the decedent allowed the assets to pass outside probate to persons other than the surviving spouse. Thus, in effect, property covered by these components passes at the decedent’s death by nonprobate transfer from the decedent to others. This is what justifies including these components in the augmented estate without regard to the person who created the decedent’s substantive ownership interest, whether the decedent or someone else, and without regard to when it was created, whether before or after the decedent’s marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the augmented estate under the pre-1990 Code did not include life insurance, annuities, etc., payable to other persons, the revisions do include their value; this move recognizes that such arrangements were, under the pre-1990 Code, used to deplete the estate and reduce the spouse’s elective-share entitlement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Various aspects of paragraph (1) are illustrated by the following examples. Other examples illustrating various aspects of this paragraph are Example 19 in this Comment, below, and Examples 20 and 21 in the Comment to Section 2-206, below. In each of the following examples, G is the decedent and S is the decedent’s surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 1-General Testamentary Power.
       </i>
       G’s mother, M, created a testamentary trust, providing for the income to go to G for life, remainder in corpus to such persons, including G, G’s creditors, G’s estate, or the creditors of G’s estate, as G by will appoints; in default of appointment, to X. G died, survived by S and X. G’s will did not exercise his power in favor of S.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of the corpus of the trust at G’s death is not included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(i), regardless of whether G exercised the power in favor of someone other than S or let the power lapse, so that the trust corpus passed in default of appointment to X. Section 2-205(1)(i) only applies to presently exercisable general powers; G’s power was a general testamentary power. (Note that paragraph (2)(ii) does cover property subject to a general testamentary power, but only if the power was created by G during marriage. G’s general testamentary power was created by M and hence not covered by paragraph (2)(ii).)
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 2-Nongeneral Power and “5-and-5” Power
       </i>
       . G’s father, F, created a testamentary trust, providing for the income to go to G for life, remainder in corpus to such persons, except G, G’s creditors, G’s estate, or the creditors of G’s estate, as G by will appoints; in default of appointment, to X. G was also given a noncumulative annual power to withdraw an amount equal to the greater of $5,000 or five percent of the trust corpus. G died, survived by S and X. G did not exercise her power in favor of S.
      </p>
      <p>
       G’s power over the remainder interest does not cause inclusion of the value of the full corpus in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(i) because that power was a nongeneral power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of the greater of $5,000 or five percent of the corpus of the trust at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(i), to the extent that that property passed at G’s death, by exercise, release, lapse, in default, or otherwise, to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse, because that portion of the trust corpus was subject to a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by G immediately before G’s death. No additional amount is included, however, whether G exercised the withdrawal power or allowed it to lapse in the years prior to G’s death. (Note that paragraph (3)(i) is inapplicable to this case. That paragraph only applies to property subject to powers created by the decedent during marriage that lapse within the two-year period next preceding the decedent’s death.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 3-Revocable Inter-Vivos Trust.
       </i>
       G created a revocable intervivos trust, providing for the income to go to G for life, remainder in corpus to such persons, except G, G’s creditors, G’s estate, or the creditors of G’s estate, as G by will appoints; in default of appointment, to X. G died, survived by S and X. G never exercised his power to revoke, and the corpus of the trust passed at G’s death to X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of whether G created the trust before or after marrying S, the value of the corpus of the trust at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(i) because, immediately before G’s death, the trust corpus was subject to a presently exercisable general power of appointment (the power to revoke: see Section 2-201(6) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(a)(6)]) held by G.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Note that if G created the trust during marriage, paragraph (2)(ii) also requires inclusion of the value of the trust corpus. Because these two subparagraphs overlap, and because both subparagraphs include the same value, Section 2-208(c) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(5)] provides that the value of the trust corpus is included under one but not both subparagraphs.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 4-Joint Tenancy.
       </i>
       G, X, and Y owned property in joint tenancy. G died, survived by S, X, and Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because G’s fractional interest in the property immediately before death was one-third, and because that one-third fractional interest passed by right of survivorship to X and Y at G’s death, one-third of the value of the property at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(ii). This is the result whether or not under local law G had the unilateral right to sever her fractional interest. See Section 2-201(2) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(2)].
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 5-TOD Registered Securities and POD Account.
       </i>
       G registered securities that G owned in TOD form. G also contributed all the funds in a savings account that G registered in POD Form. X was designated to take the securities and Y was designated to take the savings account on G’s death. G died, survived by S, X, and Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because G was the sole owner of the securities immediately before death (see Sections 6-302 and 6-306 [N.D.C.C. §§
   30.1-31-22 and 30.1-31-26]), and because ownership of the securities passed to X upon G’s death (see Section 6-307 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-27]), the full value of the securities at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(iii). Because G contributed all the funds in the savings account, G’s ownership interest in the savings account immediately before death was 100 percent. See Section 6-211 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-08]. Because that 100 percentage ownership interest passed by right of survivorship to Y at G’s death, the full value of the account at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(iii).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 6-Joint Checking Account.
       </i>
       G, X, and Y were registered as co-owners of a joint checking account. G contributed 75 percent of the funds in the account. G died, survived by S, X, and Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       G’s ownership interest in the account immediately before death, determined under Section 6-211 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-08], was 75 percent of the account. Because that percentage ownership interest passed by right of survivorship to X and Y at G’s death, 75 percent of the value of the account at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(iii).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 7-Joint Checking Account.
       </i>
       G’s mother, M, added G’s name to her checking account so that G could pay her bills for her. M contributed all the funds in the account. The account was registered in co-ownership form with right of survivorship. G died, survived by S and M.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because G had contributed none of his own funds to the account, G’s ownership interest in the account immediately before death, determined under Section 6-211 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-08], was zero. Consequently, no part of the value of the account at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(iii).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 8-Life Insurance.
       </i>
       G, as owner of a life-insurance policy insuring her life, designated X and Y as the beneficiaries of that policy. G died owning the policy, survived by S, X, and Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full value of the proceeds of that policy is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(iv).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Paragraph (2)-Property Transferred by the Decedent During Marriage.
       </i>
       This category covers property that the decedent transferred in specified forms during “marriage” (defined in Section 2-201(3) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(3)] as “any marriage of the decedent to the decedent’s surviving spouse”). If the decedent and the surviving spouse were married to each other more than once, transfers that took place during any of their marriages to each other count as transfers during marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “transfer,” as it relates to a transfer by or of the decedent, is defined in Section 2-201(10) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(10)], as including “(A) an exercise or release of a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by the decedent, (B) a lapse at death of a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by the decedent, and (C) an exercise, release, or lapse of a general power of appointment that the decedent created in himself [or herself] and of a power described in Section 2-205(2)(ii) that the decedent conferred on a nonadverse party.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Paragraph (2) covers the following specific forms of transfer:
      </p>
      <p>
       (i) Any irrevocable transfer in which the decedent retained the right to the possession or enjoyment of, or to the income from, the property if and to the extent the decedent’s right terminated at or continued beyond the decedent’s death. The amount included is the value of the fraction of the property to which the decedent’s right related, to the extent the fraction of the property passed outside probate to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       (ii) Any transfer in which the decedent created a power over income or property, exercisable by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any other person, or exercisable by a nonadverse party, to or for the benefit of the decedent, creditors of the decedent, the decedent’s estate, or creditors of the decedent’s estate. The amount included with respect to a power over property is the value of the property subject to the power, and the amount included with respect to a power over income is the value of the property that produces or produced the income, to the extent the power in either case was exercisable at the decedent’s death to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent’s surviving spouse or to the extent the property passed at the decedent’s death, by exercise, release, lapse, in default, or otherwise, to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse. If the power is a power over both income and property and the preceding sentence produces different amounts, the amount included is the greater amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       Various aspects of paragraph (2) are illustrated by the following examples. Other examples illustrating various aspects of this paragraph are Examples 1 and 3, above, and Example 22 in the Comment to Section 2-206, below. In the following examples, as in the examples above, G is the decedent and S is the decedent’s surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 9-Retained Income Interest for Life.
       </i>
       Before death, and during marriage, G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, providing for the income to be paid annually to G for life, then for the corpus of the trust to go to X. G died, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of the corpus of the trust at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (2)(i). This paragraph applies to a retained income interest that terminates at the decedent’s death, as here. The amount included is the value of the property that passes outside probate to any person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse, which in this case is the full value of the corpus that passes outside probate to X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had G retained the right to only one-half of the income, with the other half payable to Y for G’s lifetime, only one half of the value of the corpus at G’s death would have been included under paragraph (2)(i) because that paragraph specifies that “the amount included is the value of the fraction of the property to which the decedent’s right related.” Note, however, that if G had created the trust within two years before death, paragraph (3)(iii) would require the inclusion of the value at the date the trust was established of the other half of the income interest for G’s life and of the remainder interest in the other half of the corpus, each value to be reduced by as much as $10,000 as appropriate under the facts, taking into account other gifts made to Y and to X in the same year, if any.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 10-Retained Unitrust Interest for a Term.
       </i>
       Before death, and during marriage, G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, providing for a fixed percentage of the value of the corpus of the trust (determined annually) to be paid annually to G for ten years, then for the corpus of the trust (and any accumulated income) to go to X. G died six years after the trust was created, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full value of the corpus at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under a combination of Sections 2-204 and 2-205(2)(i).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-205(2)(i) requires the inclusion of the commuted value of X’s remainder interest at G’s death. This paragraph applies to a retained income interest, which under Section 2-201(9) includes a unitrust interest. Moreover, Section 2-205(2)(i) not only applies to a retained income interest that terminates at the decedent’s death, but also applies to a retained income interest that continues beyond the decedent’s death, as here. The amount included is the value of the interest that passes outside probate to a person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse, which in this case is the commuted value of X’s remainder interest at G’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-204 requires the inclusion of the commuted value of the remaining four years of G’s unitrust interest because that interest passes through G’s probate estate to G’s devisees or heirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because both the four-year unitrust interest and the remainder interest that directly succeeds it are included in the augmented estate, there is no need to derive separate values for X’s remainder interest and for G’s remaining unitrust interest. The sum of the two values will equal the full value of the corpus, and that is the value that is included in the augmented estate. (Note, however, that for purposes of Section 2-209 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-03] (Sources from Which Elective Share Payable), it might become necessary to derive separate values for these two interests.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the trust been revocable, the end-result would have been the same. The only difference would be that the revocabilty of the trust would cause paragraph (2)(i) to be inapplicable, but would also cause overlapping application of paragraphs (1)(i) and (2)(ii) to X’s remainder interest. Because each of these paragraphs yields the same value, Section 2-208(c) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(5)] would require the commuted value of X’s remainder interest to be included in the augmented estate under any one, but only one, of them. Note that neither paragraphs (1)(i) nor (2)(ii) would apply to G’s remaining four-year term because that four-year term would have passed to G’s estate by lapse of G’s power to revoke. As above, the commuted value of G’s remaining four-year term would be included in the augmented estate under Section 2-204, obviating the need to derive separate valuations of G’s four-year term and X’s remainder interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 11-Personal Residence Trust.
       </i>
       Before death, and during marriage, G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust of G’s personal residence, retaining the right to occupy the residence for ten years, then for the residence to go to X. G died six years after the trust was created, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full value of the residence at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under a combination of Sections 2-204 and 2-205(2)(i).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-205(2)(i) requires the inclusion of the commuted value of X’s remainder interest at G’s death. This paragraph applies to a retained right to possession that continues beyond the decedent’s death, as here. The amount included is the value of the interest that passes outside probate to a person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse, which in this case is the commuted value of X’s remainder interest at G’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-204 requires the inclusion of the commuted value of G’s remaining four-year term because that interest passes through G’s probate estate to G’s devisees or heirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       As in Example 10, there is no need to derive separate valuations of the remaining four-year term and the remainder interest that directly succeeds it. The sum of the two values will equal the full value of the residence at G’s death, and that is the amount included in the augmented estate. (Note, however, that for purposes of Section 2-209 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-03] (Sources from Which Elective Share Payable), it might become necessary to derive separate values for these two interests.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 12-Retained Annuity Interest for a Term.
       </i>
       Before death, and during marriage, G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, providing for a fixed dollar amount to be paid annually to G for ten years, then for half of the corpus of the trust to go to X; the other half was to remain in trust for an additional five years, after which time the remaining corpus was to go to X. G died fourteen years after the trust was created, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of the one-half of the corpus of the trust remaining at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under a combination of Sections 2-204 and 2-205(2)(i). The other one-half of the corpus of the trust that was distributed to X four years before G’s death is not included in the augmented estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-205(2)(i) requires the inclusion of the commuted value of X’s remainder interest in half of the corpus of the trust. This section applies to a retained income interest, which under Section 2-201(9) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(9)], includes an annuity interest that continues beyond the decedent’s death, as here. The amount included is the value of the interest that passes outside probate to a person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse, which in this case is the commuted value of X’s remainder interest at G’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-204 requires the inclusion of the commuted value of the remaining one year of G’s annuity interest in half of the corpus of the trust, which passed through G’s probate estate to G’s devisees of heirs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no need to derive separate valuations of G’s remaining annuity interest and X’s remainder interest that directly succeeds it. The sum of the two values will equal the full value of the remaining one-half of the corpus of the trust at G’s death, and that is the amount included in the augmented estate. (Note, however, that for purposes of Section 2- 209 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-03] (Sources from Which Elective Share Payable), it might become necessary to derive separate values for these two interests.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Had G died eleven years after the trust was created, so that the termination of half of the trust would have occurred within the two-year period next preceding G’s death, the value of the half of the corpus of the trust that was distributed to X ten years after the trust was created would also have been included in the augmented estate under Section 2-205(3)(i).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 13-Commercial Annuity.
       </i>
       Before G’s death, and during marriage, G purchased three commercial annuities from an insurance company. Annuity One was a single-life annuity that paid a fixed sum to G annually and that contained a refund feature payable to X if G died within ten years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Annuity Two was a single-life annuity that paid a fixed sum to G annually, but contained no refund feature. Annuity Three was a self and survivor annuity that paid a fixed sum to G annually for life, and then paid a fixed sum annually to X for life. G died six years after purchasing the annuities, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Annuity One: The value of the refund payable to X at G’s death under Annuity One is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (2)(i). G retained an income interest, as defined in Section 2-201(9) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(9)], that terminated at G’s death. The amount included is the value of the interest that passes outside probate to a person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse, which in this case is the refund amount to which X is entitled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Annuity Two: Annuity Two does not cause any value to be included in the augmented estate because it expired at G’s death; although G retained an income interest, as defined in Section 2-201(9), that terminated at G’s death, nothing passed outside probate to any person other than G’s estate or surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Annuity Three: The commuted value at G’s death of the annuity payable to X under Annuity Three is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (2)(i). G retained an income interest, as defined in Section 2-201(9), that terminated at G’s death. The amount included is the value of the interest that passes outside probate to a person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse, which in this case is the commuted value of X’s right to the annuity payments for X’s lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 14-Joint Power.
       </i>
       Before death, and during marriage, G created an inter-vivos trust, providing for the income to go to X for life, remainder in corpus at X’s death to X’s then-living descendants, by representation; if none, to a specified charity. G retained a power, exercisable only with the consent of X, allowing G to withdraw all or any portion of the corpus at any time during G’s lifetime. G died without exercising the power, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of the corpus of the trust at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (2)(ii). This paragraph applies to a power created by the decedent over the corpus of the trust that is exercisable by the decedent “in conjunction with any other person,” who in this case is X. Note that the fact that X has an interest in the trust that would be adversely affected by the exercise of the power in favor of G is irrelevant. The amount included is the full value of the corpus of the trust at G’s death because the power related to the full corpus of the trust and the full corpus passed at the decedent’s death, by lapse or default of the power, to a person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse-X, X’s descendants, and the specified charity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 15-Power in Nonadverse Party.
       </i>
       Before death, and during marriage, G created an inter-vivos trust, providing for the income to go to X for life, remainder in corpus to X’s then-living descendants, by representation; if none, to a specified charity. G conferred a power on the trustee, a bank, to distribute, in the trustee’s complete and uncontrolled discretion, all or any portion of the trust corpus to G or to X. One year before G’s death, the trustee distributed $50,000 of trust corpus to G and $40,000 of trust corpus to X. G died, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full value of the portion of the corpus of the trust remaining at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (2)(ii). This paragraph applies to a power created by the decedent over the corpus of the trust that is exercisable by a “nonadverse party.” As defined in Section 2-201(4) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(4)], the term “nonadverse party” is “a person who does not have a substantial beneficial interest in the trust or other property arrangement that would be adversely affected by the exercise or nonexercise of the power that he [or she] possesses respecting the trust or other property arrangement.” The trustee in this case is a nonadverse party. The amount included is the full value of the corpus of the trust at G’s death because the trustee’s power related to the full corpus of the trust and the full corpus passed at the decedent’s death, by lapse or default of the power, to a person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse-X, X’s descendants, and the specified charity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to the full value of the remaining corpus at G’s death, an additional amount is included in the augmented estate because of the $40,000 distribution of corpus to X within two years before G’s death. As defined in Section 2-201(10) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(10)], a transfer of the decedent includes the exercise “of a power described in Section 2-205(2)(ii) that the decedent conferred on a nonadverse party.” Consequently, the $40,000 distribution to X is considered to be a transfer of the decedent within two years before death, and is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (3)(iii) to the extent it exceeded $10,000 of the aggregate gifts to X that year. If no other gifts were made to X in that year, the amount included would be $30,000 ($40,000 — $10,000).

        Paragraph (3)-Property Transferred by the Decedent During Marriage and During the Two-Year Period Next Preceding the Decedent’s Death.
       </i>
       This paragraph-called the two-year rule-requires inclusion in the augmented estate of the value of property that the decedent transferred in specified forms during marriage and within two years of death. The word “transfer,” as it relates to a transfer by or of the decedent, is defined in Section 2-201(10) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(10)], as including “(A) an exercise or release of a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by the decedent, (B) a lapse at death of a presently exercisable general power of appointment held by the decedent, and (C) an exercise, release, or lapse of a general power of appointment that the decedent created in himself [or herself] and of a power described in Section 2-205(2)(ii) that the decedent conferred on a nonadverse party.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The two-year rule of paragraph (3) covers the following specific forms of transfer:
      </p>
      <p>
       (i) Any property that passed as a result of the termination of a right or interest in, or power over, property that would have been included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(i), (ii), or (iii), or under paragraph (2), if the right, interest, or power had not terminated until the decedent’s death. The amount included is the value of the property that would have been included under those paragraphs if the property were valued at the time the right, interest, or power terminated, and is included only to the extent the property passed upon termination to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent or the decedent’s estate, spouse, or surviving spouse. As used in this subparagraph “termination,” with respect to a right or interest in property, occurs when the right or interest terminated by the terms of the governing instrument or the decedent transferred or relinquished the right or interest, and, with respect to a power over property, occurs when the power terminated by exercise, release, lapse, default, or otherwise, but, with respect to a power described in paragraph (1)(i), “termination” occurs when the power terminated by exercise or release, but not otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       (ii) Any transfer of or relating to an insurance policy on the life of the decedent if the proceeds would have been included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(iv) had the transfer not occurred. The amount included is the value of the insurance proceeds to the extent the proceeds were payable at the decedent’s death to or for the benefit of any person other than the decedent’s estate or surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       (iii) Any transfer of property, to the extent not otherwise included in the augmented estate, made to or for the benefit of a person other than the decedent’s surviving spouse. The amount included is the value of the transferred property to the extent the aggregate transfers to any one donee in either of the two years exceeded $10,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Various aspects of paragraph (3) are illustrated by the following examples. Other examples illustrating various aspects of this paragraph are Examples 2, 9, 12, 14, and 15, above, and Examples 33 and 34 in the Comment to Section 2-207, below. In the following examples, as in the examples above, G is the decedent and S is the decedent’s surviving spouse.

       <i>
        Example 16-Retained Income Interest Terminating Within Two Years Before Death.
       </i>
       Before death, and during marriage, G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, providing for the income to go to G for ten years, then for the corpus of the trust to go to X. G died 11 years after the trust was created, survived by S and X. G was married to S when the trust terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full value of the corpus of the trust at the date of its termination is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (3)(i). The full value of the corpus at death would have been included in the augmented estate under paragraph (2)(i) had G’s income interest not terminated until death; G’s income interest terminated within the two-year period next preceding G’s death; G was married to S when the trust was created and when the income interest terminated; and the trust corpus upon termination passed to a person other than S, G, or G’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 17-Personal Residence Trust Terminating Within Two Years Before Death.
       </i>
       Before death, and during marriage, G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust of G’s personal residence, retaining the right to occupy the residence for ten years, then for the residence to go to X. G died eleven years after the trust was created, survived by S and X. G was married to S when the right to possession terminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full value of the residence at the date the trust terminated is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (3)(i). The full value of the residence would have been included in the augmented estate under paragraph (2)(i) had G’s right to possession not terminated until death; G’s right to possession terminated within the two-year period next preceding G’s death; G was married to S when the trust was created and when the right to possession terminated; and the residence passed upon termination to a person other than S, G, or G’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 18-Irrevocable Assignment of Life-Insurance Policy Within Two Years Before Death.
       </i>
       In Example 8, G irrevocably assigned the lifeinsurance policy to X and Y within two years preceding G’s death. G was married to S when the policy was assigned. G died, survived by S, X, and Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       The full value of the proceeds are included in the augmented estate under paragraph (3)(ii). The full value of the proceeds would have been included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(iv) had G owned the policy at death; G assigned the policy within the two-year period next preceding G’s death; G was married to S when the policy was assigned; and the proceeds were payable to a person other than S or G’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 19-Property Purchased in Joint Tenancy Within Two Years Before Death.
       </i>
       Within two years before death, and during marriage, G and X purchased property in joint tenancy; G contributed $75,000 of the $100,000 purchase price and X contributed $25,000. G died, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of when or by whom the property was purchased, the value at G’s death of G’s fractional interest of one-half is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(ii) because G’s half passed to X as surviving joint tenant. Because the property was purchased within two years before death, and during marriage, and because G’s contribution exceeded the value of G’s fractional interest in the property, the excess contribution of $25,000 constitutes a gift to X within the two-year period next preceding G’s death. Consequently, an additional $15,000 ($25,000 minus $10,000) is included in the augmented estate under paragraph (3)(iii) as a gift to X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had G provided all of the $100,000 purchase price, then paragraph (3)(iii) would require $40,000 ($50,000 minus $10,000) to be included in the augmented estate (in addition to the inclusion of one-half the value of the property at G’s death under paragraph (1)(ii).
      </p>
      <p>
       Had G provided one-half or less of the $100,000 purchase price, then G would not have made a gift to X within the two-year period next preceding G’s death. Half the value of the property at G’s death would still be included in the augmented estate under paragraph (1)(ii), however.

        Comment to 2-206 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(2)(c)].
       </b>
       This section, which in the 1990 version appeared in substance as a paragraph of a single, long section defining the augmented estate, establishes as the third component of the augmented estate the value of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to the decedent’s surviving spouse. Under this section, the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to the decedent’s surviving spouse:
      </p>
      <p>
       consist of all property that passed outside probate at the decedent’s death from the decedent to the surviving spouse by reason of the decedent’s death, including:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-05s30.1-05-02-Sourceol11">
        the decedent’s fractional interest in property held as a joint tenant with the right of survivorship, to the extent that the decedent’s fractional interest passed to the surviving spouse as surviving joint tenant,
       </li>
       <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-05s30.1-05-02-Sourceol12">
        the decedent’s ownership interest in property or accounts held in co-ownership registration with the right of survivorship, to the extent the decedent’s ownership interest passed to the surviving spouse as surviving co-owner, and
       </li>
       <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-05s30.1-05-02-Sourceol13">
        all other property that would have been included in the augmented estate under Section 2-205(1) or (2) had it passed to or for the benefit of a person other than the decedent’s spouse, surviving spouse, the decedent, or the decedent’s creditors, estate, or estate creditors.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Property passing to the surviving spouse under the federal Social Security system is excluded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Various aspects of Section 2-206 are illustrated by the following examples. In these examples, as in the examples in the Comment to Section 2-205, above, G is the decedent and S is the decedent’s surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 20-Tenancy by the Entirety.
       </i>
       G and S own property in tenancy by the entirety. G died, survived by S.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the definition in Section 1-201 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06] of “joint tenants with the right of survivorship” includes tenants by the entirety, the provisions of Section 2-206 relating to joint tenancies with right of survivorship apply to tenancies by the entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
       In total, therefore, the full value of the property is included in the augmented estate-G’s one-half under Section 2-206(1) and S’s one-half under Section 2-207(a)(1)(i).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-206(1) requires the inclusion of the value of G’s one-half fractional interest because it passed to S as surviving joint tenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-207(a)(1)(i) requires the inclusion of S’s one-half fractional interest. Because G was a joint tenant immediately before G’s death, S’s fractional interest, for purposes of Section 2-207, is determined immediately before G’s death, disregarding the fact that G predeceased S. Immediately before G’s death, S’s fractional interest was then a one-half fractional interest. Despite Section 2-205(1)(ii), none of S’s fractional interest is included under Section 2-207(a)(2) because that provision does not apply to fractional interests that are included under Section 2-207(a)(1)(i). Consequently, the value of S’s one-half interest is included under Section 2-207(a)(1)(i) but not under Section 2-207(a)(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 21-Joint Tenancy. G, S, and X own property in joint tenancy.

       G died more than two years after the property was titled in that form, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       In total, two-thirds of the value of the property at G’s death is included in the augmented estate-one-sixth under Section 2-205, one-sixth under Section 2-206, and one-third under Section 2-207.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-205(1)(ii) requires the inclusion of half of the value of G’s one-third fractional interest because that half passed by right of survivorship to X.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-206(1) requires the inclusion of the value of the other half of G’s one-third fractional interest because that half passed to S as surviving joint tenant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-207(a)(1)(i) requires the inclusion of the value of S’s one-third interest. Because G was a joint tenant immediately before G’s death, S’s fractional interest, for purposes of Section 2-207, is determined immediately before G’s death, disregarding the fact that G predeceased S. Immediately before G’s death, S’s fractional interest was then a one-third fractional interest. Despite Section 2-205(1)(ii), none of S’s fractional interest is included under Section 2-207(a)(2) because that provision does not apply to fractional interests that are included under Section 2-207(a)(1)(i). Consequently, the value of S’s one-third fractional interest is included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207(a)(1)(i) but not under Section 2-207(a)(2).

      </p>
      <p>
       The full value of the corpus of the trust at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under a combination of Sections 2-205 and 2-206.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-206(3) requires the inclusion of the commuted value of S’s income interest. Note that, although S owns the income interest as of G’s death, the value of S’s income interest is not included under Section 2-207 because Section 2-207 only includes property interests that are not included under Section 2-206.

       G’s ownership interest in the account immediately before death, determined under Section 6-211 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-08], was 75 percent of the account. Because that percentage ownership interest passed by right of survivorship to S at G’s death, 75 percent of the value of the account at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under Section 2-206. The remaining 25 percent of the account is included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207.

        Comment to 2-207 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(2)(d)].
       </b>
       This section, which in the 1990 version appeared in substance as a paragraph of a single, long section defining the augmented estate, establishes as the fourth component of the augmented estate the value of property owned by the surviving spouse at the decedent’s death plus the value of amounts that would have been includible in the surviving spouse’s nonprobate transfers to others had the spouse been the decedent, reduced by enforceable claims against that property or that spouse, as provided in Sections 2-207(c) and 2-208(b)(1). Property owned by the decedent’s surviving spouse does not include the value of enhancements to the surviving spouse’s earning capacity (e.g., the value of a law, medical, or business degree).
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that amounts that would have been includible in the surviving spouse’s nonprobate transfers to others under Section 2-205(1)(iv) are not valued as if he or she were deceased. Thus, if, at the decedent’s death, the surviving spouse owns a $1 million life-insurance policy on his or her life, payable to his or her sister, that policy would not be valued at its face value of $1 million, but rather could be valued under the method used in the federal estate tax under Treas. Reg. § 20.2031-8.
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of combining the estates and nonprobate transfers of both spouses is to implement a partnership or marital-sharing theory. Under that theory, there is a fifty/fifty split of the property acquired by both spouses. Hence the redesigned elective share includes the survivor’s net assets in the augmented-estate entity. (Under a different rationale, no longer appropriate under the redesigned system, the pre-1990 version of Section 2-202 also added the value of property owned by the surviving spouse, but only to the extent the owned property had been derived from the decedent. An incidental benefit of the redesigned system is that this tracing-to-source feature of the pre-1990 version is eliminated.)

      <p>
       The value of the corpus of the trust at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207(a)(1) as either an interest owned by S at G’s death or as an interest that passed to the spouse by reason of G’s death.

Despite Section 2-205(1)(ii), none of S’s fractional interest is included under Section 2-207(a)(2) because that provision does not apply to fractional interests required to be included under Section 2-207(a)(1)(i).

       Before G’s death, and during marriage, S created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, providing for the income to go to S for life, then for the income to go to G for life, then for the corpus of the trust to go to X. G died, survived by S and X.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of the trust corpus at G’s death is included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207(a)(2) because, if S were the decedent, that value would be included in the spouse’s nonprobate transfers to others under Section 2-205(2)(i). Note that property included under Section 2- 207 is valued at the decedent’s death, taking the fact that the decedent predeceased the spouse into account. Thus, G’s remainder in income for life is extinguished, and the full value of the corpus is included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207(a)(2). The commuted value of S’s income interest would also be included under Section 2-207(a)(1) but for the fact that Section 2-208(c) provides that when two provisions apply to the same property interest, the interest is not included under both provisions, but is included under the provision yielding the highest value. Consequently, since Section 2-207(a)(2) yields a higher value (the full corpus) than Section 2-207(a)(1) (the income interest), and since the income interest is part of the value of the corpus, and hence both provisions apply to the same property interest, the full corpus is included under Section 2-207(a)(2) and nothing is included under Section 2-207(a)(1).

       The commuted value of S’s income interest as of G’s death is included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207. If G had created the trust within the two-year period next preceding G’s death, the commuted value of X’s remainder interest as of the date of the creation of the trust (less $10,000, assuming G made no other gifts to X in that year) would also have been included in the augmented estate under Section 2- 205(3)(iii).

        Subsection (a) [N.D.C.C. §
    30.1-05-02(3)].
       </i>
       This subsection excludes from the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others the value of any property (i) to the extent that the decedent received adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth for a transfer of the property or (ii) if the property was transferred with the written joinder of, or if the transfer was consented to in writing before or after the transfer by, the surviving spouse.

        Consenting to Split-Gift Treatment Not Consent to the Transfer.

       Spousal consent to split-gift treatment under I.R.C. § 2513 does not constitute written joinder of or consent to the transfer by the spouse for purposes of subsection (a).

       <i>
        Obtaining the Charitable Deduction for Transfers Coming Within Section 2-205(2) or (3).
       </i>
       Because, under Section 2-201(10) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-05-02(a)(10)], the term “right to income” includes a right to payments under an annuity trust or a unitrust, the value of a charitable remainder trust established by a married grantor without written spousal consent or joinder would be included in the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others under Section 2-205(2)(A). Consequently, a married grantor planning to establish a charitable remainder trust is advised to obtain the written consent of his or her spouse to the transfer, as provided in Section 2-208(a), in order to be assured of qualifying for the charitable deduction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, outright gifts made by a married donor within two years preceding death are included in the augmented estate under Section 2- 205(3)(C) to the extent that the aggregate gifts to any one donee exceed the amount excludable from taxable gifts under 26 U.S.C. Section 2503(b) [or its successor] on the date next preceding the date of the decedent’s death (or, if referring to federal law is considered an unlawful delegation of legislative power, $12,000) in either of the two years. Consequently, a married donor planning to donate more than that amount to any charitable organization within a twelve-month period is advised to obtain the written consent of his or her spouse to the transfer, as provided in Section 2- 208(a), in order to be assured of qualifying for the charitable deduction.

        Spousal Waiver of ERISA Benefits.
       </i>
       Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), death benefits under an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA must be paid in the form of an annuity to the surviving spouse. A married employee wishing to designate someone other than the spouse must obtain a waiver from the spouse. As amended in 1984 by the Retirement Equity Act, ERISA requires each employee benefit plan subject to its provisions to provide that an election of a waiver shall not take effect unless (i) the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designation by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse’s consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public.
      </p>
      <p>
       See 29 U.S.C. § 1055(c) (1988); Int.Rev.Code § 417(a). Any spousal waiver that complies with these requirements would satisfy Section 2-208(a) and would serve to exclude the value of the death benefits from the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others.

       Section 2-209 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-03] is an integral part of the overall redesign of the elective share. It establishes the priority to be used in determining the sources from which the elective-share amount is payable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a) [subsec. (1)].
       </b>
       Subsection (a) applies only to the elective-share amount determined under Section 2-202(a), not to the supplemental elective-share amount determined under Section 2-202(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-01(1)]. Under subsection (a), the following are counted first toward satisfying the elective-share amount (to the extent they are included in the augmented estate):

       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Under subsection (b) [this subparagraph has been omitted from North Dakota’s adoption of this section], the marital-property portion of amounts included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207 is computed by multiplying the value of the amounts included in the augmented estate under Section 2-207 by the percentage of the augmented estate set forth in the schedule in Section 2-203(b) [not adopted by North Dakota] appropriate to the length of time the spouse and the decedent were married to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the combined value of the amounts described in subsection (a)(1) and (2) equals or exceeds the elective-share amount, the surviving spouse is not entitled to any further amount from the decedent’s probate estate or recipients of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others, unless the surviving spouse is entitled to a supplemental elective-share amount under Section 2-202(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-01(2)].

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsections (c) and (d) [Subsec. (2) and (3)].
       </b>
       Subsections (c) and (d) apply to both the elective-share amount and the supplemental elective-share amount, if any. As to the elective-share amount determined under Section 2-202(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-01(1)], the decedent’s probate estate and nonprobate transfers to others become liable only if and to the extent that the amounts described in subsection (a) are insufficient to satisfy the elective-share amount. The decedent’s probate estate and nonprobate transfers to others are fully liable for the supplemental elective-share amount determined under Section 2-202(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-01(2)], if any.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (c) and (d) establish a layer of priority within the decedent’s net probate estate (other than assets passing to the surviving spouse by testate or intestate succession) and nonprobate transfers to others. The decedent’s probate estate and that portion of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others that was not included in the augmented estate under Section 2-205(1), (2), and 3(B) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(b)] are liable first. Only if and to the extent that those amounts are insufficient does the remaining portion of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others become liable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the exempt property and allowances provided by Sections 2-401 [N.D.C.C. §
   <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-07s30.1-07-00.1" target="_self">30.1-07-00.1</a></cite>], 2-402 [not adopted by North Dakota, see N.D.C.C §
   47-18-01], and 2-403 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-07-01] are not charged against, but are in addition to, the elective-share and supplemental elective-share amounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision that the spouse is charged with amounts that would have passed to the spouse but were disclaimed was deleted in 1993. That provision was introduced into the Code in 1975, prior to the addition of the QTIP provisions in the marital deduction of the federal estate tax. At that time, most devises to the surviving spouse were outright devises and did not require actuarial computation. Now, many if not most devises to the surviving spouse are in the form of an income interest that qualifies for the marital deduction under the QTIP provisions, and these devises require actuarial computations that should be avoided whenever possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “equitably” is eliminated from subsections (c) and (d) because it has caused confusion about whether it grants discretion to the court to apportion liability for the unsatisfied balance among the recipients of the decedent’s net probate estate and of that portion of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others in some proportion other than in proportion to the value of their interests therein. The intent of including that word in the earlier version was merely to describe the prescribed apportionment as “equitable,” not to grant authority to vary the prescribed apportionment [The word “equitably” has been retained in North Dakota’s version of this section; also note that subsection (e) of 2-209 has been omitted in North Dakota’s version].

        Whether widow waived her right to claim an elective share was so interconnected with the unresolved issue of what she would receive under the will, order denying her motion for an elective share was not appealable.

       This section is revised to coordinate the terminology with that used in revised Section 2-205 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(b)] and with the fact that an election can be made by a conservator, guardian, or agent on behalf of a surviving spouse, as provided in Section 2-212(a) [N.D.C.C. §

    Right of election personal to surviving spouse — Incapacitated surviving spouse.

       The right of election may be exercised only by a surviving spouse who is living when the petition for the elective share is filed in the court under subsection 1 of section 30.1-05-05. If the election is not exercised by the surviving spouse personally, it may be exercised on the surviving spouse’s behalf by the surviving spouse’s conservator, guardian, or agent under the authority of a power of attorney.

       If the election is exercised on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person, the court shall set aside that portion of the elective-share and supplemental elective-share amounts due from the decedent’s probate estate and recipients of the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others under subsections 2 and 3 of section 30.1-05-03 and shall appoint a trustee to administer that property for the support of the surviving spouse. For the purposes of this subsection, an election on behalf of a surviving spouse by an agent under a durable power of attorney is presumed to be on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person. The trustee shall administer the trust in accordance with the following terms and any additional terms as the court determines appropriate:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-05s30.1-05-06ol12a">
         Expenditures of income and principal may be made in the manner, when, and to the extent that the trustee determines suitable and proper for the surviving spouse’s support, without court order but with regard to other support, income, and property of the surviving spouse exclusive of benefits of medical or other forms of assistance from any state or federal government or governmental agency for which the surviving spouse must qualify on the basis of need.

        <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-05s30.1-05-06ol12b">
         During the surviving spouse’s incapacity, neither the surviving spouse nor anyone acting on behalf of the surviving spouse has a power to terminate the trust; but if the surviving spouse regains capacity, the surviving spouse then acquires the power to terminate the trust and acquire full ownership of the trust property free of trust, by delivering to the trustee a writing signed by the surviving spouse declaring the termination.

       <b>
        Subsection (a) [Subsection (1)].
       </b>
       Subsection (a) is revised to make it clear that the right of election may be exercised only by or on behalf of a living surviving spouse. If the election is not made by the surviving spouse personally, it can be made on behalf of the surviving spouse by the spouse’s conservator, guardian, or agent. In any case, the surviving spouse must be alive when the election is made. The election cannot be made on behalf of a deceased surviving spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Alternative Subsection (b) [Subsection (2)].
       </b>
       For states that have not enacted the Uniform Custodial Trust Act, an Alternative subsection (b) is provided under which the court must set aside that portion of the elective-share and supplemental elective-share amounts which, under Section 2-209(c) and (d) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-03(2) and (3)], are due from the decedent’s probate estate and nonprobate transfers to others and must appoint a trustee to administer that property for the support of the surviving spouse, in accordance with the terms set forth in Alternative subsection (b).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Planning for an Incapacitated Surviving Spouse Not Disrupted.
       </b>
       Note that the portion of the elective-share or supplemental elective-share amounts that go into the custodial or support trust is that portion due from the decedent’s probate estate and nonprobate transfers to others under Section 2-209(c) and (d) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-03(2) and (3)]. These amounts constitute the involuntary transfers to the surviving spouse under the elective-share system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amounts voluntarily transferred to the surviving spouse under the decedent’s will, by intestacy, or by nonprobate transfer, if any, do not go into the custodial or support trust. Thus, estate planning measures deliberately established for a surviving spouse who is incapacitated are not disrupted. For example, the decedent’s will might establish a trust that qualifies for or that can be elected as qualifying for the federal estate tax marital deduction. Although the value of the surviving spouse’s interests in such a trust count toward satisfying the elective-share amount under Section 2-209(a)(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-03(1)(a)], the trust itself is not dismantled by virtue of Section 2-212(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-06(2)] in order to force that property into the nonqualifying custodial or support trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rationale.
       </b>
       The approach of this section is based on a general expectation that most surviving spouses are, at the least, generally aware of and accept their decedents’ overall estate plans and are not antagonistic to them. Consequently, to elect the elective share, and not have the disposition of that part of it that is payable from the decedent’s probate estate and nonprobate transfers to others under Section 2-209(c) and (d) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-03(2) and (3)] governed by subsections (b) and (c), the surviving spouse must not be an incapacitated person. When the election is made by or on behalf of a surviving spouse who is not an incapacitated person, the surviving spouse has personally signified his or her opposition to the decedent’s overall estate plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the election is made on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person, subsections (b) and (c) control the disposition of that part of the elective-share amount or supplemental elective-share amount payable under Section 2-209(c) and (d) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-03(2) and (3)] from the decedent’s probate estate and nonprobate transfers to others. The purpose of subsections (b) and (c), generally speaking, is to assure that that part of the elective share is devoted to the personal economic benefit and needs of the surviving spouse, but not to the economic benefit of the surviving spouse’s heirs or devisees.

       Although under section 30.1-05-02 a payment, item of property, or other benefit is included in the decedent’s nonprobate transfers to others, a payer or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument, or for having taken any other action in reliance on the validity of a governing instrument, upon request and satisfactory proof of the decedent’s death, before the payer or other third party received written notice from the surviving spouse or spouse’s representative of an intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed. A payer or other third party is liable only for actions taken two or more business days after the payer or other third party received written notice of an intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed. The written notice must indicate the name of the decedent, the date of the decedent’s death, the name of the person asserting an interest, the nature of the payment or item of property or other benefit, and a statement that the spouse intends to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed. Any form of service of notice other than that described in subsection 2 is not sufficient to impose liability on a payer or other third party for actions taken pursuant to the governing instrument.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-05s30.1-05-08ol12">
       The written notice must be mailed to the payer’s or other third party’s main office or home by registered mail or served upon the payer or third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Notice to a sales representative of the payer or other third party does not constitute notice to the payer or other third party. Upon receipt of written notice of intention to file a petition for the elective share or that a petition for the elective share has been filed, a payer or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent’s estate, or if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents’ estates located in the county of the decedent’s residence. The availability of an action under this section does not prevent the payer or other third party from taking any other action authorized by law or the governing instrument. If no probate proceedings have been commenced, the payer or other third party shall file with the court a copy of the written notice received by the payer or other third party, with the payment of funds or transfer or deposit of property. The court may not charge a filing fee to the payer or other third party for any such payment, transfer, or deposit with the court, even if no probate proceedings have been commenced before the payment, transfer, or deposit. The court shall hold the funds or items of property and, upon its determination under subsection 4 of section 30.1-05-05, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. If no petition is filed in the court within the specified time under subsection 1 of section 30.1-05-05, or, if filed, the demand for an elective share is withdrawn under subsection 3 of section 30.1-05-05, the court shall order disbursement to the designated beneficiary. A filing fee, if any, may be charged upon disbursement either to the recipient or against the funds or property on deposit with the court, in the discretion of the court. Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payer or other third party from all claims under the governing instrument or applicable law for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

        Purpose and Scope of the Revisions.
       </b>
       This section applies only to a premarital will, a will executed prior to the testator’s marriage to his or her surviving spouse. If the decedent and the surviving spouse were married to each other more than once, a premarital will is a will executed by the decedent at any time when they were not married to each other but not a will executed during a prior marriage. This section reflects the view that the intestate share of the spouse in that portion of the testator’s estate not devised to certain of the testator’s children, under trust or not, (or that is not devised to their descendants, under trust or not, or does not pass to their descendants under the anti-lapse statute) is what the testator would want the spouse to have if he or she had thought about the relationship of his or her old will to the new situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, a surviving spouse who married the testator after the testator executed his or her will may be entitled to a certain minimum amount of the testator’s estate. The surviving spouse’s entitlement under this section, if any, is granted automatically; it need not be elected. If the surviving spouse exercises his or her right to take an elective share, amounts provided under this section count toward making up the elective-share amount by virtue of the language in subsection (a) stating that the amount provided by this section is treated as “an intestate share.” Under Section 2-209(a)(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-03(1)(a)], amounts passing to the surviving spouse by intestate succession count first toward making up the spouse’s elective-share amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a) [subsection (1)].
       </b>
       Subsection (a) is revised to make it clear that a surviving spouse who, by a premarital will, is devised, under trust or not, less than the share of the testator’s estate he or she would have received had the testator died intestate as to that part of the estate, if any, not devised to certain of the testator’s children, under trust or not, (or that is not devised to their descendants, under trust or not, or does not pass to their descendants under the anti-lapse statute) is entitled to be brought up to that share. Subsection (a) was amended in 1993 to make it clear that any lapsed devise that passes under section 2-604 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-06] to a child of the testator by a prior marriage, rather than only to a descendant of such a child, is covered.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example.
       </i>
       G’s will devised the residue of his estate “to my two children, A and B, in equal shares.” A and B are children of G’s prior marriage. G is survived by A and by G’s new spouse, X. B predeceases G, without leaving any descendants who survived G by 120 hours. Under Section 2-604 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-06], B’s half of the residue passes to G’s child, A. A is a child of the testator’s prior marriage but not a descendant of B. X’s rights under Section 2-301 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-06-01] are to take an intestate share in that portion of G’s estate not covered by the residuary clause.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pre-1990 version of Section 2-301 was titled “Omitted Spouse,” and the section used phrases such as “fails to provide” and “omitted spouse.” The implication of the title and these phrases was that the section was inapplicable if the person the decedent later married was a devisee in his or her premarital will. It was clear, however, from the underlying purpose of the section that this was not intended. The Courts recognized this and refused to interpret the section that way, but in doing so they have been forced to say that a premarital will containing a devise to the person to whom the testator was married at death could still be found to “fail to provide” for the survivor in the survivor’s capacity as spouse. See Estate of Christensen, 665 P.2d 646 (Utah 1982); Estate of Ganier, 418 So.2d 256 (Fla.1982); Note, “The Problem of the ‘Un-omitted’ Spouse Under Section 2-301 of the [Pre-1990] Uniform Probate Code,” 52 U.Chi. L. Rev. 481 (1985). By making the existence and amount of a premarital devise to the spouse irrelevant, the revisions of subsection (a) make the operation of the statute more purposive.

       <b>
        Subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3) Exceptions [subsections (1)(a), (b) and (c)].
       </b>
       The moving party has the burden of proof on the exceptions contained in subsections (a)(1), (2), and (3). For a case interpreting the language of subsection (a)(3), see Estate of Bartell, 776 P.2d 885 (Utah 1989). This section can be barred by a premarital agreement, marital agreement, or waiver as provided in Section 2-213 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-07].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b) [subsection (2)].
       </b>
       Subsection (b) is also revised to provide that the value of any premarital devise to the surviving spouse, equitable or legal, is used first to satisfy the spouse’s entitlement under this section, before any other devises suffer abatement. This revision is made necessary by the revision of subsection (a): If the existence or amount of a premarital devise to the surviving spouse is irrelevant, any such devise must be counted toward and not be in addition to the ultimate share to which the spouse is entitled. Normally, a devise in favor of the person whom the testator later marries will be a specific or general devise, not a residuary devise. The effect under the pre-1990 version of subsection (b) was that the surviving spouse could take the intestate share under Section 2-301, which in the pre-1990 version was satisfied out of the residue (under the rules of abatement in Section 3-902 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-0-20-02]), plus the devise in his or her favor. The revision of subsection (b) prevents this “double dipping,” so to speak.

        Where decedent had a new will drawn up in which he left the bulk of his estate to his “wife,” where a footnote appearing in the document indicated that the will was prepared in anticipation of his wedding, and where the decedent died three days before his wedding, the probate court did not err in ruling that the terms “spouse” and “wife” as used and defined in the decedent’s will were descriptive of his fiancee and did not create a condition precedent to her right to receive the devises because the will’s definition of “spouse” and references to the decedent’s fiancee as his “spouse” were descriptive terms that did not create a condition precedent; rather, the footnote evidenced the decedent’s intent that the will be operative before and after the marriage. The district court properly concluded that the fiancee was an unconditional devisee entitled to take under the decedent’s will; the fiancee’s right to the devises to her vested at the decedent’s death.

      <p>
       This section provides for both the case where a child was born or adopted after the execution of the will and not foreseen at the time and thus not provided for in the will, and the rare case where a testator omits one of his or her children because of the mistaken belief that the child is dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Basic Purposes and Scope of Revisions.
       </b>
       This section is substantially revised. The revisions have two basic objectives. The first basic objective is to provide that a will that devised, under trust or not, all or substantially all of the testator’s estate to the other parent of the omitted child prevents an after-born or after-adopted child from taking an intestate share if none of the testator’s children was living when he or she executed the will. (Under this rule, the other parent must survive the testator and be entitled to take under the will.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the pre-1990 Code, such a will prevented the omitted child’s entitlement only if the testator had one or more children living when he or she executed the will. The rationale for the revised rule is found in the empirical evidence (cited in the Comment to section 2-102 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-02]) that suggests that even testators with children tend to devise their entire estates to their surviving spouses, especially in smaller estates. The testator’s purpose is not to disinherit the children; rather, such a will evidences a purpose to trust the surviving parent to use the property for the benefit of the children, as appropriate. This attitude of trust of the surviving parent carries over to the case where none of the children have been born when the will is executed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second basic objective of the revisions is to provide that if the testator had children when he or she executed the will, and if the will made provision for one or more of the then-living children, an omitted after-born or after-adopted child does not take a full intestate share (which might be substantially larger or substantially smaller than given to the living children). Rather, the omitted after-born or after-adopted child participates on a pro rata basis in the property devised, under trust or not, to the then-living children.
      </p>
      <p>
       A more detailed description of the revised rules follows.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        No Child Living When Will Executed.
       </b>
       If the testator had no child living when he or she executed the will, subsection (a)(1) [subsection 1(a)] provides that an omitted after-born or after-adopted child receives the share he or she would have received had the testator died intestate, unless the will devised, under trust or not, all or substantially all of the estate to the other parent of the omitted child. If the will did devise all or substantially all of the estate to the other parent of the omitted child, and if that other parent survives the testator and is entitled to take under the will, the omitted after-born or after-adopted child receives no share of the estate. In the case of an after-adopted child, the term “other parent” refers to the other adopting parent. (The other parent of the omitted child might survive the testator, but not be entitled to take under the will because, for example, that devise to the other parent was revoked under Section 2-803 or 2-804 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-03 or 30.1-10-04].)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        One or More Children Living When Will Executed.
       </b>
       If the testator had one or more children living when the will was executed, subsection (a)(2) [subsection (1)(b)], which implements the second basic objective stated above, provides that an omitted after-born or after-adopted child only receives a share of the testator’s estate if the testator’s will devised property or an equitable or legal interest in property to one or more of the children living at the time the will was executed; if not, the omitted after-born or after-adopted child receives nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(2) [subsection (1)(b)] is modeled on N.Y. Est. Powers &amp; Trusts Law § 5-3.2. Subsection (a)(2) is illustrated by the following example.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example.
       </i>
       When G executed her will, she had two living children, A and B. Her will devised $7,500 to each child. After G executed her will, she had another child, C.

       To preclude operation of subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), the testator’s will need not make any provision, even nominal in amount, for a testator’s present or future children; under subsection (b)(1) [subsection (2)(a)], a simple recital in the will that the testator intends to make no provision for then living children or any the testator thereafter may have would be sufficient.

       Subsection (c) [subsection (3)] addresses the problem that arises if at the time of execution of the will the testator fails to provide in his or her will for a living child solely because he or she believes the child to be dead. Extrinsic evidence is admissible to determine whether the testator omitted the living child solely because he or she believed the child to be dead. Cf. Section 2-601, Comment. If the child was omitted solely because of that belief, the child is entitled to share in the estate as if the child were an omitted after-born or after-adopted child.

      General Editorial Board Comment.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     For decedents who die domiciled in this State, this part grants various allowances to the decedent’s surviving spouse and certain children. The allowances have priority over unsecured creditors of the estate and persons to whom the estate may be devised by will. If there is a surviving spouse, all of the allowances described in this Part, which (as revised to adjust for inflation) total $25,000, plus whatever is allowed to the spouse for support during administration, normally pass to the spouse. If the surviving spouse and minor or dependent children live apart from one another, the minor or dependent children may receive some of the support allowance. If there is no surviving spouse, minor or dependent children become entitled to the homestead exemption of $15,000 and to support allowances. The exempt property section confers rights on the spouse, if any, or on all children, to $10,000 in certain chattels, or funds if the unencumbered value of chattels is below the $10,000 level. This provision is designed in part to relieve a personal representative of the duty to sell household chattels when there are children who will have them.
    </p>
    <p>
     These family protection provisions supply the basis for the important small estate provisions of Article III, Part 12 [N.D.C.C. §
   ch. 30.1-23].
    </p>
    <p>
     States adopting the Code may see fit to alter the dollar amounts suggested in these sections, or to vary the terms and conditions in other ways so as to accommodate existing traditions. Although creditors of estates would be aided somewhat if all family exemption provisions relating to probate estates were the same throughout the country, there is probably less need for uniformity of law regarding these provisions than for any of the other parts of this article. Still, it is quite important for all states to limit their homestead, support allowance and exempt property provisions, if any, so that they apply only to estates of decedents who were domiciliaries of the state.
    </p>
    <p>
     Notice that under Section 2-104 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-04] a spouse or child claiming under this Part must survive the decedent by 120 hours.

      This chapter applies to the estate of a decedent who dies domiciled in this state. The rights to homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance for a decedent who dies not domiciled in this state are governed by the law of the decedent’s domicile at death.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the homestead defined in section 47-18-01, the decedent’s surviving spouse is entitled from the estate to a value, not exceeding fifteen thousand dollars in excess of any security interests therein, in household furniture, automobiles, furnishings, appliances, and personal effects. If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent’s minor children, whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by the decedent, are entitled jointly to the same value. If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than fifteen thousand dollars, or if there is not fifteen thousand dollars worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or such children are entitled to other assets of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the fifteen thousand dollar value. Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, but the right to any assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier payment of the homestead allowance and family allowance. These rights are in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the decedent’s will, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective share.

       As originally adopted in 1969, the dollar amount exempted was set at $3,500. To adjust for inflation, the amount was increased to $10,000 in 1990 and to $15,000 in 2008. The dollar amount in this section is subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments under Section 1-109 [not adopted by North Dakota].
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike the exempt amount described in Sections 2-402 [not adopted by North Dakota; reference is made to the homestead exemption of N.D.C.C. §
   47-18-01] and 2-404 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-07-02], the exempt amount described in this section is available in a case in which the decedent left no spouse but left only adult children. The provision in this section that establishes priorities is required because of possible difference between beneficiaries of the exemptions described in this section and those described in Sections 2-402 and 2-404.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-204 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-02(2)(a)] covers waiver of exempt property rights. This section indicates that a decedent’s will may put a spouse to an election with reference to exemptions, but that no election is presumed to be required.

       In addition to the right to homestead allowance and exempt property, the decedent’s surviving spouse and minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by the decedent are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the estate for their maintenance during the period of administration, which allowance may not continue for longer than one year if the estate is inadequate to discharge allowed claims. The allowance may be paid as a lump sum or in periodic installments. It is payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children; otherwise to the children, or persons having their care and custody. If a minor child or dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be made partially to the child or the child’s guardian or other person having the child’s care and custody, and partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear. The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims except the homestead allowance.

       The family allowance is not chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the will of the decedent, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession or by way of elective share. The death of any person entitled to family allowance terminates the right to allowances not yet paid.

      <p>
       The allowance provided by this section does not qualify for the marital deduction under the federal estate tax because the interest is a non-deductible terminable interest. A broad code must be drafted to provide the best possible protection for the family in all cases, even though this may not provide desired tax advantages for certain larger estates. In the estates falling in the federal estate tax bracket where careful planning may be expected, it is important to the operation of formula clauses that the family allowance be clearly deductible or clearly non-deductible. With the section clearly creating a non-deductible interest, estate planners can create a plan that will operate with certainty. Finally, in order to facilitate administration of this allowance without Court supervision it is necessary to provide a fairly simple and definite framework.
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the amount of the family allowance, account should be taken of both the previous standard of living and the nature of other resources available to the family to meet current living expenses until the estate can be administered and assets distributed. While the death of the principal income producer may necessitate some change in the standard of living, there must also be a period of adjustment. If the surviving spouse has a substantial income, this may be taken into account. Whether life insurance proceeds payable in a lump sum or periodic installments were intended by the decedent to be used for the period of adjustment or to be conserved as capital may be considered. A living trust may provide the needed income without resorting to the probate estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously, need is relative to the circumstances, and what is reasonable must be decided on the basis of the facts of each individual case. Note, however, that under the next section the personal representative may not determine an allowance of more that $1500 per month for one year; a Court Order would be necessary if a greater allowance is reasonably necessary.

       If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised may not be used to satisfy rights to exempt property. Subject to this restriction, the surviving spouse, guardians of minor children, or children who are adults may select property of the estate as exempt property. The personal representative may make those selections if the surviving spouse, the children, or the guardians of the minor children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time, or there is no guardian of a minor child. The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of distribution to establish the ownership of property taken as exempt property.

        Scope and Purpose of 1990 Revision.
       </b>
       As originally adopted in 1969, the maximum family allowance the personal representative was authorized to determine without court order was a lump sum of $6,000 or periodic installments of $500 per month for one year. To adjust for inflation, the amounts were increased in 1990 to $18,000 and $1,500 respectively and in 2008 to $22,500 and $2,250. The dollar amount in this section is subject to annual cost-of-living adjustments under Section 1-109 [not adopted by North Dakota].
      </p>
      <p>
       A new subsection (b) [subsection (2)] was added to provide for the case where the right to an elective share is exercised on behalf of a surviving spouse who is an incapacitated person. In that case, the personal representative is authorized to add any unexpended portions under the homestead allowance, exempt property, and family allowance to the custodial trust established by Section 2-212(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-06(2)].

      General Editorial Board Comment.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 5 of Article II is retitled [as Wills, Will Contracts, and Custody and Deposit of Wills] to reflect the fact that it now includes the provisions on will contracts (pre-1990 section 2-701) and on custody and deposit of wills (pre-1990 sections 2-901 and 2-902).
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 5 deals with capacity and formalities for execution and revocation of wills. The basic intent of the pre-1990 sections was to validate wills whenever possible. To that end, the minimum age for making wills was lowered to eighteen, formalities for a written and attested will were reduced, holographic wills written and signed by the testator were authorized, choice of law as to validity of execution was broadened, and revocation by operation of law was limited to divorce or annulment. In addition, the statute also provided for an optional method of execution with acknowledgment before a public officer (the self-proved will).
    </p>
    <p>
     These measures have been retained, and the purpose of validating wills whenever possible has been strengthened by the addition of a new section, section 2-503 [not adopted by North Dakota], which allows a will to be upheld despite a harmless error in it execution.

       </h5>
       <p>
        To defeat a will on the ground that the testator lacked soundness of mind due to an insane delusion, it must be established that the testator was possessed of a delusion that had no basis in fact or probability and was wholly the product of the imagination, that the will was the product of that delusion, and that the testator devised his property in a way, except for that delusion, he would not have done.

        Elements necessary to invalidate a will on the basis of undue influence are that the testator was subject to such influence, the opportunity to exercise it existed, there was a disposition to exercise it, and that the result appears to be the effect of such influence; to be undue, the influence must operate at the time the will is made and must dominate and control the making of the will so as to make the will express the purpose and intent of the person exercising the influence and not the purpose and intent of the testator.

        Subsection (a) [Subsection (1)]: Witnessed or Notarized Wills.
       </b>
       Three formalities for execution of a witnessed or notarized will are imposed. Subsection (a)(1) [Subsection (1)(a)] requires the will to be in writing. Any reasonably permanent record is sufficient. See Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 3.1 cmt. i (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (a)(2) [Subsection (1)(b)], the testator must sign the will or some other individual must sign the testator’s name in the testator’s presence and by the testator’s direction. If the latter procedure is followed, and someone else signs the testator’s name, the so-called “conscious presence” test is codified, under which a signing is sufficient if it was done in the testator’s conscious presence, i.e., within the range of the testator’s senses such as hearing; the signing need not have occurred within the testator’s line of sight. For application of the “conscious-presence” test, see Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 3.1 cmt. n (1999); Cunningham v. Cunningham, 83 N.W. 58 (Minn. 1900) (conscious-presence requirement held satisfied where “the signing was within the sound of the testator’s voice; he knew what was being done ...”); Healy v. Bartless, 59 A. 617 (N.H. 1904) (individuals are in the decedent’s conscious presence “whenever they are so near at hand that he is conscious of where they are and of what they are doing, through any of his senses, and where he can readily see them if he is so disposed.”); Demaris’ Estate, 110 P.2d 571 (Or. 1941) (“[W]e do not believe that sight is the only test of presence. We are convinced that any of the senses that a testator possesses, which enable him to know whether another is near at hand and what he is doing, may be employed by him in determining whether [an individual is] in his [conscious] presence ...”).
      </p>
      <p>
       Signing may be by mark, nickname, or initials, subject to the general rules relating to that which constitutes a “signature.” See Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 3.1 cmt. j (1999). There is no requirement that the testator “publish” the document as his or her will, or that he or she request the witnesses to sign, or that the witnesses sign in the presence of the testator or of each other. The testator may sign the will outside the presence of the witnesses, if he or she later acknowledges to the witnesses that the signature is his or hers (or that his or her name was signed by another) or that the document is his or her will. An acknowledgment need not be expressly stated, but can be inferred from the testator’s conduct. Norton v. Georgia Railroad Bank &amp; Tr. Co., 285 S.E.2d 910 (Ga. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no requirement that the testator’s signature be at the end of the will; thus, if the testator writes his or her name in the body of the will and intends it to be his or her signature, the statute is satisfied. See Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 3.1 cmts. j &amp; k (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(3) [Subsection (1)(c)] requires that the will either be (A) signed by at least two individuals, each of whom witnessed at least one of the following: (i) the signing of the will; (ii) the testator’s acknowledgment of the signature; or (iii) the testator’s acknowledgment of the will; or (B) acknowledged by the testator before a notary public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments. Subparagraph (B) [Subparagraph (1)(c)(2)] was added in 2008 in order to recognize the validity of notarized wills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (a)(3)(A) [subsection (1)(c)(1)], the witnesses must sign as witnesses (see, e.g., Mossler v. Johnson, 565 S.W.2d 952 (Tex. Civ.App. 1978)), and must sign within a reasonable time after having witnessed the testator’s act of signing or acknowledgment. There is, however, no requirement that the witnesses sign before the testator’s death. In a particular case, the reasonable-time requirement could be satisfied even if the witnesses sign after the testator’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (a)(3)(B) [subsection (1)(c)(2)], a will, whether or not it is properly witnessed under subsection (a)(3)(A) [subsection (1)(c)(1)], can be acknowledged by the testator before a notary public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments. Note that a signature guarantee is not an acknowledgment before a notary public or other person authorized by law to take acknowledgments. The signature guarantee program, which is regulated by federal law, is designed to facilitate transactions relating to securities. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.17Ad-15.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing notarized wills as an optional method of execution addresses cases that have begun to emerge in which the supervising attorney, with the client and all witnesses present, circulates one or more estate-planning documents for signature, and fails to notice that the client or one of the witnesses has unintentionally neglected to sign one of the documents. See, e.g.,
   Dalk v. Allen, 774 So.2d 787 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2000); Sisson v. Park Street Baptist Church, 24 E.T.R.2d 18 (Ont. Gen. Div. 1998). This often, but not always, arises when the attorney prepares multiple estate-planning documents — a will, a durable power of attorney, a health-care power of attorney, and perhaps a revocable trust. It is common practice, and sometimes required by state law, that the documents other than the will be notarized. It would reduce confusion and chance for error if all of these documents could be executed with the same formality.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, lay people (and, sad to say, some lawyers) think that a will is valid if notarized, which is not true under non-UPC law. See, e.g., Estate of Saueressig, 136 P.3d 201 (Cal. 2006). In Estate of Hall, 51 P.3d 1134 (Mont. 2002), a notarized but otherwise unwitnessed will was upheld, but not under the pre-2008 version of Section 2-502 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-02], which did not authorize notarized wills. The will was upheld under the harmless-error rule of Section 2-503 [not adopted by North Dakota]. There are also cases in which a testator went to his or her bank to get the will executed, and the bank’s notary notarized the document, mistakenly thinking that notarization made the will valid. Cf., e.g., Orrell v. Cochran, 695 S.W.2d 552 (Tex. 1985). Under non-UPC law, the will is usually held invalid in such cases, despite the lack of evidence raising any doubt that the will truly represented the decedent’s wishes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other uniform acts affecting property or person do not require either attesting witnesses or notarization. See, e.g., Uniform Trust Code § 402(a)(2); Power of Attorney Act § 105; Uniform Health-Care Decisions Act § 2(f).
      </p>
      <p>
       A will that does not meet the requirements of subsection (a) may be valid under subsection (b) as a holograph or under the harmless-error rule of Section 2-503 [not adopted by North Dakota].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b): Holographic Wills [Subsection (2)].
       </b>
       This subsection authorizes holographic wills. On holographic wills, see Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 3.2 (1999). Subsection (b) enables a testator to write his or her own will in handwriting. There need be no witnesses. The only requirement is that the signature and the material portions of the document be in the testator’s handwriting.
      </p>
      <p>
       By requiring only the “material portions of the document” to be in the testator’s handwriting (rather than requiring, as some existing statutes do, that the will be “entirely” in the decedent’s handwriting), a holograph may be valid even though immaterial parts such as date or introductory wording are printed, typed, or stamped.
      </p>
      <p>
       A valid holograph can also be executed on a printed will form if the material portions of the document are handwritten. The fact, for example, that the will form contains printed language such as “I give, devise, and bequeath to _______” does not disqualify the document as a holographic will, as long as the testator fills out the remaining portion of the dispositive provision in his or her own hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c): Extrinsic Evidence [Subsection (3)].
       </b>
       Under subsection (c) [subsection (3)], testamentary intent can be shown by extrinsic evidence, including for holographic wills the printed, typed, or stamped portions of the form or document. Handwritten alterations, if signed, of a validly executed nonhandwritten will can operate as a holographic codicil to the will. If necessary, the handwritten codicil can derive meaning, and hence validity as a holographic codicil, from nonhandwritten portions of the document. See Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 3.2 cmt. g (1999). This position intentionally contradicts Estate of Foxley, 575 N.W.2d 150 (Neb. 1998), a decision condemned in Reporter’s Note No. 4 to the Restatement as a decision that “reached a manifestly unjust result”.

        This section is not applicable to an instrument attempting to be established as a will where the execution and death of the maker of the instrument occur prior to the effective date of this section. Kuhn v. Kuhn, 281 N.W.2d 230, 1979 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 270</cite> (N.D. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was no error to probate a decedent’s will because the decedent signed the will in the presence of two witnesses, who signed the will in the decedent’s presence, and all three signatures were notarized. Nordahl v. Jensen (In re Estate of Blikre), 2019 ND 257, 934 N.W.2d 867, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 267</cite> (N.D. 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was no error to deny probate of a decedent’s alleged holographic will because the decedent’s handwritten documents were not such a will, as the documents (1) lacked testamentary intent, (2) did not specify whether items were to be distributed between sisters and nieces, (3) did not explicitly devise anything to anyone, and (4) were not signed by the decedent. Nordahl v. Jensen (In re Estate of Blikre), 2019 ND 257, 934 N.W.2d 867, 2019 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 267</cite> (N.D. 2019).

        Recitals in an attestation clause of a will are presumed to be true and can be used to establish due execution, unless the presumption of truth is overcome by clear and convincing evidence. In re Estate of Stanton, 472 N.W.2d 741, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1991) (decided under former section 56-03-02).

        The presumption of due execution created by the attestation clause of the will offered for probate must be overcome by clear and convincing evidence for individual challenging the will to prevail.

       </h5>
       <p>
        District court did not err in determining appellant will proponent presented evidence strong enough to establish a prima facie case of due execution of decedent’s will in accordance with the requirements of N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-02, because the court relied upon the notes of the deceased attorney who drafted the will, the deposition testimony of the attorney’s secretary, and the testimony of a witness who saw the signed will.
   In re Estate of Clemetson v. Evanson, 2012 ND 28, 812 N.W.2d 388, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 25</cite> (N.D. 2012).

        Burden of Proof.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of proof was on one who offered a will for probate to establish execution of will in manner prescribed by statute. Stormon v. Weiss, 65 N.W.2d 475, 1954 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 94</cite> (N.D. 1954).

       <b>
        Compliance with Statutory Requirements.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Testamentary disposition of property of decedent was subject absolutely to control of governing statute, and failure to comply with statutory mandate concerning execution of a will was fatal to its validity. McKee v. Buck, 72 N.D. 86, 4 N.W.2d 652, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1942); Knudsen v. Lyons, 79 N.D. 595, 58 N.W.2d 845 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       Written instrument which made a testamentary disposition of real property that was not entirely written, dated, and signed by hand of purported testator had to be executed and attested in manner prescribed by former section. Johnson v. Weldy, 79 N.D. 80, 54 N.W.2d 829, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 100</cite> (N.D. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       A testator had to comply with all the formalities required by statute in the execution and attesting of a will or the will was not valid. In re Baur's Estate, 79 N.D. 113, 54 N.W.2d 891, 1952 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       No will was valid unless executed according to the provisions of the laws of North Dakota or according to the law of the place in which it was made, or in which the testator at the time was domiciled. Knudsen v. Lyons, 79 N.D. 595, 58 N.W.2d 845 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Date.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Instrument sought to be probated as a holographic will had to be dated by testator himself. Montague v. Street, 59 N.D. 618, 231 N.W. 728, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       A holographic will was not dated as required by former statute, unless it showed the day, month, and year when executed. Montague v. Street, 59 N.D. 618, 231 N.W. 728, 1930 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 181</cite> (N.D. 1930).

      <p>
       <b>
        Defective Petition to Probate.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A petition to probate a will was fatally defective where it failed to show that document presented had been executed and subscribed by testator himself or some person in his presence and by his direction. Knudsen v. Lyons, 79 N.D. 595, 58 N.W.2d 845 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Jury Question.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not will was witnessed in the presence of testatrix was jury question. Ostlund v. Ecklund, 45 N.D. 76, 176 N.W. 350, 1920 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D. 1920).

       <b>
        Mark As Signature.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A mark made by one intending by making it to execute a will, witnessed as provided in former statute, was sufficient to comply with requirements of statute. McKee v. Buck, 72 N.D. 86, 4 N.W.2d 652, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1942); Whelan v. Burris, 72 N.W.2d 884, 1955 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 147</cite> (N.D. 1955).

      <p>
       <b>
        Place of Residence.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Former law requiring a witness to write his place of residence with his name was directory, and failure of witness to write his place of residence did not invalidate a will that had been otherwise validly executed and attested. Hutchinson v. Charles, 75 N.W.2d 313 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The validity of the execution of a will was not dependent upon the former requirement that each witness write with his name his place of residence when the will had already been otherwise validly executed and attested. Hutchinson v. Charles, 75 N.W.2d 313 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Proper Execution.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a will was subscribed in presence of attesting witnesses or acknowledged by testator to them to have been made by him or by his authority, testator at time declaring to attesting witnesses that instrument was his will and witnesses signing in his presence and at his request, it was properly executed under former section. Ouren v. Friswold, 55 N.D. 664, 215 N.W. 160, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 151</cite> (N.D. 1927).

      <p>
       <b>
        Subscribing Testator’s Name.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Person subscribing testator’s name to a will, who also signed as an attesting witness, was not required to state on instrument that he wrote testator’s name, since such fact could be shown on proof of the signature. In re Starke's Estate, 67 N.D. 178, 271 N.W. 131, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where name of testator was subscribed to will by another person as prescribed by former statute, signature to the will was sufficient. In re Starke's Estate, 67 N.D. 178, 271 N.W. 131, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 72</cite> (N.D. 1937).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where testator subscribed will in the presence of one attesting witness and acknowledged to other attesting witness that he signed will, attestation was sufficient. Collins v. Stroup, 71 N.D. 679, 3 N.W.2d 742, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1942).
      </p>
      <p>
       An attesting witness need not have been present when testator subscribed his name to a will. Collins v. Stroup, 71 N.D. 679, 3 N.W.2d 742, 1942 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 103</cite> (N.D. 1942).

       A self-proved will may be admitted to probate as provided in Sections 3-303 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-14-03], 3-405 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-15-05], and 3-406 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-15-06] without the testimony of any attesting witness, but otherwise it is treated no differently from a will not self proved. Thus, a self-proved will may be contested (except in regard to questions of proper execution), revoked, or amended by a codicil in exactly the same fashion as a will not self proved. The procedural advantage of a self-proved will is limited to formal testacy proceedings because Section 3-303 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-14-03], which deals with informal probate, dispenses with the necessity of testimony of witnesses even though the instrument is not self proved under this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) [Subsection (3)] was added in 1990 to counteract an unfortunate judicial interpretation of similar self-proving will provisions in a few states, under which a signature on the self-proving affidavit was held not to constitute a signature on the will, resulting in invalidity of the will in cases in which the testator or witnesses got confused and only signed on the self-proving affidavit. See Mann, Self-proving Affidavits and Formalism in Wills Adjudication, 63 Wash. U. L.Q. 39 (1985); Estate of Ricketts, 773 P.2d 93 (Wash.Ct.App.1989).

       Section 2-502(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-02(1)] was amended in 2008 to add an optional method of execution by having a will notarized rather than witnessed by two attesting witnesses. The amendment to Section 2-502 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-02] necessitated amending this section so that it only applies to a will that is executed with attesting witnesses.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section carries forward the position of the pre-1990 Code. The position adopted simplifies the law relating to interested witnesses. Interest no longer disqualifies a person as a witness, nor does it invalidate or forfeit a gift under the will. Of course, the purpose of this change is not to foster use of interested witnesses, and attorneys will continue to use disinterested witnesses in execution of wills. But the rare and innocent use of a member of the testator’s family on a home-drawn will is not penalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       This approach does not increase appreciably the opportunity for fraud or undue influence. A substantial devise by will to a person who is one of the witnesses to the execution of the will is itself a suspicious circumstance, and the device might be challenged on grounds of undue influence. The requirement of disinterested witnesses has not succeeded in preventing fraud and undue influence; and in most cases of undue influence, the influencer is careful not to sign as a witness, but to procure disinterested witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Section 3-406 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-15-06], an interested witness is competent to testify to prove execution of the will.

       This section permits probate of wills in this state under certain conditions even if they are not executed in accordance with the formalities of Section 2-502 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-02] or 2-503 [not adopted by North Dakota]. Such wills must be in writing but otherwise are valid if they meet the requirements for execution of the law of the place where the will is executed (when it is executed in another state or country) or the law of testator’s domicile, abode or nationality at either the time of execution or at the time of death. Thus, if testator is domiciled in state 1 and executes a typed will merely by signing it without witnesses in state 2 while on vacation there, the Court of this State would recognize the will as valid if the law of either state 1 or state 2 permits execution by signature alone. Or, if a national of Mexico executes a written will in this state which does not meet the requirements of Section 2-502 [N.D.C.C.§
   30.1-08-02] but meets the requirements of Mexican law, the will would be recognized as validly executed under this section. The purpose of this section is to provide a wide opportunity for validation of expectations of testators.

        Revocation by Inconsistency.
       </b>
       As originally promulgated, this section provided no standard by which the Courts were to determine whether in a given case a subsequent will with no revocation clause revokes a prior will, wholly or partly, by inconsistency. Some Courts seem to have been puzzled about the standard to be applied. New subsections (b), (c), and (d) [subsections (2), (3), and (4)] codify the workable and common-sense standards set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Property (Donative Transfers) § 34.2 comment b (1991). Under these subsections, the question whether the subsequent will was intended to replace rather than supplement the previous will depends upon whether the second will makes a complete disposition of the testator’s estate. If the second will does make a complete disposition of the testator’s estate, a presumption arises that the second will was intended to replace the previous will. If the second will does not make a complete disposition of the testator’s estate, a presumption arises that the second will was intended to supplement rather than replace the previous will. The rationale is that, when the second will does not make a complete disposition of the testator’s estate, the second will is more in the nature of a codicil to the first will. This standard has been applied in the cases without the benefit of a statutory provision to this effect. E.g., Gilbert v. Gilbert, 652 S.W.2d 663 (Ky. Ct. App. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example.
       </i>
       Five years before her death, G executed a will (Will # 1), devising her antique desk to A; $20,000 to B; and the residue of her estate to C. Two years later, A died, and G executed another will (Will # 2), devising her antique desk to A’s spouse, X; $10,000 to B; and the residue of her estate to C. Will # 2 neither expressly revoked Will # 1 nor made any other reference to it. G’s net probate estate consisted of her antique desk (worth $10,000) and other property (worth $90,000). X, B, and C survived G by 120 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution.
       </i>
       Will # 2 was presumptively intended by G to replace Will # 1 because Will # 2 made a complete disposition of G’s estate. Unless this presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, Will # 1 is wholly revoked; only Will # 2 is operative on G’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       If however, Will #2 had not contained a residuary clause, and hence had not made a complete disposition of G’s estate, “Will #2” is more in the nature of a codicil to Will #1, and solution would be different. Now, Will #2 would presumptively be treated as having been intended to supplement rather than replace Will #1. In the absence of evidence clearly and convincingly rebutting this presumption, Will #1 would be revoked only to the extent Will #2 is consistent with it; both wills would be operative on G’s death, to the extent they are not inconsistent. As to the devise of the antique desk, Will # 2 is inconsistent with Will # 1, and the antique desk would go to X. There being no residuary clause in Will # 2, there is nothing in Will # 2 that is inconsistent with the residuary clause in Will # 1, and so the residue would go to C. The more difficult question relates to the cash devises in the two wills. The question whether they are inconsistent with one another is a question of interpretation in the individual case. Section 2-507 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-07] does not establish a presumption one way or the other on that question. If the Court finds that the cash devises are inconsistent with one another, i.e., if the Court finds that the cash devise in Will # 2 was intended to replace rather than supplement the cash devise in Will # 1, then B takes $10,000. But if the Court finds that the cash devises are not inconsistent with one another, B would take $30,000.

        Revocatory Act.
       </b>
       In the case of an act of revocation done to the document, subsection (a)(2) [subsection (1)(b)] is revised to provide that a burning, tearing, or canceling is a sufficient revocatory act even though the act does not touch any of the words on the will. This is consistent with cases on burning or tearing (e.g., White v.Casten, 46 N.C. 197 (1853) (burning); Crampton v.Osburn, 356 Mo. 125, 201 S.W.2d 336 (1947) (tearing)), but inconsistent with most, but not all, cases on cancellation (e.g., Yont v. Eads, 317 Mass. 232, 57 N.E.2d 531 (1944); Kronauge v. Stoecklein, 33 Ohio App.2d 229, 293 N.E.2d 320 (1972); Thompson v. Royall, 163 Va. 492, 175 S.E. 748 (1934); contra, Warner v. Warner’s Estate, 37 Vt. 356 (1864)). By substantial authority, it is held that removal of the testator’s signature—by, for example, lining it through, erasing or obliterating it, tearing or cutting it out of the document, or removing the entire signature page—constitutes a sufficient revocatory act to revoke the entire will. Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Calhoun, 514 So.2d 895 (Ala.1987) and cases cited therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(2) [subsection (1)(b)] is also revised to codify the “conscious-presence” test. As revised, subsection (a)(2) provides that, if the testator does not perform the revocatory act, but directs another to perform the act, the act is a sufficient revocatory act if the other individual performs it in the testator’s conscious presence. The act need not be performed in the testator’s line of sight. See the Comment to Section 2-502 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-02] for a discussion of the “conscious-presence” test.

       To effect a revocation, a revocatory act must be accompanied by revocatory intent. Determining whether a revocatory act was accompanied by revocatory intent may involve exploration of extrinsic evidence, including the testator’s statement as to intent.

        Dependent Relative Revocation.
       </b>
       Each Court is free to apply its own doctrine of dependent relative revocation. See generally Palmer, “Dependent Relative Revocation and Its Relation to Relief for Mistake,” 69 Mich. L. Rev. 989 (1971). Note, however, that dependent relative revocation should less often be necessary under the revised provisions of the Code. Dependent relative revocation is the law of second best, i.e., its application does not produce the result the testator actually intended, but is designed to come as close as possible to that intent. A precondition to the application of dependent relative revocation is, or should be, good evidence of the testator’s actual intention; without that, the Court has no basis for determining which of several outcomes comes the closest to that actual intention.
      </p>
      <p>
       When there is good evidence of the testator’s actual intention, however, the revised provisions of the Code would usually facilitate the effectuation of the result the testator actually intended. If, for example, the testator by revocatory act revokes a second will for the purpose of reviving a former will, the evidence necessary to establish the testator’s intent to revive the former will should be sufficient under Section 2-509 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-09] to effect a revival of the former will, making the application of dependent relative revocation as to the second will unnecessary. If, by revocatory act, the testator revokes a will in conjunction with an effort to execute a new will, the evidence necessary to establish the testator’s intention that the new will be valid should, in most cases, be sufficient under Section 2-503 [not adopted by North Dakota] to give effect to the new will, making the application of dependent relative revocation as to the old will unnecessary. If the testator lines out parts of a will or dispositive provision in conjunction with an effort to alter the will’s terms, the evidence necessary to establish the testator’s intention that the altered terms be valid should be sufficient under Section 2-503 [not adopted by North Dakota] to give effect to the will as altered, making dependent relative revocation as to the lined-out parts unnecessary.

       <p>
        District court erred in finding that the testator’s missing will was not presumed to be revoked, because while N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-07 did not speak to admitting a lost will and neither N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-14-03 nor 30.1-15-02 provided specific presumptions for admitting a missing will, the drafter’s of the Uniform Probate Code did contemplate the probate of lost wills, and the district court erroneously failed to apply the common law animo revocandi presumption that a missing will was revoked; if a will could not be found upon the death of the testator, the presumption arose that the testator revoked the missing will, and under N.D.R.Ev. 301(a), the party seeking to probate the missing will must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the testator did not destroy or revoke the missing will animo revocandi.

        Under subsection (2) (now (1)(b)) of this section, revocation can only be accomplished when a physical mutilation of the will is coupled with the intent and for the purpose of revocation.

      <p>
       Obliteration, as used in former section, was an erasure or a blotting out of words with intent and for purpose of revoking those portions of will so obliterated; drawing lines through name of devisee and alternate executor constituted obliteration. In re Estate of Bogner, 184 N.W.2d 718, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 160</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obliteration of will was presumed to have been effected by testator where will had been in his custody, and was found after his death among his personal effects, and fell within any of the statutorily prescribed modes of revocation.

        Purpose and Scope of Revisions.
       </b>
       Although a will takes effect as a revoking instrument when it is executed, it takes effect as a dispositive instrument at death. Once revoked, therefore, a will is ineffective as a dispositive instrument unless it has been revived. This section covers the standards to be applied in determining whether a will (Will # 1) that was revoked by a subsequent will (Will # 2), either expressly or by inconsistency, has been revived by the revocation of the subsequent will, i.e., whether the revocation of Will # 2 (the revoking will) revives Will # 1 (the will that Will # 2 revoked).
      </p>
      <p>
       As revised, this section is divided into three subsections. Subsections (a) and (b) [subsections (1) and (2)] cover the effect of revoking Will # 2 (the revoking will) by a revocatory act under Section 2-507(a)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-07(1)(b)]. Under subsection (a) [subsection (1)], if Will # 2 (the revoking will) wholly revoked Will # 1, the revocation of Will # 2 does not revive Will # 1 unless “it is evident from the circumstances of the revocation of [Will # 2] or from the testator’s contemporary or subsequent declarations that the testator intended [Will # 1] to take effect as executed.” This standard places the burden of persuasion on the proponent of Will # 1 to establish that the decedent’s intention was that Will # 1 is to be his or her valid will. Testimony regarding the decedent’s statements at the time he or she revokes Will # 2 or at a later date can be admitted. Indeed, all relevant evidence of intention is to be considered by the Court on this question; the open-ended statutory language is not to be undermined by translating it into discrete subsidiary elements, all of which must be met, as the Court did in Estate of Boysen, 309 N.W.2d 45 (Minn. 1981). See Langbein to Waggoner, “Reforming the Law of Gratuitous Transfers: The New Uniform Probate Code,” 55 Alb. L. Rev. 871, 885-87 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The pre-1990 version of this section did not distinguish between complete and partial revocation. Regardless of whether Will # 2 wholly or partly revoked Will # 1, the pre-1990 version presumed against revival of Will # 1 when Will # 2 was revoked by act.
      </p>
      <p>
       As revised, this section properly treats the two situations as distinguishable. The presumption against revival imposed by subsection (a) [subsection (1)] is justified because where Will # 2 wholly revoked Will # 1, the testator understood or should have understood that Will # 1 had no continuing effect. Consequently, subsection (a) properly presumes that the testator’s act of revoking Will # 2 was not accompanied by an intent to revive Will # 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [subsection (2)] establishes the opposite presumption where Will # 2 (the revoking will) revoked Will # 1 only in part. In this case, the revocation of Will # 2 revives the revoked part or parts of Will # 1 unless “it is evident from the circumstances of the revocation of [Will # 2] or from the testator’s contemporary or subsequent declarations that the testator did not intend the revoked part to take effect as executed.” This standard places the burden of persuasion on the party arguing that the revoked part or parts of Will # 1 were not revived. The justification is that where Will # 2 only partly revoked Will # 1, Will # 2 is only a codicil to Will # 1, and the testator knows (or should know) that Will # 1 does have continuing effect. Consequently, subsection (b) [subsection (2)] properly presumes that the testator’s act of revoking Will # 2 (the codicil) was accompanied by an intent to revive or reinstate the revoked parts of Will # 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) [subsection (3)] covers the effect on Will # 1 of revoking Will # 2 (the revoking will) by another, later, will (Will # 3). Will # 1 remains revoked except to the extent that Will # 3 shows an intent to have Will # 1 effective.

        Purpose and Scope of Revisions.
       </b>
       In addition to making a few stylistic changes, several substantive changes in this section are made.
      </p>
      <p>
       As revised, it has been made clear that the “trust” need not have been established (funded with a trust res) during the decedent’s lifetime, but can be established (funded with a res) by the devise itself. The pre-1990 version probably contemplated this result and reasonably could be so interpreted (because of the phrase “regardless of the existence…of the corpus of the trust”). Indeed, a few cases have expressly stated that statutory language like the pre-1990 version of this section authorizes pour-over devises to unfunded trusts. E.g., Clymer v. Mayo, 473 N.E.2d 1084 (Mass. 1985); Trosch v. Maryland Nat’l Bank, 32 Md. App. 249, 359 A.2d 564 (1976). The authority of these pronouncements is problematic, however, because the trusts in these cases were so-called “unfunded” life-insurance trusts. An unfunded life-insurance trust is not a trust without a trust res; the trust res in an unfunded life-insurance trust is the contract right to the proceeds of the life-insurance policy conferred on the trustee by virtue of naming the trustee the beneficiary of the policy. See Gordon v. Portland Trust Bank, 201 Or. 648, 271 P.2d 653 (1954) (“[T]he [trustee as the] beneficiary [of the policy] is the owner of a promise to pay the proceeds at the death of the insured…”); Gurnett v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 356 Ill. 612, 191 N.E. 250 (1934). Thus, the term “unfunded life-insurance trust” does not refer to an unfunded trust, but to a funded trust that has not received additional funding. For further indication of the problematic nature of the idea that the pre-1990 version of this section permits pour-over devises to unfunded trusts, see Estate of Daniels, 665 P.2d 594 (Colo. 1983) (pour-over devise failed; before signing the trust instrument, the decedent was advised by counsel that the “mere signing of the trust agreement would not activate it and that, before the trust could come into being, [the decedent] would have to fund it;” decedent then signed the trust agreement and returned it to counsel “to wait for further directions on it;” no further action was taken by the decedent prior to death; the decedent’s will devised the residue of her estate to the trustee of the trust, but added that the residue should go elsewhere “if the trust created by said agreement is not in effect at my death.”)
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional revisions of this section are designed to remove obstacles to carrying out the decedent’s intention that were contained in the pre-1990 version. These revisions allow the trust terms to be set forth in a written instrument executed after as well as before or concurrently with the execution of the will; require the devised property to be administered in accordance with the terms of the trust as amended after as well as before the decedent’s death, even though the decedent’s will does not so provide; and allow the decedent’s will to provide that the devise is not to lapse even if the trust is revoked or terminated before the decedent’s death.

        Revision of Uniform Testamentary Additions to Trusts Act.
       </b>
       The freestanding Uniform Testamentary Additions to Trusts Act (UTATA) was revised in 1991 in accordance with the revisions to UPC § 2-511. States that enact Section 2-511 need not enact the UTATA as revised in 1991 and should repeal the original version of UTATA if previously enacted in the state.

    Separate writing identifying devise of certain types of tangible personal property.

     <p>
      Whether or not the provisions relating to holographic wills apply, a will may refer to a written statement or list to dispose of items of tangible personal property not otherwise specifically disposed of by the will, other than money. To be admissible under this section as evidence of the intended disposition, the writing must be signed by the testator and must describe the items and the devisees with reasonable certainty. The writing may be referred to as one to be in existence at the time of the testator’s death, it may be prepared before or after the execution of the will, it may be altered by the testator after its preparation, and it may be a writing that has no significance apart from its effect on the dispositions made by the will.

       <b>
        Purpose and Scope of Revision.
       </b>
       As part of the broader policy of effectuating a testator’s intent and of relaxing formalities of execution, this section permits a testator to refer in his or her will to a separate document disposing of tangible personalty other than money. The pre-1990 version precluded the disposition of “evidences of indebtedness, documents of title, and securities, and property used in a trade or business.” These limitations are deleted in the revised version, partly to remove a source of confusion in the pre-1990 version, which arose because evidences of indebtedness, documents of title, and securities are not items of tangible personal property to begin with, and partly to permit the disposition of a broader range of items of tangible personal property.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language “items of tangible personal property” does not require that the separate document specifically itemize each item of tangible personal property covered. The only requirement is that the document describe the items covered “with reasonable certainty.” Consequently, a document referring to “all my tangible personal property other than money” or to “all my tangible personal property located in my office” or using similar catch-all type of language would normally be sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       The separate document disposing of an item or items of tangible personal property may be prepared after execution of the will, so would not come within Section 2-510 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-10] on incorporation by reference. It may even be altered from time to time. The only requirement is that the document be signed by the testator. The pre-1990 version of this section gave effect to an unsigned document if it was in the testator’s handwriting. The revisions remove the language giving effect to such an unsigned document. The purpose is to prevent a mere handwritten draft from becoming effective without sufficient indication that the testator intended it to be effective. The signature requirement is designed to prevent mere drafts from becoming effective against the testator’s wishes. An unsigned document could still be given effect under Section 2-503 [not adopted by North Dakota], however, if the proponent could carry the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the testator intended the document to be effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The typical case covered by this section would be a list of personal effects and the persons whom the decedent desired to take specified items.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Sample Clause.
       </b>
       Section 2-513 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-13] might be utilized by a clause in the decedent’s will such as the following: I might leave a written statement or list disposing of items of tangible personal property. If I do and if my written statement or list is found and is identified as such by my Personal Representative no later than 30 days after the probate of this will, then my written statement or list is to be given effect to the extent authorized by law and is to take precedence over any contrary devise or devises of the same item or items of property in this will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-513 only authorizes disposition of tangible personal property “not otherwise specifically disposed of by the will.” The sample clause above is consistent with this restriction. By providing that the written statement or list takes precedence over any contrary devise in the will, a contrary devise is made conditional upon the written statement or list not contradicting it; if the written statement or list does contradict a devise in the will, the will does not otherwise specifically dispose of the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, however, the clause in the testator’s will does not provide that the written statement or list is to take precedence over any contrary devise in the will (or contain a provision having similar effect), then the written statement or list is ineffective to the extent it purports to dispose of items of property that were otherwise specifically disposed of by the will.

      </p>
      <p>
       The term “international will” connotes only that a will has been executed in conformity with this act. It does not indicate that the will was planned for implementation in more than one country, or that it relates to an estate that has or may have international implications. Thus, it will be entirely appropriate to use an “international will” whenever a will is desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference in subsection (2) to persons who derive their authority to act from federal law, including Foreign Service Regulations, anticipates that the United States will become a party to the 1973 Convention, and that Congress, pursuant to the obligation of the Convention, will enact the annexed uniform law and include therein some designation, possibly of a cadre only, of authorized persons. See the discussion under “Roles for Federal and State Law in Relation to International Will”, in the Prefatory Note, supra. If all states enact similar laws and designate all attorneys as authorized persons, the need for testators to resort to those designated by federal law may be minimal. It seems desirable, nonetheless, to associate whoever may be designated by federal law as suitable authorized persons for purposes of implementing state enactments of the uniform act. The resulting “borrowing” of those designated federally should minimize any difficulties that might arise from variances in the details of execution of international wills that may develop in the state and federal enactment process.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Explanatory Report of the 1973 Convention prepared by Mr. Jean-Pierre Plantard, Deputy Secretary-General of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) as published by the Institute in 1974, the following paragraphs that are relevant to this section appear:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Uniform Law gives no definition of the term will. The preamble of the Convention also uses the expression ‘last wills’. The material contents of the document are of little importance as the Uniform Law governs only its form. There is, therefore, nothing to prevent this form being used to register last wishes that do not involve the naming of an heir and which in some legal systems are called by a special name, such as ‘Kodizill’ in Austrian Law (ABGB § 553).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Although it is given the qualification ‘international’, the will dealt with by the Uniform Law can easily be used for a situation without any international element, for example, by a testator disposing in his own country of his assets, all of which are situated in that same country. The adjective ‘international’, therefore, only indicates what was had in mind at the time when this new will was conceived. Moreover, it would have been practically impossible to define a satisfactory sphere of application, had one intended to restrict its use to certain situations with an international element. Such an element could only be assessed by reference to several factors (nationality, residence, domicile of the testator, place where the will was drawn up, place where the assets are situated) and, moreover, these might vary considerably between when the will was drawn up and the beginning of the inheritance proceedings.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Use of the international will should, therefore, be open to all testators who decide they want to use it. Nothing should prevent it from competing with the traditional forms if it offers advantages of convenience and simplicity over the other forms and guarantees the necessary certainty.”

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section combines what appears in Articles 1 and 2 of the Annex into a single section. Except for the reference to later sections, the first sentence is identical to Article 1, section 1 of the Annex, the second sentence is identical to Article 1, section 2, and the third is identical to Article 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Plantard’s commentary that is pertinent to this section is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Uniform Law is intended to be introduced into the legal system of each Contracting State. Article 1, therefore, introduces into the internal law of each Contracting State the new, basic principle according to which the international will is valid irrespective of the country in which it was made, the nationality, domicile or residence of the testator and the place where the assets forming the estate are located.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The scope of the Uniform Law is thus defined in the first sentence. As was mentioned above, the idea behind it was to establish a new type of will, the form of which would be the same in all countries. The Law obviously does not affect the subsistence of all the other forms of will known under each national law …
      </p>
      <p>
       “Some of the provisions relating to form laid down by the Uniform Law are considered essential. Violation of these provisions is sanctioned by the invalidity of the will as an international will. These are: that the will must be made in writing, the presence of two witnesses and of the authorized person, signature by the testator and by the persons involved (witnesses and authorized person) and the prohibition of joint wills. The other formalities, such as the position of the signature and date, the delivery and form of the certificate, are laid down for reasons of convenience and uniformity but do not affect the validity of the international will.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Lastly, even when the international will is declared invalid because one of the essential provisions contained in Articles 2 to 5 has not been observed, it is not necessarily deprived of all effect. Paragraph 2 of Article 1 specifies that it may still be valid as a will of another kind, if it conforms with the requirements of the applicable national law. Thus, for example, a will written, dated and signed by the testator but handed over to an authorized person in the absence of witnesses or without the signature of the witnesses and the authorized person could quite easily be considered a valid holograph will. Similarly, an international will produced in the presence of a person who is not duly authorized might be valid as a will witnessed in accordance with Common law rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       “However, in these circumstances, one could no longer speak of an international will and the validity of the document would have to be assessed on the basis of the rules of internal law or of private international law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “A joint will cannot be drawn up in the form of an international will. This is the meaning of Article 2 of the Uniform Law which does not give an opinion as to whether this prohibition on joint wills, which exists in many legal systems, is connected with its form or its substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       “A will made in this international form by several people together in the same document would, therefore, be invalid as an international will but could possibly be valid as another kind of will, in accordance with Article 1, paragraph 2 of the Uniform Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The terminology used in Article 2 is in harmony with that used in Article 4 of The Hague Convention on the Conflicts of Laws Relating to the Form of Testamentary Dispositions.”

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The five subsections of this section correspond in content to Articles 3 through 5 of the Annex to the 1973 Convention. Article 1, section 1 makes it clear that compliance with all requirements listed in Articles 3 through 5 is necessary in order to achieve an international will. As re-organized for enactment in the United States, all mandatory requirements have been grouped in this section. Except for subsection (d) [subsection (4)], each of the sentences in the subsections corresponds exactly with a sentence in the Annex. Subsection (d), derived from Article 5, section 2 of the Annex, was re-worded for the sake of clarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Plantard’s comments on the requirements are as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Paragraph 1 of Article 3 lays down an essential condition for a will’s validity as an international will: it must be made in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Uniform Law does not explain what is meant by ‘writing’. This is a word of everyday language which, in the opinion of the Law’s authors, does not call for any definition but which covers any form of expression made by signs on a durable substance.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Paragraphs 2 and 3 show the very liberal approach of the draft.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Under paragraph 2, the will does not necessarily have to be written by the testator himself. This provision marks a moving away from the holograph will toward the other types of will: the public will or the mystic will and especially the Common law will. The latter, which is often very long, is only in exceptional cases written in the hand of the testator, who is virtually obliged to use a lawyer, in order to use the technical formulae necessary to give effect to his wishes. This is all the more so as wills frequently involve inter vivos family arrangements, and fiscal considerations play a very important part in this matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       “This provision also allows for the will of illiterate persons, or persons who, for some other reason, cannot write themselves, for example paralysed or blind persons.
      </p>
      <p>
       “According to paragraph 3 a will may be written in any language. This provision is in contrast with the rules accepted in various countries as regards public wills. It will be noted that the Uniform Law does not even require the will to be written in a language known by the testator. The latter is, therefore, quite free to choose according to whichever suits him best: it is to be expected that he will usually choose his own language but, if he thinks it is better, he will sometimes also choose the language of the place where the will is drawn up or that of the place where the will is mainly to be carried out. The important point is that he have full knowledge of the contents of his will, as is guaranteed by Articles 4 and 10.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Lastly, a will may be written by hand or by any other method. This provision is the corollary of paragraph 2. What is mainly had in mind is a typewriter, especially in the case of a will drawn up by a lawyer advising the testator.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The liberal nature of the principles set out in Article 3 calls for certain guarantees on the other hand. These are provided by the presence of three persons, already referred to in the context of Articles III and V of the Convention, that is to say, the authorised person and the two witnesses. It is evident that these three persons must all be simultaneously present with the testator during the carrying out of the formalities laid down in Articles 4 and 5.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Paragraph 1 of Article 4 requires, first of all, that the testator declare, in the presence of these persons, that the document produced by him is his will and that he knows the contents thereof. The word ‘declares’ covers any unequivocal expression of intention, by way of words as well as by gestures or signs, as, for example, in the case of a testator who is dumb. This declaration must be made on pain of the international will being invalid. This is justified by the fact that the will produced by the testator might have been materially drawn up by a person other than the testator and even, in theory, in a language which is not his own.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Paragraph 2 of the article specifies that this declaration is sufficient: the testator does not need to ‘inform’ the witnesses or the authorized person ‘of the contents of the will’. This rule makes the international will differ from the public will and brings it closer to the other types of will: the holograph will and especially the mystic will and the Common law will.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The testator can, of course, always ask for the will to be read, a precaution which can be particularly useful if the testator is unable to read himself. The paragraph under consideration does not in any way prohibit this; it only aims at ensuring respect for secrecy, if the testator should so wish. The international will can therefore be a secret will without being a closed will.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The declaration made by the testator under Article 4 is not sufficient: under Article 5, paragraph 1, he must also sign his will. However, the authors of the Uniform Law presumed that, in certain cases, the testator might already have signed the document forming his will before producing it. To require a second signature would be evidence of an exaggerated formalism and a will containing two signatures by the testator would be rather strange. That is why the same paragraph provides that, when he has already signed the will, the testator can merely acknowledge it. This acknowledgement is completely informal and is normally done by a simple declaration in the presence of the authorized person and witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Uniform Law does not explain what is meant by ‘signature’. This is once more a word drawn from everyday language, the meaning of which is usually the same in the various legal systems. The presence of the authorized person, who will necessarily be a practicing lawyer will certainly guarantee that there is a genuine signature correctly affixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Paragraph 2 was designed to give persons incapable of signing the possibility of making an international will. All they have to do is indicate their incapacity and the reason therefore to the authorized person. The authorized person must then note this declaration on the will which will then be valid, even though it has not been signed by the testator. Indication of the reason for incapacity is an additional guarantee as it can be checked. The certificate drawn up by the authorized person in the form prescribed in Article 10 again reproduces this declaration.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The authors of the Uniform Law were also conscious of the fact that in some legal systems-for example, English law-persons who are incapable of signing can name someone to sign in their place. Although this procedure is completely unknown to other systems in which a signature is exclusively personal, it was accepted that the testator can ask another person to sign in his name, if this is permitted under the law from which the authorized person derives his authority. This amounts to nothing more than giving satisfaction to the practice of certain legal systems, as the authorized person must, in any case, indicate on the will that the testator declared that he could not sign, and give the reason therefore. This indication is sufficient to make the will valid. There will, therefore simply be a signature affixed by a third person instead of that of the testator. Although there is nothing stipulating this in the Uniform Law, one can expect the authorized person to explain the source of this signature on the document, all the more so as the signature of this substitute for the testator must also appear on the other pages of the will, by virtue of Article 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       “This method over which there were some differences of opinion at the Diplomatic Conference, should not however interfere in any way with the legal systems which do not admit a signature in the name of someone else. Besides, its use is limited to the legal systems which admit it already and it is now implicitly accepted by the others when they recognize the validity of a foreign document drawn up according to this method. However, this situation can be expected to arise but rarely, as an international will made by a person who is incapable of signing it will certainly be a rare event.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Lastly, Article 5 requires that the witnesses and authorized person also sign the will there and then in the presence of the testator. By using the words ‘attest the will by signing’, when only the word ‘sign’ had been used when referring to the testator, the authors of the Uniform Law intended to make a distinction between the person acknowledging the contents of a document and those who have only to affix their signature in order to certify their participation and presence.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In conclusion, the international will will normally contain four signatures: that of the testator, that of the authorized person and those of the two witnesses. The signature of the testator might be missing: in this case, the will must contain a note made by the authorized person indicating that the testator was incapable of signing, adding his reason. All these signatures and notes must be made on pain of invalidity. Finally, if the signature of the testator is missing, the will could contain the signature of a person designated by the testator to sign in his name, in addition to the above-mentioned note made by the authorized person.”

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Plantard’s commentary about Articles 6, 7 and 8 of the Annex [supra] relate to subsections (a), (b) and (c) [subsections (1), (2) and (3)] respectively of this section. Subsections (a) and (b) [subsections (1) and (2)] are identical to Articles 6 and 7; subsection (c) [subsection (3)] is the same as Article 8 of the Annex except that the prefatory language “In the absence of any mandatory rule pertaining to the safekeeping of the will…” has been deleted because it is inappropriate for inclusion in a local statute designed for enactment by a state that has had no tradition or familiarity with mandatory rules regarding the safekeeping of the wills. Subsection (d) [subsection (4)] embodies the sense of Article 1, section 1 of the Annex which states that compliance with Articles 2 to 5 is necessary and so indicates that compliance with the remaining articles prescribing formal steps is not necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Plantard’s commentary is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The provisions of Article 6 and those of the following articles are not imposed on pain of invalidity. They are nevertheless compulsory legal provisions which can involve sanctions, for example, the professional, civil and even criminal liability of the authorized person, according to the provisions of the law from which he derives his authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The first paragraph, to guarantee a uniform presentation for international wills, simply indicates that signatures shall be placed at the end of international wills, that is, at the end of the text.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Paragraph 2 provides for the frequent case in which the will consists of several sheets. Each sheet has to be signed by the testator, to guarantee its authenticity and to avoid substitutions. The use of the word ‘signed’ seems to imply that the signature must be in the same form as that at the end of the will. However, in the legal systems which merely require that the individual sheets be paraphed, usually by means of initials, this would certainly have the same value as signature, as a signature itself could simply consist of initials.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The need for a signature on each sheet, for the purpose of authentifying each such sheet, led to the introduction of a special system for the case when the testator is incapable of signing. In this case it will generally be the authorized person who will sign each sheet in his place, unless, in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 2, the testator has designated another person to sign in his name. In this case, it will of course be this person who will sign each sheet.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Lastly, it is prescribed that the sheets shall be numbered. Although no further details are given on this subject, it will in practice be up to the authorized person to check if they have already been numbered and, if not, to number them or ask the testator to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The aim of this provision is obviously to guarantee the orderliness of the document and to avoid losses, subtractions or substitutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The date is an essential element of the will and its importance is quite clear in the case of successive wills. Paragraph 1 of Article 7 indicates that the date of the will in the case of an international will is the date on which it was signed by the authorized person, this being the last of the formalities prescribed by the Uniform Law on pain of invalidity (Article 5, paragraph 3). It is therefore, from the moment of this signature that the international will is valid.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Paragraph 2 stipulates that the date shall be noted at the end of the will by the authorized person. Although this is compulsory for the authorized person, this formality is not sanctioned by the invalidity of the will which, as is the case in many legal systems such as English, German and Austrian law, remains fully valid even if it is not dated or is wrongly dated. The date will then have to be proved by some other means. It can happen that the will has two dates, that of its drawing up and the date on which it was signed by the authorized person as a result of which it became an international will. Evidently only this last date is to be taken into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
       “During the preparatory work it had been intended to organize the safekeeping of the international will and to entrust its care to the authorized person. This plan caused serious difficulties both for the countries which do not have the notary as he is known in Civil law systems and for the countries in which wills must be deposited with a public authority, as is the case, for example, in the Federal Republic of Germany, where wills must be deposited with a Court.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The authors of the Uniform Law therefore abandoned the idea of introducing a unified system for the safekeeping of international wills. However, where a legal system already has rules on this subject, these rules of course also apply to the international will as well as to other types of will. Finally, the Washington Conference adopted, at the same time as the Convention, a resolution recommending States, in particular, to organize a system facilitating the safekeeping of international wills (see the commentary on this resolution, at the end of this Report). It should lastly be underlined that States desiring to give testators an additional guarantee as regards the international will will organize its safekeeping by providing, for example, that it shall be deposited with the authorized person or with a public officer. Complementary legislation of this kind could be admitted within the framework of paragraph 3 of Article 1 of the Convention, as was mentioned in our commentary on that article.
      </p>
      <p>
       “These considerations explain why Article 8 starts by stipulating that it only applies ‘in the absence of any mandatory rule pertaining to the safekeeping of the will’. If there happens to be such a rule in the national law from which the authorized person derives his authority this rule shall govern the safekeeping of the will. If there is no such rule, Article 8 requires the authorized person to ask the testator whether he wishes to make a declaration in this regard. In this way, the authors of the Uniform Law sought to reconcile the advantage of exact information so as to facilitate the discovery of the will after the death of the testator, on the one hand, and respect for the secrecy which the testator may want as regards the place where his will is kept, on the other hand. The testator is therefore quite free to make or not to make a declaration in this regard, but his attention is nevertheless drawn to the possibility left open to him, and particularly to the opportunity he has, if he expressly asks for it, to have the details he thinks appropriate in this regard mentioned on the certificate provided for in Article 9. It will thus be easier to find the will again at the proper time, by means of the certificate made out in three copies, one of which remains in the hands of the authorized person.”

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section embodies the content of Articles 9, 10 and 11 of the Annex with only minor, clarifying changes. Those familiar with the pre-proved will authorized by Uniform Probate Code § 2-504 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-08-04] should be comfortable with sections 5 and 6 of this act. Indeed, inclusion of these provisions in the Annex was the result of a concession by those familiar with civil law approaches to problems of execution and proof of wills, to the English speaking countries where will ceremonies are divided between those occurring as testator acts, and those occurring later when the will is probated. Further, since English and Canadian practices reduce post-mortem probate procedures down to little more than the presentation of the will to an appropriate registry and so, approach civil law customs, the concession was largely to accommodate American states where post-mortem probate procedures are very involved. Thus, the primary purpose of the certificate, which provides conclusive proof of the formal validity of the will, is to put wills executed before a civil law notary and wills executed in the American tradition on a par; with the certificate, both are good without question insofar as formal requirements are concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that Article III of the Convention binds countries becoming parties to recognize the capacity of an authorized person to act in relation to an international will, as conferred by the law of another country that is a party. This means that an international will coming into one of our states that has enacted the uniform law will be entirely good under local law, and that the certificate from abroad will provide conclusive proof of its validity.
      </p>
      <p>
       May an international will be contested? The answer is clearly affirmative as to contests based on lack of capacity, fraud, undue influence, revocation or ineffectiveness based on the contents of the will or substantive restraints on testamentary power. Contests based on failure to follow mandatory requirements of execution are not precluded because the next section provides that the certificate is conclusive only “in the absence of evidence to the contrary”. However, the Convention becomes relevant when one asks whether a probate Court may require additional proof of the genuineness of signatures by testators and witnesses. It provides:
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VI 1. The signature of the testator, of the authorized person, and of the witnesses to an international will, whether on the will or on the certificate, shall be exempt from any legalization or like formality.
      </p>
      <p>
       2. Nonetheless, the competent authorities of any Contracting Party may, if necessary, satisfy themselves as to the authenticity of the signature of the authorized person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumably, the prohibition against legalization would not preclude additional proof of genuineness if evidence tending to show forgery is introduced, but without contrary proof, the certificate proves the will.
      </p>
      <p>
       The authorized person is directed to attach the certificate to the will, and to keep a copy. The sense of “keep” intended by the draftsman is “continuously keep,” or “preserve.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If the will with attached certificate is to be retained by the authorized person or otherwise placed for safekeeping out of the possession of the testator, good practice would involve an unexecuted copy of the will that could be given to the testator for disposition or retention as he saw fit. It would seem that good practice in these cases also would involve attachment of the testator’s copy of the certificate to testator’s copy of the will. The statute is silent on this point, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Plantard’s commentary on the articles of the Annex that are pertinent to section 5, are as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “This provision specifies that the authorized person must attach to the international will a certificate drawn up in accordance with the form set out in Article 10, establishing that the Uniform Law’s provisions have been complied with. The term ‘joint au testament’ means that the certificate must be added to the will, that is, fixed thereto. The English text which uses the work ‘attach’ is perfectly clear on this point. Furthermore, it results from Article 11 that the certificate must be made out in three copies. This document, the contents of which are detailed in Article 10, is proof that the formalities required for the validity of the international will have been complied with. It also reveals the identity of the persons who participated in drawing up the document and may, in addition, contain a declaration by the testator as to the place where he intends his will to be kept. It should be stressed that the certificate is drawn up under the entire responsibility of the authorized person who is the only person to sign it.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Article 10 sets out the form for the certificate. The authorized person must abide by it, in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 itself, laying down this or a substantially similar form. This last phrase could not be taken as authorizing him to depart from this form: it only serves to allow for small changes of detail which might be useful in the interests of improving its comprehensibility or presentation, for example, the omission of the particulars marked with an asterisk indicating that they are to be completed where appropriate when in fact they do not need to be completed and thus become useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Including the form of a certificate in one of the articles of a Uniform Law is unusual. Normally these appear in the annexes to Conventions. However, in this way, the authors of the Uniform Law underlined the importance of the certificate and its contents. Moreover, the Uniform Law already forms the Annex to the Convention itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The 14 particulars indicated on the certificate are numbered. These numbers must be reproduced on each certificate, so as to facilitate its reading, especially when the reader speaks a foreign language, as they will help him to find the relevant details more easily: the name of the authorized person and the testator, addresses, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The certificate contains all the elements necessary for the identification of the authorized person, testator and witnesses. It expressly mentions all the formalities which have to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Law. Furthermore, the certificate contains all the information required for the will’s registration according to the system introduced by the Council of Europe Convention on the Establishment of a Scheme of Registration of Wills, signed at Basle on 16 May 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The authorized person must keep a copy of the certificate and deliver one to the testator. Seeing that another copy has to be attached to the will in accordance with Article 9, it may be deduced that the authorized person must make out altogether three copies of the certificate. These cannot be simple copies but have to be three signed originals. This provision is useful for a number of reasons. The fact that the testator keeps a copy of the certificate is a useful reminder for him, especially when his will is being kept by the authorized person or deposited with someone designated by national law. Moreover, discovery of the certificate among the testators’ papers will inform his heirs of the existence of a will and will enable them to find it more easily. The fact that the authorized person keeps a copy of the certificate enables him to inform the heirs as well, if necessary. Lastly, the fact that there are several copies of the certificate is a guarantee against changes being made to one of them and even, to a certain extent, against certain changes to the will itself, for example as regards its date.”

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section, which corresponds to Articles 11 and 12 of the Annex, must be read with the definition of “authorized person” in section 1, and Articles III and IV of the 1973 Convention which will become binding on all states if and when the United States joins that treaty. Articles III and IV of the Convention provide:
      </p>
      <p>
       Article III. The capacity of the authorized person to act in connection with an international will, if conferred in accordance with the law of a Contracting Party, shall be recognized in the territory of the other Contracting Parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article IV. The effectiveness of the certificate provided for in Article 10 of the Annex shall be recognized in the territories of all Contracting Parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       In effect, the state enacting this law will be recognizing certificates by authorized persons designated, not only by this state, but by the United States and other parties to the 1973 Convention. Once the identity of one making a certificate on an international will is established, the will may be proved without more, assuming the presence of the recommended form of certificate. Article IX (3) of the 1973 Convention constitutes the United States as the Depositary under the Convention, and Article II obligates each country joining the Convention to notify the Depositary Government of the persons designated by its law as authorized to act in connection with international wills. Hence, persons interested in local probate of an international will from another country will be enabled to determine from the Department of State whether the official making the certificate in which they are interested had the requisite authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this connection, it should be noted that under Article II of the Convention, each contracting country may designate its diplomatic or consular representatives abroad as authorized persons insofar as the local law does not prohibit it. Since the Uniform Act will be the law locally, and since it does not prohibit persons designated by foreign states that are parties to the Convention from acting locally in respect to international wills, there should be a considerable amount of latitude in selecting authorized persons to assist with wills and a correlative reduction in the chances of local non-recognition of an authorized person from abroad. Also, it should be noted that the Uniform Act does not restrict the persons which it constitutes as authorized persons in relation to the places where they can so function. This supports the view that local law as embodied in this statute should not be construed as restrictive in relation to local activities concerning international wills of foreign diplomatic and consular representatives who are resident here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The certificate requires the authorized person to state that the witnesses had the requisite capacity. If the authorized person derives his authority from the law of a state other than that where he is acting, it would be advisable to have the certificate identify the applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Uniform Act is silent in regard to methods of meeting local probate requirements contemplating deposit of the original will with the Court. Section 3-409 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-15-09] of the Uniform Probate Code, or its counterpart in a state that has not adopted the uniform law on the point, becomes pertinent. The last sentence of UPC 3-409 provides:
      </p>
      <p>
       A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after death, may be proved for probate in this state by a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy introduced is a true copy and that the will has become effective under the law of the other place.
      </p>
      <p>
       One final matter warrants mention. Implicit in local proof of an instrument by means of authentication provided by a foreign official, is the problem of proving the authority of the official. The traditional, exceedingly formalistic, method of accomplishing this has been through what has been known as “legalization”, a process that involves a number of certificates. The capacity of the official who authenticates the signature of the party to the document, if derived from his status as a county official, is proved by the certificate of a high county official. In turn, the county official’s status is proved by the certificate of the area’s secretary of state, whose status is established by another and so on until, ultimately, the Department of State certifies to the identity of the highest local government official in a format that will be persuasive to the receiving country’s foreign relations representative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Article VI of the 1973 Convention forbids legalization of the signature of testators and witnesses. It provides:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-08.2s30.1-08.2-06-Sourceol11">
        The signature of the testator, of the authorized person, and of the witnesses to an international will, whether on the will or on the certificate, shall be exempt from any legalization or like formality.
       </li>
       <li id="t30.1aIIc30.1-08.2s30.1-08.2-06-Sourceol12">
        Nonetheless, the competent authorities of any Contracting Party may, if necessary, satisfy themselves as to the authenticity of the signature of the authorized person.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Thus, it would appear that if the United States, as contracting party, satisfies itself that the signature of a foreign authorized person is authentic, and so indicates to those interested in local probate of the document, the local Court, though presumably able to receive and to act upon evidence to the contrary, cannot reject an international will for lack of proof. This is not to say, of course, that the authenticity of the signature of the foreign authorized person must be shown through the aid of the State Department; plainly, the point may be implied from the face of the document unless and until challenged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mr. Plantard’s commentary on this portion of the uniform law is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Article 12 states that the certificate is conclusive of the formal validity of the international will. It is therefore a kind of proof supplied in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       “This provision is only really understandable in those legal systems, like the United States, where a will can only take effect after it has been subjected to a preliminary procedure of verification (‘Probate’) designed to check on its validity. The mere presentation of the certificate should suffice to satisfy the requirements of this procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
       “However, the certificate is not always irrefutable as proof, as is indicated by the words ‘in the absence of evidence to the contrary’. If it is challenged, then the ensuing litigation will be solved in accordance with the legal procedure applicable in the Contracting State where the will and certificate are presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The principle set out in Article 13 is already implied by Article 1, as only the provisions of Articles 2 to 5 are prescribed on pain of invalidity. Besides, it is perfectly logical that the absence of or irregularities in a certificate should not affect the formal validity of the will, as the certificate is a document serving essentially for purposes of proof drawn up by the authorized person, without the testator taking any part either in drawing it up or in checking it. This provision is in perfect harmony with Article 12 which by the terms ‘in the absence of evidence to the contrary’ means that one can challenge what is stated in the certificate.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In consideration of the fact that the authorized person will be a practicing lawyer officially designated by each Contracting State, it is difficult to imagine him omitting or neglecting to draw up the certificate provided for by the national law to which he is subject. Besides, he would lay himself open to an action based on his professional and civil liability. He could even expose himself to sanctions laid down by his national law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “However, the international will subsists, even if, by some quirk, the certificate which is a means of proof but not necessarily the only one, should be missing, be incomplete or contain particulars which are manifestly erroneous. In these undoubtedly very rare circumstances, proof that the formalities prescribed on pain of invalidity have been carried out will have to be produced in accordance with the legal procedures applicable in each State which has adopted the Uniform Law.”

       Mr. Plantard’s commentary on this portion of the uniform law is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The authors of the Uniform Law did not intend to deal with the subject of the revocation of wills. There is indeed no reason why the international will should be submitted to a regime different from that of other kinds of wills. Article 14 therefore merely gives expression to this idea. Whether or not there has been revocation-for example, by a subsequent will-is to be assessed in accordance with the law of each State which has adopted the Uniform Law, by virtue of Article 14. Besides, this is a question mainly concerning rules of substance which would thus overstep the scope of the Uniform Law.”

       The subject of who should be designated to be authorized persons under the Uniform Law is discussed under the heading “Description of the Proposal” in the Prefatory Note.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first draft of the Uniform Law presented to the National Conference at its 1975 meeting in Quebec City included provision for a special new licensing procedure through which others than attorneys might become qualified. The ensuing discussion resulted in rejection of this approach in favor of the simpler approach of section 9. Among other difficulties with the special licensee approach, representatives of the State Department expressed concern about the attendant burden on the U.S. as Depositary Government, of receiving, keeping up to date, and interpreting to foreign governments the results of fifty different state licensing systems.

      The secretary of state shall establish a registry system by which authorized persons may register in a central information center, information regarding the execution of international wills, keeping that information in strictest confidence until the death of the maker and then making it available to any person desiring information about any will who presents a death certificate or other satisfactory evidence of the testator’s death to the center. Information that may be received, preserved in confidence until death, and reported as indicated is limited to the name, social security or any other individual identifying number established by law, address, and date and place of birth of the testator, and the intended place of deposit or safekeeping of the instrument pending the death of the maker. The secretary of state, at the request of the authorized person, may cause the information it receives about execution of any international will to be transmitted to the registry system of another jurisdiction as identified by the testator, if that other system adheres to rules protecting the confidentiality of the information similar to those established in this state.

       The relevance of this optional, bracketed section to the other sections constituting the uniform law concerning international wills is explained in the Prefatory Note. Also, Mr. Plantard’s observations regarding the Resolution attached to the 1973 Convention are pertinent. He writes:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Resolution adopted by the Washington Conference and annexed to its Final Act encourages States which adopt the Uniform Law to make additional provisions for the registering and safekeeping of the international will. The authors of the Uniform Law considered that it was not possible to lay down uniform rules on this subject on account of the differences in tradition and outlook, but several times, both during the preparatory work and during the final diplomatic phase, they underlined the importance of States making such provisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Resolution recommends organizing a system enabling … ‘the safekeeping, search and discovery of an international will as well as the accompanying certificate’ …
      </p>
      <p>
       “Indeed lawyers know that many wills are never carried out because the very existence of the will itself remains unknown or because the will is never found or is never produced. It would be quite possible to organize a register or index which would enable one to know after the death of a person whether he had drawn up a will. Some countries have already done something in this field, for example, Quebec, Spain, the Federal Republic of Germany, where this service is connected with the Registry of Births, Marriages and Deaths. Such a system could perfectly well be fashioned so as to ensure respect for the legitimate wish of testators to keep the very existence of their will secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Washington Conference also underlined that there is already an International Convention on this subject, namely the Council of Europe Convention on the Establishment of a Scheme of Registration of Wills, concluded at Basle on 16 May 1972, to which States which are not members of the Council of Europe may accede.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In this Convention the Contracting States simply undertake to create an internal system for registering wills. The Convention stipulates the categories of will which should be registered, in terms which include the international will. Apart from national bodies in charge of registration, the Convention also provides for the designation by each Contracting State of a national body which must remain in contact with the national bodies of other States and communicate registrations and any information asked for. The Convention specifies that registration must remain secret during the life of the testator. This system, which will come into force between a number of European States in the near future, interested the authors of the Convention, even if they do not accede to it. The last paragraph of the Resolution follows the pattern of the Basle Convention by recommending, in the interests of facilitating an international exchange of information on this matter, the designation in each State of authorities or services to handle such exchanges.
      </p>
      <p>
       “As for the organization of the safekeeping of international wills, the resolution merely underlies the importance of this, without making any specific suggestions in this regard. This problem has already been discussed in connection with Article 8 of the Uniform Law.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The Council of Europe Convention on the Establishment of a Scheme of Registration of Wills of May 16, 1972 and related documents were available to the reporter and provided the guidelines for section 10 of this Act.”

    </p>
    <p>
     Parts 6 and 7 [N.D.C.C. chs. 30.1-09 and 30.1-09.1] address a variety of construction problems that commonly occur in wills, trusts, and other types of governing instruments. All of the “rules” set forth in these parts yield to a finding of a contrary intention and are therefore rebuttable presumptions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rules of construction set forth in Part 6 apply only to wills. The rules of construction set forth in Part 7 apply to wills and other governing instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sections in Part 6 deal with such problems as death before the testator (lapse), the inclusiveness of the will as to property of the testator, effect of failure of a gift in the will, change in form of securities specifically devised, ademption by reason of fire, sale and the like, exoneration, and exercise of a power of appointment by general language in the will.

        Whether or not an ambiguity exists in a will is a question of law; the supreme court will determine for itself the correct construction of an unambiguous will. Jordan v. Anderson, 421 N.W.2d 816, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        Whether an ambiguity exists in a will is a question of law for the court to decide; a will provision is ambiguous if it can be given more than one interpretation or understood in more than one sense. Zimbelman v. Loh (In re Estate of Zimbleman), 539 N.W.2d 67, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        By ordering distribution according to payable on death (P.O.D.) designations of savings accounts, and an appropriate unequal distribution of the estate, district court properly gave effect to testator’s intent that accounts be divided equally while abiding by the law governing P.O.D. accounts. Berger v. Peterson (In re Estate of Peterson), 1997 ND 48, 561 N.W.2d 618, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 50</cite> (N.D. 1997).

       <p>
        Where language of a will is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the testator must be determined from the language of the will itself; where language used in a will in unclear, indefinite and ambiguous, extrinsic evidence is permissible to show what the testator meant by what he said, but not to show what testator intended to say. Quandee v. Skene, 321 N.W.2d 91, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A provision in a will is ambiguous when more than one interpretation may be given to the provision and it may be understood in more than one sense, and if the language of a will is ambiguous, extrinsic evidence is permissible to remove the ambiguity, however, extrinsic evidence is admissible only to show what the testator meant by what he said, not to show what he intended to say. Jordan v. Anderson, 421 N.W.2d 816, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 82</cite> (N.D. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Extrinsic evidence was properly considered to determine decedent’s intent, and evidence supported a trial court’s finding in interpreting ambiguous provision in decedent’s will; the trial court found that decedent intended the beneficiary to physically farm crop land (as opposed to leasing out land to be farmed on a sharecropping basis), and if he failed to do so, his sibling had an option to buy the land.

        The court’s purpose in construing a will is to ascertain the intention of the testator as it appears from a full and complete consideration of the will in light of the surrounding circumstances. Quandee v. Skene, 321 N.W.2d 91, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 288</cite> (N.D. 1982).

        The court’s purpose in construing a will is to ascertain the intention of the testator as it appears from a full and complete consideration of the will when read in light of the surrounding circumstances. In construing a will, each word, clause and provision should be given effect, if possible, and when the language of a will is clear and unambiguous, the intent of the testator must be determined from the language of the will itself. Schatz v. Schatz, 419 N.W.2d 903, 1988 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 54</cite> (N.D. 1988).

        When the court construes a will, its purpose is to ascertain the testator’s intent as it appears from a complete consideration of the will given the surrounding circumstances; if the language of the will is clear and unambiguous, the court determines the testator’s intent from the language of the will.

       </h5>
       <p>
        It is not essential that a testator understand the meaning of the technical clauses of a will, if the instrument is intended as a will and if it expresses the testator’s intent to distribute his property at death. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Direct evidence that the decedent fully read and understood all of the provisions of his or her will is unnecessary. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a duly executed will contains the decedent’s general instructions for its contents, testamentary intent exists. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless a duly executed will is ambiguous, the testamentary intent is derived from the will itself, not from extrinsic evidence. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where decedent had a new will drawn up in which he left the bulk of his estate to his “wife,” where a footnote appearing in the document indicated that the will was prepared in anticipation of his wedding, and where the decedent died three days before his wedding, the probate court did not err in ruling that the terms “spouse” and “wife” as used and defined in the decedent’s will were descriptive of his fiancee and did not create a condition precedent to her right to receive the devises because the will’s definition of “spouse” and references to the decedent’s fiancee as his “spouse” were descriptive terms that did not create a condition precedent; rather, the footnote evidenced the decedent’s intent that the will be operative before and after the marriage. The district court properly concluded that the fiancee was an unconditional devisee entitled to take under the decedent’s will; the fiancee’s right to the devises to her vested at the decedent’s death.

       Sole purpose of court in construing a will was to ascertain intention of testator as same appeared from a full and complete consideration of the will, when read in light of surrounding circumstances. If that intent could be ascertained and was not violative of some rule of law which existed for purpose of limiting power of testator to dispose of his property as he wished, such intent had to prevail.

        Where under language of a will there was no doubt as to intent of testator to dispose of his property, but it was shown by collateral facts and circumstances that bequest applied equally to two or more different persons, such will presented a latent ambiguity and parol or extrinsic evidence was permissible to remove such ambiguity.

        Intention of testator was not to be defeated because he merely failed to clothe his ideas in technical language, but, when ascertained, was to be implicitly obeyed, however informal, awkward, or defective language was in which it had been expressed. In re Glavkee's Estate, 76 N.D. 171, 34 N.W.2d 300, 1948 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 69</cite> (N.D. 1948).

        Provisions in a will giving and bequeathing to named brothers and sisters of testatrix “the remaining one-half of all property of which I die seized real, personal and mixed, wheresoever situated”, showed clearly that testatrix intended to pass all her property by phrase “give and bequeath” used in will.

        When testator’s primary and dominant purpose was completely expressed in trust provisions of will, independent of any provisions that were void as against statute of perpetuities, such portion expressing primary intent of testator would be held valid so as to carry out testator’s intention as far as possible.

        Purpose and Scope of Revision.
       </b>
       This section is revised to assure that, for example, a residuary clause in a will not only passes property owned at death that is not otherwise devised, even though the property was acquired by the testator after the will was executed, but also passes property acquired by a testator’s estate after his or her death. This reverses a case like Braman Estate, 435 Pa. 573, 258 A.2d 492 (1969), where the Court held that Mary’s residuary devise to her sister Ruth “or her estate,” which had passed to Ruth’s estate where Ruth predeceased Mary by about a year, could not go to Ruth’s residuary legatee. The Court held that Ruth’s will had no power to control the devolution of property acquired by Ruth’s estate after her death; such property passed, instead, by intestate succession from Ruth. This section, applied to the Braman Estate case, would mean that the property acquired by Ruth’s estate after her death would pass under her residuary clause.
      </p>
      <p>
       The added language also makes it clear that items such as bonuses awarded to an employee after his or her death pass under his or her will.

       Fact that in one paragraph of a will testator devised by specific description property that he did not own would not justify court in taking an equivalent amount from a bequest which was definitely made to another, and in saying that fact that former property was not owned by testator justified the conclusion that he intended that his valid and definite bequests should be set aside.

      <p>
       [North Dakota has retained the pre-1990 version of this section of the Uniform Probate Code and therefore the original comment has been retained here.] This section prevents lapse by death of a devisee before the testator if the devisee is a relative and leaves issue who survives the testator. A relative is one related to the testator by kinship and is limited to those who can inherit under section 30.1-04-03 (through grandparents); it does not include persons related by marriage. Issue include adopted persons and illegitimates to the extent they would inherit from the devisee; see sections 30.1-01-06 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-04s30.1-04-09" target="_self">30.1-04-09</a></cite>. Note that the section is broader than some existing anti-lapse statutes which apply only to devises to children and other descendants, but is narrower than those which apply to devises to any person. The section is expressly applicable to class gifts, thereby eliminating a frequent source of litigation. It also applies to the so-called “void” gift, where the devisee is dead at the time of execution of the will. This, though contrary to some decisions, seems justified. It still seems likely that the testator would want the issue of a person included in a class term but dead when the will is made to be treated like the issue of another member of the class who was alive at the time the will was executed but who died before the testator.
      </p>
      <p>
       The five-day survival requirement stated in section 30.1-09-01 [this section was repealed by S.L. 1993, ch. 334, §
   50] does not require issue who would be substituted for their parent by this section to survive their parent by any set period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 30.1-04-06 [this section was repealed by S.L. 1995, ch. 322, §
   26] describes the method of division when a taking by representation is directed by the Code.

      <p>
       See section 30.1-19-14 empowering the personal representative to pay an encumbrance under some circumstances; the last sentence of that section makes it clear that such payment does not increase the right of the specific devisee. The present section governs the substantive rights of the devisee. The common law rule of exoneration of the specific devise is abolished by this section, and the contrary rule is adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the rule as to exempt property, see section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-07s30.1-07-01" target="_self">30.1-07-01</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule of this section is not inconsistent with Section 2-606(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-08(2)]. If a conservator or agent for an incapacitated principal mortgages specifically devised property, Section 2-606(b) provides that the specific devisee is entitled to a pecuniary devise equal to the amount of the unpaid loan. Section 2-606(b) does not contradict this section, which provides that the specific devise passes subject to any mortgage interest existing at the date of death, without right of exoneration.

      <p>
       [North Dakota has retained the pre-1990 version of this section of the Uniform Probate Code and therefore the original comment has been retained here.] Although there is some indication that more states will adopt special legislation on powers of appointment, and this Code has therefore generally avoided any provisions relating to powers of appointment, there is great need for uniformity on the subject of exercise by a will purporting to dispose of all of the donee’s property, whether by a standard residuary clause or a general recital of property passing under the will. Although a substantial number of states have legislation to the effect that a will with a general residuary clause does manifest an intent to exercise a power, the contrary rule is stated in the present section for two reasons: 1. this is still the majority rule in the United States, and 2. most powers of appointment are created in marital deduction trusts and the donor would prefer to have the property pass under his trust instrument unless the donee affirmatively manifests an intent to exercise the power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section and section 30.1-09-03, the intent to exercise the power is effective if it is “indicated by the will.” This wording permits a Court to find the manifest intent if the language of the will interpreted in light of all the surrounding circumstances shows that the donee intended an exercise, except, of course, if the donor has conditioned exercise on an express reference to the original creating instrument. In other words, the modern liberal rule on interpretation of the donee’s will would be available.

        Scope and Purpose of Revisions.
       </b>
       In addition to minor stylistic changes, this section is revised to delete the requirement that the gift in satisfaction of a devise be made to the devisee. The purpose is to allow the testator to satisfy a devise to A by making a gift to B. Consider why this might be desirable. G’s will made a $20,000 devise to his child, A. G was a widower. Shortly before his death, G in consultation with his lawyer decided to take advantage of the $10,000 annual gift tax exclusion and sent a check for $10,000 to A and another check for $10,000 to A’s spouse, B. The checks were accompanied by a letter from G explaining that the gifts were made for tax purposes and were in lieu of the $20,000 devise to A. The removal of the phrase “to that person” from the statute allows the $20,000 devise to be fully satisfied by the gifts to A and B.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section parallels Section 2-109 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-10] on advancements and follows the same policy of requiring written evidence that lifetime gifts are to be taken into account in the distribution of an estate, whether testate or intestate. Although Courts traditionally call this “ademption by satisfaction” when a will is involved, and “advancement” when the estate is intestate, the difference in terminology is not significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some wills expressly provide for lifetime advances by a hodgepodge clause. Where the will contains no such clause, this section requires either the testator to declare in writing that the gift is in satisfaction of the devise or its value is to be deducted from the value of the devise or the devisee to acknowledge the same in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be a gift in satisfaction, the gift need not be an outright gift; it can be in the form of a will substitute, such as designating the devisee as the beneficiary of the testator’s life-insurance policy or the beneficiary of the remainder interest in a revocable inter-vivos trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [subsection (2)] on value accords with Section 2-109 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-10] and applies if, for example, property such as stock is given. If the devise is specific, a gift of the specific property to the devisee during lifetime adeems the devise by extinction rather than by satisfaction, and this section would be inapplicable. Unlike the common law of satisfaction, however, specific devises are not excluded from the rule of this section. If, for example, the testator makes a devise of a specific item of property, and subsequently makes a gift of cash or other property to the devisee, accompanied by the requisite written intent that the gift satisfies the devise, the devise is satisfied under this section even if the subject of the specific devise is still in the testator’s estate at death (and hence would not be adeemed under the doctrine of ademption by extinction).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (c) [subsection (3)] , if a devisee to whom a gift in satisfaction is made predeceases the testator and his or her descendants take under Section 2-603 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-05] or 2-604 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-06], they take the same devise as their ancestor would have taken had the ancestor survived the testator; if the devise is reduced by reason of this section as to the ancestor, it is automatically reduced as to the devisee’s descendants. In this respect, the rule in testacy differs from that in intestacy; see Section 2-109(c) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-10(3)].

      <p>
       No substantive revision of this section is made, but the section is relocated and renumbered to make room for new Part 7 [The section was moved from Part 6 to Part 5 of Article II of the Uniform Probate Code; however, North Dakota retained its former location. Part 7 is found in N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-09.1.].
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the purpose of this section to tighten the methods by which contracts concerning succession may be proved. Oral contracts not to revoke wills have given rise to much litigation in a number of states; and in many states if two persons execute a single document as their joint will, this gives rise to a presumption that the parties had contracted not to revoke the will except by consent of both.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires that either the will must set forth the material provisions of the contract, or the will must make express reference to the contract and extrinsic evidence prove the terms of the contract, or there must be a separate writing signed by the decedent evidencing the contract. Oral testimony regarding the contract is permitted if the will makes reference to the contract, but this provision of the statute is not intended to affect normal rules regarding admissibility of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not preclude recovery in quantum meruit for the value of services rendered the testator.

        In an action brought by a surviving spouse’s stepchildren challenging her inter vivos transfers of real estate to her natural child and her natural child’s husband on the grounds that it circumvented an alleged agreement between the father and stepmother for the disposition of their property upon their deaths, the father’s 1985 will clearly and unambiguously provided that his wife, the children’s stepmother, was to receive all of the rest, residue and remainder of his property if she survived him, which she did. The prior 1973 wills did not reflect an agreement by the father and his wife to treat all of the children equally upon the surviving spouse’s death; therefore, the wife became the sole owner of all of the assets of the father’s estate, other than a relatively small amount of money left to a stepdaughter of his and the stepmother acted within her rights and power in conveying assets to anyone she chose.

      General Editorial Board Comment.

    </p>
    <p>
     Part 7 contains rules of construction applicable to wills and other governing instruments, such as deeds, trusts, appointments, beneficiary designations, and so on. Like the rules of construction in Part 6 (which apply only to wills), the rules of construction in this Part yield to a finding of a contrary intention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the sections in Part 7 are revisions of sections contained in Part 6 of the pre-1990 Code. Although these sections originally applied only to wills, their restricted scope was inappropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of the sections in Part 7 are new, having been added to the Code as desirable means of carrying out common intention.

      Application to Pre-Existing Governing Instruments.
     </b>
     Under Section 8-101(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-35-01(2)], for decedents dying after the effective date of enactment, the provisions of this Code apply to governing instruments executed prior to as well as on or after the effective date of enactment. The Joint Editorial Board for the Uniform Probate Code has issued a statement concerning the constitutionality under the Contracts Clause of this feature of the Code. The statement, titled “Joint Editorial Board Statement Regarding the Constitutionality of Changes in Default Rules as Applied to Pre-Existing Documents,” can be found at 17 Am. C. Tr. &amp; Est.

      In the absence of a finding of a contrary intention, the rules of construction in this chapter control the construction of a governing instrument. The rules of construction in this chapter apply to a governing instrument of any type, except as the application of a particular section is limited by its terms to a specific type or types of provisions or governing instrument.

       The rules of construction in this Part apply to governing instruments of any type, except as the application of a particular section is limited by its terms to a specific type or types of provision or governing instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “governing instrument” is defined in Section 1-201 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-06] as “a deed, will, trust, insurance or annuity policy, account with POD designation, security registered in beneficiary form (TOD), pension, profit-sharing, retirement, or similar benefit plan, instrument creating or exercising a power of appointment or a power of attorney, or a dispositive, appointive, or nominative instrument of any similar type.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain of the sections in this Part are limited in their application to donative dispositions or governing instruments of a certain type or types. Section 2-704 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-09.1-04], for example, applies only to a governing instrument creating a power of appointment. Section 2-706 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-06] applies only to governing instruments that are “beneficiary designations,” a term defined in Section 1-201 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-06] as referring to “a governing instrument naming a beneficiary of an insurance or annuity policy, of an account with POD designation, of a security registered in beneficiary form (TOD), or of a pension, profit-sharing, retirement, or similar benefit plan, or other nonprobate transfer at death.” Section 2-707 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-07] applies only to governing instruments creating a future interest under the terms of a trust.

        Scope and Purpose of Revision.
       </b>
       This section parallels Section 2-104 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-04], which requires an heir to survive the intestate by 120 hours in order to inherit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scope of this section is expanded to cover all provisions of a governing instrument and this Code that relate to an individual surviving an event (including the death of another individual). As expanded, this section imposes the 120-hour requirement of survival in the areas covered by the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act. By 1993 technical amendment, an anomalous provision exempting securities registered under Part 3 of Article VI (Uniform TOD Security Registration Act) from the 120-hour survival requirement was eliminated. The exemption reflected a temporary concern attributable to UTODSRA’s preparation prior to discussion of inserting a 120-hour survival requirement in the freestanding Uniform Simultaneous Death Act (USDA).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of a multiple-party account such as a joint checking account registered in the name of the decedent and his or her spouse with right of survivorship, the 120-hour requirement of survivorship will not, under the facility-of-payment provision of Section 6-222(1) [30.1-31-15(1)], interfere with the surviving spouse’s ability to withdraw funds from the account during the 120-hour period following the decedent’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that subsection (d)(1) [subsection (4)(a)] provides that the 120-hour requirement of survival is inapplicable if the governing instrument “contains language dealing explicitly with simultaneous deaths or deaths in a common disaster and that language is operable under the facts of the case.” The application of this provision is illustrated by the following example.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example.
       </i>
       G died leaving a will devising her entire estate to her husband, H, adding that “in the event he dies before I do, at the same time that I do, or under circumstances as to make it doubtful who died first,” my estate is to go to my brother Melvin. H died about 38 hours after G’s death, both having died as a result of injuries sustained in an automobile accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (b) [subsection (2)], G’s estate passes under the alternative devise to Melvin because H’s failure to survive G by 120 hours means that H is deemed to have predeceased G. The language in the governing instrument does not, under subsection (d)(1) [subsection (4)(a)], nullify the provision that causes H, because of his failure to survive G by 120 hours, to be deemed to have predeceased G. Although the governing instrument does contain language dealing with simultaneous deaths, that language is not operable under the facts of the case because H did not die before G, at the same time as G, or under circumstances as to make it doubtful who died first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that subsection (d)(4) [subsection (4)(d)] provides that the 120-hour requirement of survival is inapplicable if “the application of this section to multiple governing instruments would result in an unintended failure or duplication of a disposition.” The application of this provision is illustrated by the following example.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example.
       </i>
       Pursuant to a common plan, H and W executed mutual wills with reciprocal provisions. Their intention was that a $50,000 charitable devise would be made on the death of the survivor. To that end, H’s will devised $50,000 to the charity if W predeceased him. W’s will devised $50,000 to the charity if H predeceased her. Subsequently, H and W were involved in a common accident. W survived H by 48 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Were it not for subsection (d)(4) [subsection (4)(d)], not only would the charitable devise in W’s will be effective, because H in fact predeceased W, but the charitable devise in H’s will would also be effective, because W’s failure to survive H by 120 hours would result in her being deemed to have predeceased H. Because this would result in an unintended duplication of the $50,000 devise, subsection (d)(4) [subsection (4)(d)] provides that the 120-hour requirement of survival is inapplicable. Thus, only the $50,000 charitable devise in W’s will is effective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d)(4) [subsection (4)(d)] also renders the 120-hour requirement of survival inapplicable had H and W died in circumstances in which it could not be established by clear and convincing evidence that either survived the other. In such a case, an appropriate result might be to give effect to the common plan by paying half of the intended $50,000 devise from H’s estate and half from W’s estate.

    Power of appointment — Meaning of specific reference requirement.

     <p>
      If a governing instrument creating a power of appointment expressly requires that the power be exercised by a reference, an express reference, or a specific reference, to the power or its source, it is presumed that the donor’s intention, in requiring that the donee exercise the power by making reference to the particular power or to the creating instrument, was to prevent an inadvertent exercise of the power.

      <p>
       <b>
        Rationale of New Section.
       </b>
       In the creation of powers of appointment, it has become common estate-planning practice to require that the donee of the power can exercise the power only by making reference (or express or specific reference) to it. The question of whether the donee has made a sufficiently specific reference is much litigated. The precise question often is whether a so-called blanket-exercise clause (also called a blending clause)—a clause referring to “any property over which I have a power of appointment”—constitutes a sufficient reference to a particular power to exercise that power. E.g., First National Bank v. Walker, 607 S.W.2d 469 (Tenn. 1980), and cases cited therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-704 [this section] sets forth the presumption that the donor’s purpose in imposing a reference requirement was to prevent an inadvertent exercise of the power by the donee. Under this section, mere use by the donee of a blanket-exercise clause would be ineffective to exercise the power because such a clause would not make a sufficient reference to the particular power. If, however, it could be shown that the donee had knowledge of and intended to exercise the power, the blanket-exercise clause would be sufficient to exercise the power, unless the presumption of this section is overcome. Under Section 2-701 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-01], the presumption of this section would be overcome if it could be shown that the donor’s intention was not merely to prevent an inadvertent exercise of the power but was to prevent any exercise of the power, intentional or inadvertent, that failed to identify in explicit terms the specific power or the creating instrument.

       </b>
       See Langbein &amp; Waggoner, “Reformation of Wills on the Ground of Mistake: Change of Direction in American Law?,” 130 U. Pa. L. Rev. 521, 583 n.223 (1982), suggesting that a donee’s will that omits a sufficiently specific reference to a particular power can be reformed to include the necessary reference if it can be shown by clear and convincing evidence that the omission was caused by a scrivener’s mistake. This approach is not inconsistent with Section 2-704. See Sections 2-601 (and accompanying Comment) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-03; however, North Dakota has retained an older version of this section]; 2-701 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-01]. See also Motes/Henes Trust v. Mote, 297 Ark. 380, 761 S.W.2d 938 (1988) (donee’s intended exercise given effect despite use of blanket-exercise clause); In re Strobel, 149 Ariz. 213, 717 P.2d 892 (1986) (donee’s intended exercise given effect despite defective reference to power).

      <p>
       This section facilitates a modern construction of gifts that identify the recipient by reference to a relationship to someone; usually these gifts will be class gifts. The rules of construction contained in this section are substantially consistent with the rules of construction contained in the Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers §§ 14.5 through 14.9. These sections of the Restatement apply to the treatment for class-gift purposes of an adoptee, a nonmarital child, a child of assisted reproduction, a gestational child, and a relative by marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rules set forth in this section are rules of construction, which under Section 2-701 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-01] are controlling in the absence of a finding of a contrary intention. With two exceptions, Section 2-705 [this section] invokes the rules pertaining to intestate succession as rules of construction for interpreting terms of relationship in private instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (a): Definitions [Subsection (1)].
       </b>
       With one exception, the definitions in subsection (a) [subsection (1)] rely on definitions contained in intestacy sections. The one exception is the definition of “distribution date,” which is relevant to the class-closing rules contained in subsection (g) [subsection (5)]. Distribution date is defined as the date when an immediate or postponed class gift takes effect in possession or enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b): Terms of Relationship. [Subsection (2)]
       </b>
       Subsection (b) [Subsection (2)] provides that a class gift that uses a term of relationship to identify the takers includes a child of assisted reproduction and a gestational child, and their respective descendants if appropriate to the class, in accordance with the rules for intestate succession regarding parent-child relationships. As provided in subsection (g) [subsection (5)] , inclusion of a child of assisted reproduction or a gestational child in a class is subject to the class-closing rules. See Examples 11 through 15.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [subsection (2)] also provides that, except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f) [subsection (3) and (4)], an adoptee and a child born to parents who are not married to each other, and their respective descendants if appropriate to the class, are included in class gifts and other terms of relationship in accordance with the rules for intestate succession regarding parent-child relationships. The subsection (e) [subsection (3)] exception relates to situations in which the transferor is not the genetic parent of the child. The subsection (f) [subsection (4)] exception relates to situations in which the transferor is not the adoptive parent of the adoptee. Consequently, if the transferor is the genetic or adoptive parent of the child, neither exception applies, and the class gift or other term of relationship is construed in accordance with the rules for intestate succession regarding parent-child relationships. As provided in subsection (g) [subsection (5)], inclusion of an adoptee or a child born to parents who are not married to each other in a class is subject to the class-closing rules. See Examples 9 and 10.

       <b>
        Subsection (c): Relatives by Marriage. [Subsection (2), 3rd sentence]
       </b>
       Subsection (c) provides that terms of relationship that do not differentiate relationships by blood from those by marriage, such as “uncles”, “aunts”, “nieces”, or “nephews”, are construed to exclude relatives by marriage, unless (i) [subsection (2)(a)] when the governing instrument was executed, the class was then and foreseeably would be empty or (ii) [subsection (2)(b)] the language or circumstances otherwise establish that relatives by marriage were intended to be included. The Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 14.9 adopts a similar rule of construction. As recognized in both subsection (c) and the Restatement, there are situations in which the circumstances would tend to include a relative by marriage. As provided in subsection (g) [subsection (5)], inclusion of a relative by marriage in a class is subject to the class-closing rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       One situation in which the circumstances would tend to establish an intent to include a relative by marriage is the situation in which, looking at the facts existing when the governing instrument was executed, the class was then and foreseeably would be empty unless the transferor intended to include relatives by marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 1.
       </i>
       G’s will devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income in equal shares “to G’s children who are living on each income payment date and on the death of G’s last surviving child, to distribute the trust property to G’s issue then living, such issue to take per stirpes, and if no issue of G is then living, to distribute the trust property to the X Charity.” When G executed her will, she was past the usual childbearing age, had no children of her own, and was married to a man who had four children by a previous marriage. These children had lived with G and her husband for many years, but G had never adopted them. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to conclude that when G referred to her “children” in her will she was referring to her stepchildren. Thus her stepchildren should be included in the presumptive meaning of the gift “to G’s children” and the issue of her stepchildren should be included in the presumptive meaning of the gift “to G’s issue.” If G, at the time she executed her will, had children of her own, in the absence of additional facts, G’s stepchildren should not be included in the presumptive meaning of the gift to “G’s children” or in the gift to “G’s issue.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 2.
       </i>
       G’s will devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income to G’s wife W for life, and on her death, to distribute the trust property to “my grandchildren.” W had children by a prior marriage who were G’s stepchildren. G never had any children of his own and he never adopted his stepchildren. It is reasonable to conclude that under these circumstances G meant the children of his stepchildren when his will gave the future interest under the trust to G’s “grandchildren.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 3.
       </i>
       G’s will devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income “to my daughter for life and on her death, to distribute the trust property to her children.” When G executed his will, his son had died, leaving surviving the son’s wife, G’s daughter-in-law, and two children. G had no daughter of his own. Under these circumstances, the conclusion is justified that G’s daughter-in-law is the “daughter” referred to in G’s will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another situation in which the circumstances would tend to establish an intent to include a relative by marriage is the case of reciprocal wills, as illustrated in Example 4, which is based on Martin v. Palmer, 1 S.W.3d 875 (Tex. Ct. App. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 4.
       </i>
       G’s will devised her entire estate “to my husband if he survives me, but if not, to my nieces and nephews.” G’s husband H predeceased her. H’s will devised his entire estate “to my wife if she survives me, but if not, to my nieces and nephews.” Both G and H had nieces and nephews. In these circumstances, “my nieces and nephews” is construed to include G’s nieces and nephews by marriage. Were it otherwise, the combined estates of G and H would pass only to the nieces and nephews of the spouse who happened to survive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still another situation in which the circumstances would tend to establish an intent to include a relative by marriage is a case in which an ancestor participated in raising a relative by marriage other than a stepchild.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 5.
       </i>
       G’s will devised property in trust, directing the trustee to pay the income in equal shares “to my nieces and nephews living on each income payment date until the death of the last survivor of my nieces and nephews, at which time the trust shall terminate and the trust property shall be distributed to the X Charity.” G’s wife W was deceased when G executed his will. W had one brother who predeceased her. G and W took the brother’s children, the wife’s nieces and nephews, into their home and raised them. G had one sister who predeceased him, and G and W were close to her children, G’s nieces and nephews. Under these circumstances, the conclusion is justified that the disposition “to my nieces and nephews” includes the children of W’s brother as well as the children of G’s sister.
      </p>
      <p>
       The language of the disposition may also establish an intent to include relatives by marriage, as illustrated in Examples 6, 7, and 8.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 6.
       </i>
       G’s will devised half of his estate to his wife W and half to “my children.” G had one child by a prior marriage, and W had two children by a prior marriage. G did not adopt his stepchildren. G’s relationship with his stepchildren was close, and he participated in raising them. The use of the plural “children” is a factor indicating that G intended to include his stepchildren in the class gift to his children.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 7.
       </i>
       G’s will devised the residue of his estate to “my nieces and nephews named herein before.” G’s niece by marriage was referred to in two earlier provisions as “my niece.” The previous reference to her as “my niece” indicates that G intended to include her in the residuary devise.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 8.
       </i>
       G’s will devised the residue of her estate “in twenty-five (25) separate equal shares, so that there shall be one (1) such share for each of my nieces and nephews who shall survive me, and one (1) such share for each of my nieces and nephews who shall not survive me but who shall have left a child or children surviving me.” G had 22 nieces and nephews by blood or adoption and three nieces and nephews by marriage. The reference to twenty-five nieces and nephews indicates that G intended to include her three nieces and nephews by marriage in the residuary devise.

        Subsection (d): Half Blood Relatives. [Subsection (2), 2nd sentence]
       </b>
       In providing that terms of relationship that do not differentiate relationships by the half blood from those by the whole blood, such as “brothers”, “sisters”, “nieces”, or “nephews”, are construed to include both types of relationships, subsection (d) is consistent with the rules for intestate succession regarding parent-child relationships. See Section 2-107 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-07] and the phrase “or either of them” in Section 2-103(3) and (4) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-03(3) an (4)]. As provided in subsection (g) [subsection (5)], inclusion of a half blood relative in a class is subject to the class-closing rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (e): Transferor Not Genetic Parent. [Subsection (3)]
       </b>
       The general theory of subsection (e) [subsection (3)] is that a transferor who is not the genetic parent of a child would want the child to be included in a class gift as a child of the genetic parent only if the genetic parent (or one or more of the specified relatives of the child’s genetic parent functioned as a parent of the child before the child reached the age of [18]. As provided in subsection (g) [subsection (5)], inclusion of a genetic child in a class is subject to the class-closing rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 9.
       </i>
       G’s will created a trust, income to G’s son, A, for life, remainder in corpus to A’s descendants who survive A, by representation. A fathered a child, X; A and X’s mother, D, never married each other, and A never functioned as a parent of the child, nor did any of A’s relatives or spouses or surviving spouses of any of A’s relatives. D later married E; D and E raised X as a member of their household. Because neither A nor any of A’s specified relatives ever functioned as a parent of X, X would not be included as a member of the class of A’s descendants who take the corpus of G’s trust on A’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, however, A executed a will containing a devise to his children or designated his children as beneficiary of his life insurance policy, X would be included in the class. Under Section 2-117 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-16], X would be A’s child for purposes of intestate succession. Subsection (c) [subsection (2), 3rd sentence] is inapplicable because the transferor, A, is the genetic parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (f): Transferor Not Adoptive Parent. [subsection (4)]
       </b>
       The general theory of subsection (f) is that a transferor who is not the adoptive parent of an adoptee would want the child to be included in a class gift as a child of the adoptive parent only if (i) the adoption took place before the adoptee reached the age of [18]; (ii) the adoptive parent was the adoptee’s stepparent or foster parent; or (iii) the adoptive parent functioned as a parent of the adoptee before the adoptee reached the age of [18]. As provided in subsection (g), inclusion of an adoptee in a class is subject to the class-closing rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 10.
       </i>
       G’s will created a trust, income to G’s daughter, A, for life, remainder in corpus to A’s descendants who survive A, by representation. A and A’s husband adopted a 47-year-old man, X. Because the adoption did not take place before X reached the age of [18], A was not X’s stepparent or foster parent, and A did not function as a parent of X before X reached the age of [18]. X would not be included as a member of the class of A’s descendants who take the corpus of G’s trust on A’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       If, however, A executed a will containing a devise to her children or designated her children as beneficiary of her life insurance policy, X would be included in the class. Under Section 2-118 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-17], X would be A’s child for purposes of intestate succession. Subsection (d) [subsection (2), 2nd sentence] is inapplicable because the transferor, A, is an adoptive parent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g): Class-Closing Rules [Subsection (5)].
       </b>
       In order for an individual to be a taker under a class gift that uses a term of relationship to identify the class members, the individual must (i) qualify as a class member under subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) [subsection (2), (3), or (4)] and (ii) not be excluded by the class-closing rules. For an exposition of the class-closing rules, see Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 15.1. Section 15.1 provides that, “unless the language or circumstances establish that the transferor had a different intention, a class gift that has not yet closed physiologically closes to future entrants on the distribution date if a beneficiary of the class gift is then entitled to distribution.”

       <b>
        Subsection (g)(1) [Subsection (5)(a)]: Child in Utero.
       </b>
       Subsection (g)(1) codifies the well-accepted rule that a child in utero at a particular time is treated as living at that time if the child lives 120 hours after birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (g)(2) [Subsection (5)(b)]: Children of Assisted Reproduction and Gestational Children; Class Gift in Which Distribution Date Arises At Deceased Parent’s Death.
       </b>
       Subsection (g)(2) changes the class-closing rules in one respect. If a child of assisted reproduction (as defined in Section 2-120 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19]) or a gestational child (as defined in Section 2-121 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-20]) is conceived posthumously, and if the distribution date arises at the deceased parent’s death, then the child is treated as living on the distribution date if the child lives 120 hours after birth and was either (i) in utero no later than 36 months after the deceased parent’s death or (ii) born no later than 45 months after the deceased parent’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 36-month period in subsection (g)(2) is designed to allow a surviving spouse or partner a period of grieving, time to make up his or her mind about whether to go forward with assisted reproduction, and a reasonable allowance for unsuccessful attempts to achieve a pregnancy. The 36-month period also coincides with Section 3-1006 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-21-06], under which an heir is allowed to recover property improperly distributed or its value from any distributee during the later of three years after the decedent’s death or one year after distribution. If the assisted-reproduction procedure is performed in a medical facility, the date when the child is in utero will ordinarily be evidenced by medical records. In some cases, however, the procedure is not performed in a medical facility, and so such evidence may be lacking. Providing an alternative of birth within 45 months is designed to provide certainty in such cases. The 45-month period is based on the 36-month period with an additional nine months tacked on to allow for a normal period of pregnancy.

G consented to be treated as the parent of the child within the meaning of § 2-120(f) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19]. G was killed in action. After G’s death, W decided to become inseminated with his frozen sperm so she could have his child. If the child so produced was either (i) in utero within 36 months after G’s death or (ii) born within 45 months after G’s death, and if the child lived 120 hours after birth, the child is treated as living at G’s death and is included in the class.

        Subsection (g)(2) [subsection (5)(b)] Inapplicable Unless Child of Assisted Reproduction or Gestational Child is Conceived Posthumously and Distribution Date Arises At Deceased Parent’s Death.
       </b>
       Subsection (g)(2) [subsection (5)(b)] only applies if a child of assisted reproduction or a gestational child is conceived posthumously and the distribution date arises at the deceased parent’s death. Subsection (g)(2) does not apply if a child of assisted reproduction or a gestational child is not conceived posthumously. It also does not apply if the 201 distribution date arises before or after the deceased parent’s death. In cases to which subsection (g)(2) does not apply, the ordinary class-closing rules apply. For purposes of the ordinary class-closing rules, subsection (g)(1) [subsection (5)(a)] provides that a child in utero at a particular time is treated as living at that time if the child lives 120 hours after birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means, for example, that, with respect to a child of assisted reproduction or a gestational child, a class gift in which the distribution date arises after the deceased parent’s death is not limited to a child who is born before or in utero at the deceased parent’s death or, in the case of posthumous conception, either (i) in utero within 36 months after the deceased parent’s death or (ii) born within 45 months after the deceased parent’s death. The ordinary class-closing rules would only exclude a child of assisted reproduction or a gestational child if the child was not yet born or in utero on the distribution date (or who was then in utero but who failed to live 120 hours after birth).
      </p>
      <p>
       A case that reached the same result that would be reached under this section is In re Martin B., 841 N.Y.S.2d 207 (Sur. Ct. 2007). In that case, two children (who were conceived posthumously and were born to a deceased father’s widow around three and five years after his death) were included in class gifts to the deceased father’s “issue” or “descendants”. The children would be included under this section because (i) the deceased father signed a record that would satisfy Section 2-120(f)(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19], (ii) the distribution dates arose after the deceased father’s death, and (iii) the children were living on the distribution dates, thus satisfying subsection (g)(1).

        Example 14.
       </i>
       G created a revocable inter vivos trust shortly before his death. The trustee was directed to pay the income to G for life, then “to pay the income to my wife, W, for life, then to distribute the trust principal by representation to my descendants who survive W.” When G died, G and W had no children. Shortly before G’s death and after being diagnosed with leukemia, G feared that he would be rendered infertile by the disease or by the treatment for the disease, so he left frozen sperm at a sperm bank. G consented to be the parent of the child within the meaning of § 2-120(f) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19]. After G’s death, W decided to become inseminated with G’s frozen sperm so that she could have his child. The child, X, was born five years after G’s death. W raised X. Upon W’s death many years later, X was a grown adult. X is entitled to receive the trust principal, because a parent-child relationship between G and X existed under § 2-120(f) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19] and X was living on the distribution date.

       The will of G’s mother created a testamentary trust, directing the trustee to pay the income to G for life, then “to pay the income by representation to G’s issue from time to time living, and at the death of G’s last surviving child, to distribute the trust principal by representation to G’s descendants who survive G’s last surviving child.” When G’s mother died, G was married but had no children. Shortly after being diagnosed with leukemia, G feared that he would be rendered infertile by the disease or by the treatment for the disease, so he left frozen sperm at a sperm bank. G consented to be the parent of the child within the meaning of § 2-120(f) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-19]. After G’s death, G’s widow decided to become inseminated with his frozen sperm so she could have his child. If the child so produced was either (i) in utero within 36 months after G’s death or (ii) born within 45 months after the G’s death, and if the child lived 120 hours after birth, the child is treated as living at G’s death and is included in the class-gift of income under the rule of convenience. If G’s widow later decides to use his frozen sperm to have another child or children, those children would be included in the class-gift of income (assuming they live 120 hours after birth) even if they were not in utero within 36 months after G’s death or born within 45 months after the G’s death. The reason is that an income interest in class-gift form is treated as creating separate class gifts in which the distribution date is the time of payment of each subsequent income payment. See Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 15.1 cmt. p. Regarding the remainder interest in principal that takes effect in possession on the death of G’s last living child, the issue of the posthumously conceived children who are then living would take the trust principal.

       For purposes of the class-closing rules, an individual who is in the process of being adopted when the class closes is treated as adopted when the class closes if the adoption is subsequently granted. An individual is “in the process of being adopted” if a legal proceeding to adopt the individual had been filed before the class closed. However, the phrase “in the process of being adopted” is not intended to be limited to the filing of a legal proceeding, but is intended to grant flexibility to find on a case by case basis that the process commenced earlier.

       Estate representative’s contention had to be rejected that the adopted woman was prohibited from inheriting from decedent, who was the mother of the adopted woman’s biological father, because the biological father did not act as the adopted woman’s father before the adopted woman turned 18-years-old, as required by
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-09.1-05(3). Although the biological father did not act as a parent towards the adopted woman between the adopted woman’s ages of three and 15-years-old, the biological father and adopted woman reconciled when the adopted woman was 15-years-old, and the trial court’s finding that the biological father then “functioned as a parent of the child” as defined under
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-14(4) was not clearly erroneous under N.D. R. Civ. P. 52(a). Kraft v. Ramos (In re Estate of Boehm), 2012 ND 104, 816 N.W.2d 793, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 93</cite> (N.D. 2012).

       <b>
        Purpose.
       </b>
       This section provides an antilapse statute for “beneficiary designations” under which the beneficiary must survive the decedent. The term “beneficiary designation” is defined in Section 1-201 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-06] as “a governing instrument naming a beneficiary of an insurance or annuity policy, of an account with POD designation, of a security registered in beneficiary form (TOD), or of a pension, profit-sharing, retirement, or similar benefit plan, or other nonprobate transfer at death”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The terms of this section parallel those of Section 2-603 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-05], except that the provisions relating to payor protection and personal liability of recipients have been added. The Comment to Section 2-603 contains an elaborate exposition of Section 2-603, together with examples illustrating its application. That Comment, in addition to the examples given below, should aid understanding of Section 2-706 [this section]. For a discussion of the reasons why Section 2-706 should not be preempted by federal law with respect to retirement plans covered by ERISA, see the Comment to Section 2-804 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-04]. See also Rayho, Note, 106 Mich. L. Rev. 373 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 1.
       </i>
       G is the owner of a life-insurance policy. When the policy was taken out, G was married to S; G and S had two young children. A and B. G died 45 years after the policy was taken out. S predeceased G, A survived G by 120 hours and B predeceased G leaving three children (X, Y, and Z) who survived G by 120 hours. G’s policy names S as the primary beneficiary of the policy, but because S predeceased G, the secondary (contingent) beneficiary designation became operative. The secondary (contingent) beneficiary designation of G’s policy states: “equally to the then living children born of the marriage of G and S”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The printed terms of G’s policy provide:
      </p>
      <p>
       “If two or more persons are designated as beneficiary, the beneficiary will be the designated person or persons who survive the Insured, and if more than one survive, they will share equally”.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       The printed clause constitutes an “alternative beneficiary designation” for purposes of subsection (b)(4), which supersedes the substitute gift to B’s descendants created by subsection (b)(2). A is entitled to all of the proceeds of the policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 2.
       </i>
       The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that G’s policy names “A and B” as secondary (contingent) beneficiaries. The printed terms of the policy provide:
      </p>
      <p>
       “If any designated Beneficiary predeceases the Insured, the interest of such Beneficiary will terminate and shall be shared equally by such of the Beneficiaries as survive the Insured”.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       The printed clause constitutes an “alternative beneficiary designation” for purposes of subsection (b)(4), which supersedes the substitute gift to B’s descendants created by subsection (b)(1). A is entitled to all of the proceeds of the policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 3.
       </i>
       The facts are the same as Examples 1 or 2, except that the printed terms of the policy do not contain either quoted clause or a similar one.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       Under Section 2-706, A would be entitled to half of the policy proceeds and X, Y, and Z would divide the other half equally.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 4.
       </i>
       The facts are the same as Example 3, except that the policy has a beneficiary designation that provides that, if the adjacent box is checked, the share of any deceased beneficiary shall be paid “in one sum and in equal shares to the children of that beneficiary who survive”. G did not check the box adjacent to this option.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       G’s deliberate decision not to check the box providing for the share of any deceased beneficiary to go to that beneficiary’s children constitutes a clear indication of a contrary intention for purposes of Section 2-701. A would be entitled to all of the proceeds of the policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 5.
       </i>
       G’s life-insurance policy names her niece, A, as primary beneficiary, and provides that if A does not survive her, the proceeds are to go to her niece B, as contingent beneficiary. A predeceased G, leaving children who survived G by 120 hours, B survived G by 120 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       The contingent beneficiary designation constitutes an “alternative beneficiary designation” for purposes of subsection (b)(4) [subsection (2)(d)], which supersedes the substitute gift to A’s descendants created by subsection (b)(1) [subsection (2)(a)]. The proceeds go to B, not to A’s children.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 6.
       </i>
       G’s life-insurance policy names her niece, A, as primary beneficiary, and provides that if A does not survive her, the proceeds are to go to her niece B, as contingent beneficiary. The printed terms of the policy specifically state that if neither the primary nor secondary beneficiaries survive the policyholder, the proceeds are payable to the policyholder’s estate. A predeceased G, leaving children who survived G by 120 hours, B also predeceased G, leaving children who survived G by 120 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       The second contingent beneficiary designation to G’s estate constitutes an “alternative beneficiary designation” for purposes of subsection (b)(4), which supersedes the substitute gifts to A’s and B’s descendants created by subsection (b)(1). The proceeds go to G’s estate, not to A’s children or to B’s children.

        Technical Amendments.
       </b>
       Technical amendments in 1993 added language specifically excluding joint and survivorship accounts and joint tenancies with the right of survivorship; this amendment is consistent with the original purpose of the section. Technical amendments in 2008 added definitions of “descendant of a grandparent” and “descendants” as used in subsections (b)(1) and (2) [subsections (2)(a) and (b)] and clarified subsection (b)(4) [subsection (2)(d)]. The two new definitions resolve questions of status previously unanswered. The technical amendment of subsection (b)(4) makes that subsection easier to understand but does not change its substance.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rationale.
       </b>
       The objective of this section is to project the antilapse idea into the area of future interests, thus preventing disinheritance of a descending line that has one or more members living on the distribution date and preventing a share from passing down a descending line that has died out by the distribution date.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Scope.
       </b>
       This section applies only to future interests under the terms of a trust. For shorthand purposes, references in this Comment to the term “future interest” refer to a future interest under the terms of a trust. The rationale for restricting this section to future interests under the terms of a trust is that legal life estates in land, followed by indefeasibly vested remainder interests, are still created in some localities, often with respect to farmland. In such cases, the legal life tenant and the person holding the remainder interest can, together, give good title in the sale of the land. If the antilapse idea were injected into this type of situation, the ability of the parties to sell the land would be impaired if not destroyed because the antilapse idea would, in effect, create a contingent substitute remainder interest in the present and future descendants of the person holding the remainder interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Structure.
       </b>
       The structure of this section substantially parallels the structure of the regular antilapse statute, Section 2-603 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-05; however, North Dakota has not adopted the current version], and the antilapse-type statute relating to beneficiary designations, Section 2-706 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-06].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Common-law Background.
       </b>
       At common law, conditions of survivorship are not implied with respect to future interests. The rule against implying a condition of survivorship applies whether the future interest is created in trust or otherwise and whether the future interest is or is not in the form of a class gift. The only exception, where a condition of survivorship is implied at common law, is in the case of a multiple-generation class gift. See Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers §§ 15.3, 15.4 (2008). For example, in the simple case of a trust, “income to husband, A, for life, remainder to daughter, B”, B’s interest is not defeated at common law if she predeceases A; B’s interest would pass through her estate to her successors in interest (probably either her residuary legatees or heirs: see Waggoner, “The Uniform Probate Code Extends Antilapse-Type Protection to Poorly Drafted Trusts”, 94 Mich. L. Rev. 2309, 2331-32 (1996)), who would become entitled to possession when A died. If any of B’s successors in interest died before A, the interest held by that deceased successor in interest would likewise pass through his or her estate to his or her successors in interest; and so on. Thus, a benefit of a statutory provision reversing the common-law rule and providing substitute takers is that it prevents cumbersome and costly distributions to and through the estates of deceased beneficiaries of future interests, who may have died long before the distribution date.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b) [Subsection (2)].
       </b>
       Subsection (b) [Subsection (2)] imposes a condition of survivorship on future interests to the distribution date—defined as the time when the future interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment. The requirement of survivorship imposed by subsection (b) applies whether or not the deceased beneficiary leaves descendants who survive the distribution date and are takers of a substitute gift provided by subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2) [subsections (2)(a) or (2)(b)]. Imposing a condition of survivorship on a future interest when the deceased beneficiary did not leave descendants who survive the distribution date prevents a share from passing down a descending line that has died out by the distribution date. Imposing a condition of survivorship on a future interest when the deceased beneficiary did leave descendants who survive the distribution date, and providing a substitute gift to those descendants, prevents disinheritance of a descending line that has one or more living members on the distribution date.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The 120-hour Survivorship Period.
       </b>
       In effect, the requirement of survival of the distribution date means survival of the 120-hour period following the distribution date. This is because, under Section 2-702(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-02(1)], “an individual who is not established to have survived an event … by 120 hours is deemed to have predeceased the event”. As made clear by subsection (a)(8) [subsection (1)(h)], for the purposes of section 2-707 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-07], the “event” to which section 2-702(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-02(1)] relates is the distribution date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the “distribution date” need not occur at the beginning or end of a calendar day, but can occur at a time during the course of a day, such as the time of death of an income beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p>
       References in Section 2-707 and in this Comment to survival of the distribution date should be understood as referring to survival of the distribution date by 120 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Ambiguous Survivorship Language.
       </b>
       Subsection (b) [Subsection (2)] serves another purpose. It resolves a frequently litigated question arising from ambiguous language of survivorship, such as in a trust, “income to A for life, remainder in corpus to my surviving children”. Although some case law interprets the word “surviving” as merely requiring survival of the testator (e.g., Nass’ Estate, 182 A. 401 (Pa.1936)), the predominant position at common law interprets “surviving” as requiring survival of the life tenant, A. Hawke v. Lodge, 77 A. 1090 (Del.Ch.1910); Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers §§ 15.3 cmt. f; 15.4 cmt. g (2008). The first sentence of subsection (b) [subsection (2)], in conjunction with paragraph (3) [subsection (2)(c)], codifies the predominant common-law/Restatement position that survival relates to the distribution date.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first sentence of subsection (b), in combination with paragraph (3), imposes a condition of survivorship to the distribution date (the time of possession or enjoyment) even when an express condition of survivorship to an earlier time has been imposed. Thus, in a trust like “income to A for life, remainder in corpus to B, but if B predeceases A, to B’s children who survive B”, the first sentence of subsection (b) combined with paragraph (3) requires B’s children to survive (by 120 hours) the death of the income beneficiary, A.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rule of Construction.
       </b>
       Note that Section 2-707 is a rule of construction. It is qualified by the rule set forth in Section 2-701 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-01], and thus it yields to a finding of a contrary intention. Consequently, in trusts like “income to A for life, remainder in corpus to B whether or not B survives A”, or “income to A for life, remainder in corpus to B or B’s estate”, this section would not apply and, should B predecease A, B’s future interest would pass through B’s estate to B’s successors in interest, who would become entitled to possession or enjoyment at A’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Classification.
       </b>
       Subsection (b) renders a future interest “contingent” on the beneficiary’s survival of the distribution date. As a result, future interests are “nonvested” and subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities. To prevent an injustice from resulting because of this, the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, which has a wait-and-see element, is incorporated into the Code as Part 9.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Substitute Gifts.
       </b>
       Section 2-707 not only imposes a condition of survivorship to the distribution date; like its antilapse counterparts, Sections 2-603 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-05; however, North Dakota has not adopted the current version] and 2-706 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-06], it provides substitute takers in cases of a beneficiary’s failure to survive the distribution date.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory substitute gift is divided among the devisee’s descendants “by representation”, a phrase defined in Section 2-709(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-09(2)]. A technical amendment adopted in 2008 added subsection (a)(4) [subsection (1)(d)], defining the term “descendants”.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(1) [Subsection (2)(a)]—Future Interests Not in the Form of a Class Gift.
       </b>
       Subsection (b)(1) applies to non-class gifts, such as the “income to A for life, remainder in corpus to B” trust discussed above. If B predeceases A, subsection (b)(1) creates a substitute gift with respect to B’s future 214 interest; the substitute gift is to B’s descendants who survive A (by 120 hours).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(2) [Subsection (2)(b)]—Class Gift Future Interests.
       </b>
       Subsection (b)(2) applies to single-generation class gifts, such as in a trust “income to A for life, remainder in corpus to A’s children”. See Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers §§ 14.1, 14.2 (2008). Suppose that A had two children, X and Y. X predeceases A; Y survives A. Subsection (b)(2) creates a substitute gift with respect to any of A’s children who fail to survive A (by 120 hours) leaving descendants who survive A (by 120 hours). Thus, if X left descendants who survived A (by 120 hours), those descendants would take X’s share; if X left no descendants who survived A (by 120 hours), Y would take it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(2) [subsection (2)(b)] does not apply to future interests to multiple-generation classes such as “issue”, “descendants”, “heirs of the body”, “heirs”, “next of kin”, “distributees”, “relatives”, “family”, or the like. The reason is that these types of class gifts have their own internal systems of representation, and so the substitute gift provided by subsection (b)(1) would be out of place with respect to these types of future interests. See Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers §§ 14.3, 14.4, 15.3 (2008). The first sentence of subsection (b) [subsection (2)] and subsection (d) [subsection (4)] do apply, however. For example, suppose a nonresiduary devise “to A for life, remainder to A’s issue, by representation”. If A leaves issue surviving him (by 120 hours), they take. But if A leaves no issue surviving him (by 120 hours), the testator’s residuary devisees are the takers.

      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (b)(4) [Subsection (2)(d)].
       </b>
       Subsection (b)(4), as clarified by technical amendment in 2008 [North Dakota did not adopt these technical amendments], provides that, if a governing instrument creates an alternative future interest with respect to a future interest for which a substitute gift is created by paragraph (1) or (2), the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative future interest if: (A) the alternative future interest is in the form of a class gift and one or more members of the class is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment; or (B) the alternative future interest is not in the form of a class gift and the expressly designated beneficiary of the alternative future interest is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment. Consider, for example, a trust under which the income is to be paid to A for life, remainder in corpus to B if B survives A, but if not to C if C survives A. If B predeceases A, leaving descendants who survive A (by 120 hours), subsection (b)(1) creates a substitute gift to those descendants. But, if C survives A (by 120 hours), the alternative future interest in C supersedes the substitute gift to B’s descendants. Upon A’s death, the trust corpus passes to C.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Subsection (c) [Subsection (3)].
       </b>
       Subsection (c) is necessary because there can be cases in which subsections (b)(1)or (b)(2) [subsections (2)(a) or (2)(b)] create substitute gifts with respect to two or more alternative future interests, and those substitute gifts are not superseded under the terms of subsection (b)(4) [subsection (2)(d)]. Subsection (c) provides the tie-breaking mechanism for such situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The initial step is to determine which of the alternative future interests would take effect had all the beneficiaries themselves survived the distribution date (by 120 hours). In subsection (c), this future interest is called the “primary future interest”. Unless subsection (c)(2) [subsection (3)(b)] applies, subsection (c)(1) [subsection (3)(a)] provides that the property passes under substitute gift created with respect to the primary future interest. This substitute gift is called the “primary substitute gift”. Thus, the property goes to the descendants of the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the primary future interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c)(2) [subsection (3)(b)] provides an exception to this rule. Under subsection (c)(2), the property does not pass under the primary substitute gift if there is a “younger-generation future interest”—defined as a future interest that (i) is to a descendant of a beneficiary of the primary future interest, (ii) is an alternative future interest with respect to the primary future interest, (iii) is a future interest for which a substitute gift is created, and (iv) would have taken effect had all the deceased beneficiaries who left surviving descendants survived the distribution date except the deceased beneficiary or beneficiaries of the primary future interest. If there is a younger-generation future interest, the property passes under the “younger-generation substitute gift”—defined as the substitute gift created with respect to the younger-generation future interest.

       Since it is possible that, after the application of subsections (b) and (c) [subsections (2) and (3)], there are no substitute gifts, a back-stop set of substitute takers is provided in subsection (d) [subsection (4)]—the transferor’s residuary devisees or heirs. Note that the transferor’s residuary clause is treated as creating a future interest and, as such, is subject to this section. Note also that the meaning of the back-stop gift to the transferor’s heirs is governed by Section 2-711 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-11], under which the gift is to the transferor’s heirs determined as if the transferor died when A died. Thus there will always be a set of substitute takers, even if it turns out to be the State. If the transferor’s surviving spouse has remarried after the transferor’s death but before A’s death, he or she would not be a taker under this provision.

        Examples.
       </b>
       The application of Section 2-707 is illustrated by the following examples. Note that, in each example, the “distribution date” is the time of the income beneficiary’s death. Assume, in each example, that an individual who is described as having “survived” the income beneficiary’s death survived the income beneficiary’s death by 120 hours or more.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 1.
       </i>
       A nonresiduary devise in G’s will created a trust, income to A for life, remainder in corpus to B if B survives A. G devised the residue of her estate to a charity. B predeceased A. At A’s death, B’s child, X, is living.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       On A’s death, the trust property goes to X, not to the charity. Because B’s future interest is not in the form of a class gift, subsection (b)(1) [subsection (2)(a)] applies, not (b)(2) [(2)(b)]. Subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] creates a substitute gift with respect to B’s future interest; the substitute gift is to B’s child, X. Under subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)], the words of survivorship attached to B’s future interest (“to B if B survives A”) do not indicate an intent contrary to the creation of that substitute gift. Nor, under subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)], is that substitute gift superseded by an alternative future interest because, as defined in subsection (a)(1) [(1)(a)], G’s residuary clause does not create an alternative future interest. In the normal lapse situation, a residuary clause does not supersede the substitute gift created by the antilapse statute, and the same analysis applies to this situation as well.

      <p>
       <i>

       </i>
       Same as Example 1, except that B left no descendants who survived A.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       Subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] does not create a substitute gift with respect to B’s future interest because B left no descendants who survived A. This brings subsection (d) [(4)] into operation, under which the trust property passes to the charity under G’s residuary clause.

      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       X takes the trust property. Because B’s future interest is not in the form of a class gift, subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] applies, not (b)(2) [(2)(b)]. Subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] creates a substitute gift with respect to B’s future interest; the substitute gift is to B’s child, X. Under subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)], the words of survivorship (“to B if B survives A”) do not indicate an intent contrary to the creation of that substitute gift. Nor, under subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)] , is the substitute gift superseded by an alternative future interest; G’s reversion is not an alternative future interest as defined in subsection (a)(1) [(1)(a)] because it was not expressly created.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 4.
       </i>
       G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, income to A for life, remainder in corpus to B if B survives A; if not, to C. B predeceased A. At A’s death, C and B’s child are living.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       C takes the trust property. Because B’s future interest is not in the form of a class gift, subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] applies, not (b)(2) [(2)(b)]. Subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] creates a substitute gift with respect to B’s future interest; the substitute gift is to B’s child, X. Under subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)], the words of survivorship (“to B if B survives A”) do not indicate an intent contrary to the creation of that substitute gift. But, under subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)], the substitute gift to B’s child is superseded by the alternative future interest held by C because C, having survived A (by 120 hours), is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 5.
       </i>
       G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust income to A for life, remainder in corpus to B, but if B predeceases A, to the person B appoints by will. B predeceased A. B’s will exercised his power of appointment in favor of C. C survives A. B’s child, X, also survives A.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       B’s appointee, C, takes the trust property, not B’s child, X. Because B’s future interest is not in the form of a class gift, subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] applies, not (b)(2) [(2)(b)]. Subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] creates a substitute gift with respect to B’s future interest; the substitute gift is to B’s child, X. Under subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)], the words of survivorship (“to B if B survives A”) do not indicate an intent contrary to the creation of that substitute gift. But, under subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)], the substitute gift to B’s child is superseded by the alternative future interest held by C because C, having survived A (by 120 hours), is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment. Because C’s future interest was created in “a” governing instrument (B’s will), it counts as an “alternative future interest”.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 6.
       </i>
       G creates an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, income to A for life, remainder in corpus to A’s children who survive A; if none, to B. A’s children predecease A, leaving descendants, X and Y, who survive A. B also survives A.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       On A’s death, the trust property goes to B, not to X and Y. Because the future interest in A’s children is in the form of a class gift (see Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers § 13.1 (2008)), subsection (b)(2) [(2)(b)] applies, not (b)(1) [(2)(a)]. Subsection (b)(2) [(2)(b)] creates a substitute gift with respect to the future interest in A’s children; the substitute gift is to the descendants of A’s children, X and Y. Under subsection (b)(3) [(2)(c)], the words of survivorship (“to A’s children who 217 survive A”) do not indicate an intent contrary to the creation of that substitute gift. But, under subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)], the alternative future interest to B supersedes the substitute gift to the descendants of A’s children because B survived A.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Alternative Facts:
       </i>
       One of A’s children, J, survives A; A’s other child, K, predeceases A, leaving descendants, X and Y, who survive A. B also survives A.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       J takes half the trust property and X and Y split the other half. Although there is an alternative future interest (in B) and although B did survive A, the alternative future interest was conditioned on none of A’s children surviving A. Because that condition was not satisfied, the expressly designated beneficiary of that alternative future interest, B, is not entitled to take in possession or enjoyment. Thus, the alternative future interest in B does not supersede the substitute gift to K’s descendants, X and Y.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 7.
       </i>
       G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, income to A for life, remainder in corpus to B if B survives A; if not, to C. B and C predecease A. At A’s death, B’s child and C’s child are living.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       Subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] produces substitute gifts with respect to B’s future interest and with respect to C’s future interest. B’s future interest and C’s future interest are alternative future interests, one to the other. B’s future interest is expressly conditioned on B’s surviving A. C’s future interest is conditioned on B’s predeceasing A and C’s surviving A. The condition that C survive A does not arise from express language in G’s trust but from the first sentence of subsection (b) [(2)]; that sentence makes C’s future interest contingent on C’s surviving A. Thus, because neither B nor C survived A, neither B nor C is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment. So, under subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)], neither substitute gift, created with respect to the future interests in B and C, is superseded by an alternative future interest. Consequently, resort must be had to subsection (c) [(3)] to break the tie to determine which substitute gift takes effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (c) [(3)], B is the beneficiary of the “primary future interest” because B would have been entitled to the trust property had both B and C survived A. Unless subsection (c)(2) [(3)(b)] applies, the trust property passes to B’s child as the taker under the “primary substitute gift”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c)(2) [(3)(b)] would only apply if C’s future interest qualifies as a “younger-generation future interest”. This depends upon whether C is a descendant of B, for C’s future interest satisfies the other requirements necessary to make it a younger-generation future interest. If C was a descendant of B, the substitute gift to C’s child would be a “younger-generation substitute gift” and would become effective instead of the “primary substitute gift” to B’s descendants. But if C was not a descendant of B, the property would pass under the “primary substitute gift” to B’s descendants.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 8.
       </i>
       G created an irrevocable inter-vivos trust, income to A for life, remainder in corpus to A’s children who survive A; if none, to B. All of A’s children predecease A. X and Y, who are descendants of one or more of A’s children, survive A. B predeceases A, leaving descendants, M and N, who survive A.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       On A’s death, the trust property passes to X and Y under the “primary substitute gift”, unless B was a descendant of any of A’s children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b)(2) [(2)(b)] produces substitute gifts with respect to A’s children who predeceased A leaving descendants who survived A. Subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] creates a substitute gift with respect to B’s future interest. A’s children’s future interest and B’s future interest are alternative future interests, one to the other. A’s children’s future interest is expressly conditioned on surviving A. B’s future interest is conditioned on none of A’s children surviving A and on B’s surviving A. The condition of survivorship as to B’s future interest does not arise because of express language in G’s trust but because of the first sentence of subsection (b) [(2)]; that sentence makes B’s future interest contingent on B’s surviving A. Thus, because none of A’s children survived A, and because B did not survive A, none of A’s children nor B is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment. So, under subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)], neither substitute gift—i.e., neither the one created with respect to the future interest in A’s children nor the one created with respect to the future interest in B—is superseded by an alternative future interest. Consequently, resort must be had to subsection (c) [(3)] to break the tie to determine which substitute gift takes effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (c) [(3)], A’s children are the beneficiaries of the “primary future interest” because they would have been entitled to the trust property had all of them and B survived A. Unless subsection (c)(2) [(3)(b)] applies, the trust property passes to X and Y as the takers under the “primary substitute gift”. Subsection (c)(2) [(3)(b)] would only apply if B’s future interest qualifies as a “younger-generation future interest”. This depends upon whether B is a descendant of any of A’s children, for B’s future interest satisfies the other requirements necessary to make it a “younger-generation future interest”. If B was a descendant of one of A’s children, the substitute gift to B’s children, M and N, would be a “younger-generation substitute gift” and would become effective instead of the “primary substitute gift” to X and Y. But if B was not a descendant of any of A’s children, the property would pass under the “primary substitute gift” to X and Y.

       G’s will devised property in trust, income to niece Lilly for life, corpus on Lilly’s death to her children; should Lilly die without leaving children, the corpus shall be equally divided among my nephews and nieces then living, the child or children of nieces who may be deceased to take the share their mother would have been entitled to if living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lilly never had any children. G had 3 nephews and 2 nieces in addition to Lilly. All 3 nephews and both nieces predeceased Lilly. A child of one of the nephews survived Lilly. One of the nieces had 8 children, 7 of whom survived Lilly. The other niece had one child, who did not survive Lilly. (This example is based on the facts of Bomberger’s Estate, 32 A.2d 729 (Pa.1943).)
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       The trust property goes to the 7 children of the nieces who survived Lilly. The substitute gifts created by subsection (b)(2) [(2)(b)] to the nephew’s son or to the nieces’ children are superseded under subsection (b)(4) [(2)(d)] because there is an alternative future interest (the “child or children of nieces who may be deceased”) and expressly designated beneficiaries of that alternative future interest (the 7 children of the nieces) are living at Lilly’s death and are entitled to take in possession or enjoyment.

       <i>
        Example 10.
       </i>
       G devised the residue of his estate in trust, income to his wife, W, for life, remainder in corpus to their children, John and Florence; if either John or Florence should predecease W, leaving descendants, such descendants shall take the share their parent would have 219 taken if living.
      </p>
      <p>
       G’s son, John, survived W. G’s daughter, Florence, predeceased W. Florence never had any children. Florence’s husband survived W. (This example is based on the facts of Matter of Kroos, 99 N.E.2d 222 (N.Y.1951).)
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Solution:
       </i>
       John, of course, takes his half of the trust property. Because Florence left no descendants who survived W, subsection (b)(1) [(2)(a)] does not create a substitute gift with respect to Florence’s future interest in her half. Subsection (d)(1) [(4)(a)] is inapplicable because G’s trust was not created in a nonresiduary devise or in a codicil to G’s will. Subsection (d)(2) [(4)(b)] therefore becomes applicable, under which Florence’s half goes to G’s heirs determined as if G died when W died, i.e., John. See Section 2-711 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-09.1-11].

        Purpose of New Section.
       </b>
       This new section provides statutory definitions of “representation,” “per capita at each generation,” and “per stirpes.” Subsection (b) [subsection (2)] applies to both private instruments and to provisions of applicable statutory law (such as Sections 2-603 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-05], 2-706 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-06], and 2-707 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-07]) that call for property to be divided “by representation.” The system of representation employed is the same as that which is adopted in Section 2-106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-04-06, repealed] for intestate succession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c)’s [subsection (3)] definition of “per stirpes” accords with the predominant understanding of the term. In 1993, the phrase “if any” was added to subsection (c) [this change was not adopted by North Dakota] to clarify the point that, under per stirpes, the initial division of the estate is made at the children generation even if no child survives the ancestor.

      If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for a present or future distribution to or creates a present or future interest in a designated individual’s “heirs”, “heirs at law”, “next of kin”, “relatives”, or “family”, or language of similar import, the property passes to those persons, including the state, and in such shares as would succeed to the designated individual’s intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the designated individual’s domicile if the designated individual died when the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment. If the designated individual’s surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment, the surviving spouse is not an heir of the designated individual.

        Purpose of New Section.
       </b>
       This new section provides a statutory definition of “heirs,” etc., when contained in a dispositive provision or a statute (such as Section 2-707(h) [there is no section 2-707(h)]). This section was amended in 1993 to make it applicable to present as well as future interests in favor of heirs and the like. Application of this section to present interests codifies the position of the Restatement (Second) of Property § 29.4 cmts. c &amp; g (1987).

      General Editorial Board Comment.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 8 contains five general provisions that cut across probate and nonprobate transfers. Part 8 previously contained a sixth provision, Section 2-801, which dealt with disclaimers. Section 2-801 was replaced in 2002 by the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act, which is incorporated into the Code as Part 11 of Article 2 (§§ 2-1101 to 2-1117 [N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-10.1). To avoid renumbering the other sections in this Part, Section 2-801 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-01, repealed] is reserved for possible future use.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 2-802 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-02] deals with the effect of divorce and separation on the right to elect against a will, exempt property and allowances, and an intestate share.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 2-803 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-03] spells out the legal consequence of intentional and felonious killing on the right of the killer to take as heir and under wills and revocable inter-vivos transfers, such as revocable trusts and life-insurance beneficiary designations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 2-804 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-04] deals with the consequences of a divorce on the right of the former spouse (and relatives of the former spouse) to take under wills and revocable inter-vivos transfers, such as revocable trusts and life-insurance beneficiary designations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sections 2-805 and 2-806 [N.D.C.C. §§
   30.1-10-05 and 30.1-10-06], added in 2008, bring the reformation provisions in the Uniform Trust Code into the UPC.

     Under Section 8-101(b) [ N.D.C.C. §

       <b>
        Clarifying Revision.
       </b>
       The only substantive revision of this section is a clarifying revision of subsection (b)(2) [subsection (2)(b)], making it clear that this subsection refers to an invalid decree of divorce or annulment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Rationale.
       </b>
       Although some existing statutes bar the surviving spouse for desertion or adultery, the present section requires some definitive legal act to bar the surviving spouse. Normally, this is divorce. Subsection (a) [subsection (1)] states an obvious proposition, but subsection (b) [subsection (2)] deals with the difficult problem of invalid divorce or annulment, which is particularly frequent as to foreign divorce decrees but may arise as to a local decree where there is some defect in jurisdiction; the basic principle underlying these provisions is estoppel against the surviving spouse. Where there is only a legal separation, rather than a divorce, succession patterns are not affected; but if the separation is accompanied by a complete property settlement, this may operate under Section 2-213 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-05-07] as a waiver or renunciation of benefits under a prior will and by intestate succession.

        Purpose and Scope of Revisions.
       </b>
       This section is substantially revised. Although the revised version does make a few substantive changes in certain subsidiary rules (such as the treatment of multiple party accounts, etc.), it does not alter the main thrust of the pre-1990 version. The major change is that the revised version is more comprehensive than the pre-1990 version. The structure of the section is also changed so that it substantially parallels the structure of Section 2-804 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-04], which deals with the effect of divorce on revocable benefits to the former spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pre-1990 version of this section was bracketed to indicate that it may be omitted by an enacting state without difficulty. The revised version omits the brackets because the Joint Editorial Board/Article II Drafting Committee believes that uniformity is desirable on the question.
      </p>
      <p>
       As in the pre-1990 version, this section is confined to felonious and intentional killing and excludes the accidental manslaughter killing. Subsection (g) [subsection (7)] leaves no doubt that, for purposes of this section, a killing can be “felonious and intentional,” whether or not the killer has actually been convicted in a criminal prosecution. Under subsection (g) [subsection (7)], after all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively establishes the convicted individual as the decedent’s killer for purposes of this section. Acquittal, however, does not preclude the acquitted individual from being regarded as the decedent’s killer for purposes of this section. This is because different considerations as well as a different burden of proof enter into the finding of criminal accountability in the criminal prosecution. Hence it is possible that the defendant on a murder charge may be found not guilty and acquitted, but if the same person claims as an heir, devisee, or beneficiary of a revocable beneficiary designation, etc. of the decedent, the probate Court, upon the petition of an interested person, may find that, under a preponderance of the evidence standard, he or she would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent and thus be barred under this section from sharing in the affected property. In fact, in many of the cases arising under this section there may be no criminal prosecution because the killer has committed suicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is now well accepted that the matter dealt with is not exclusively criminal in nature but is also a proper matter for probate Courts. The concept that a wrongdoer may not profit by his or her own wrong is a civil concept, and the probate Court is the proper forum to determine the effect of killing on succession to the decedent’s property covered by this section. There are numerous situations where the same conduct gives rise to both criminal and civil consequences. A killing may result in criminal prosecution for murder and civil litigation by the decedent’s family under wrongful death statutes. Another analogy exists in the tax field, where a taxpayer may be acquitted of tax fraud in a criminal prosecution but found to have committed the fraud in a civil proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrases “criminal accountability” and “criminally accountable” for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent not only include criminal accountability as an actor or direct perpetrator, but also as an accomplice or co-conspirator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike the pre-1990 version, the revised version contains a subsection protecting payors who pay before receiving written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section, and imposing personal liability on the recipient or killer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pre-1990 version’s provision on the severance of joint tenancies and tenancies by the entirety also extended to “joint and multiple party accounts in banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and other institutions, and any other form of co-ownership with survivorship incidents.” Under subsection (c)(2) [subsection (3)(b)] of the revised version, the severance applies only to “property held by [the decedent and killer] as joint tenants with the right of survivorship [or as community property with the right of survivorship].” The terms “joint tenants with the right of survivorship” and “community property with the right of survivorship” are defined in Section 1-201 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-06]. That definition includes tenancies by the entirety, but excludes “forms of co-ownership registration in which the underlying ownership of each party is in proportion to that party’s contribution.” Under subsection (c)(1) [subsection (3)(a)], any portion of the decedent’s contribution to the co-ownership registration running in favor of the killer would be treated as a revocable and revoked disposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) [subsection (5)] was amended in 1993 to make it clear that the antilapse statute applies in appropriate cases in which the killer is treated as having disclaimed.

        ERISA Preemption of State Law.
       </b>
       The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) federalizes pension and employee benefit law. Section 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a), provides that the provisions of Titles I and IV of ERISA “shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan” governed by ERISA. See the Comment to Section 2-804 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-04] for a discussion of the ERISA preemption question.

        1997 Technical Amendment.
       </b>
       By technical amendment effective July 31, 1997, the word “equal” was added to subsection (c)(2) [subsection (3)(b)] to make it clear that the effect of severing the interests of the decedent and killer is to transform their interest into equal tenancies in common, without regard to the percentage of consideration furnished by either [this change was not made in North Dakota’s provision, which instead provides for voiding of any interest held as joint tenant with right of survivorship with the decedent]]. Although this was the intent of this subsection, the court in Estate of Garland, 928 P.2d 928 (Mont. 1996), misconstrued the original language and held that once the interests were severed and transformed into tenancies in common, the shares “depend on the decedent’s and the [killer’s] individual contributions to the acquisition and maintenance of the property.” This percentage-of consideration rule is inconsistent with both the general principle of section 2-803 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-03] and with the statutory language. Section 2-803 [this section] is based on the principle that while the killer should not gain from the killing, neither should the killer be deprived of the killer’s own property. In the case of a joint tenancy, neither the killer nor the victim could by a lawful, unilateral act have severed and become owner of more than his or her fractional interest. This is true even if one joint tenant provided more consideration than another joint tenant. Once property is titled in joint tenancy, any excess consideration provided by one joint tenant constitutes an irrevocable gift to the other joint tenant or tenants. The original statutory language established a fractional-interest rule by providing that the interests that are transformed into tenancies in common are “the [severed] interests of the decedent and killer.” The statutory language, as revived, confirms this strict fractioning.

         The written notice must indicate the name of the decedent, the name of the person asserting an interest, the nature of the payment or item of property or other benefit, and a statement that a divorce, annulment, or remarriage of the decedent and the designated beneficiary occurred. Written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage under this subdivision must be mailed to the payer’s or other third party’s main office or home by registered mail or served upon the payer or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Upon receipt of written notice of the divorce, annulment, or remarriage, a payer or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent’s estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents’ estates located in the county of the decedent’s residence. In addition to the actions available under this section, the payer or other third party may take any action authorized by law or the governing instrument. If no probate proceedings have been commenced, the payer or other third party shall file with the court a copy of the written notice received by the payer or other third party with the payment of funds or transfer or deposit of property. The court may not charge a filing fee to the payer or other third party for the payment to the court of amounts owed or transferred to or deposit with the court of any item of property, even if no probate proceedings have been commenced before the payment, transfer, or deposit. The court shall hold the funds or item of property and, upon its determination under this section, shall order disbursement or transfer in accordance with the determination. A filing fee, if any, may be charged upon disbursement either to the recipient or against the funds or property on deposit with the court, in the discretion of the court. Payments, transfers, or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payer or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

       <b>
        Purpose and Scope of Revision.
       </b>
       The revisions of this section, pre-1990 Section 2-508, intend to unify the law of probate and nonprobate transfers. As originally promulgated, pre-1990 Section 2-508 revoked a pre-divorce devise to the testator’s former spouse. The revisions expand the section to cover “will substitutes” such as revocable inter-vivos trusts, life-insurance and retirement-plan beneficiary designations, transfer-on-death accounts, and other revocable dispositions to the former spouse that the divorced individual established before the divorce (or annulment). As revised, this section also effects a severance of the interests of the former spouses in property that they held at the time of the divorce (or annulment) as joint tenants with the right of survivorship; their co-ownership interests become tenancies in common.
      </p>
      <p>
       As revised, this section is the most comprehensive provision of its kind, but many states have enacted piecemeal legislation tending in the same direction. For example, Michigan and Ohio have statutes transforming spousal joint tenancies in land into tenancies in common upon the spouses’ divorce. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 552.102; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 5302.20(c)(5). Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee have recently enacted legislation effecting a revocation of provisions for the settlor’s former spouse in revocable inter-vivos trusts. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 1339.62; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 60, § 175; Tenn. Code Ann. § 35-50-5115 (applies to revocable and irrevocable inter-vivos trusts). Statutes in Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Texas relate to the consequence of divorce on life-insurance and retirement-plan beneficiary designations. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. § 552.101; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 1339.63; Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, § 178; Tex. Fam. Code §§ 3.632-633.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Courts have also come under increasing pressure to use statutory construction techniques to extend statutes like the pre-1990 version of Section 2-508 to various will substitutes.
   In Clymer v. Mayo, 473 N.E.2d 1084 (Mass.1985), the Massachusetts Court held the statute applicable to a revocable inter-vivos trust, but restricted its “holding to the particular facts of this case-specifically the existence of a revocable pour-over trust funded entirely at the time of the decedent’s death.”
   473 N.E.2d at 1093. The trust in that case was an unfunded life-insurance trust; the life insurance was employer-paid life insurance.
   In Miller v. First Nat’l Bank &amp; Tr. Co., 637 P.2d 75 (Okla. 1981), the Court also held such a statute to be applicable to an unfunded life-insurance trust. The testator’s will devised the residue of his estate to the trustee of the life-insurance trust. Despite the absence of meaningful evidence of intent to incorporate, the Court held that the pour-over devise incorporated the life-insurance trust into the will be reference, and thus was able to apply the revocation-upon-divorce statute. In Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Stitzel, 1 Pa. Fiduc.2d 316 (C.P.1981), however, the Court held a statute similar to the pre-1990 version of Section 2-508 to be inapplicable to effect a revocation of a life-insurance beneficiary designation of the former spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Revoking Benefits of the Former Spouse’s Relatives.
       </b>
       In several cases, including Clymer v. Mayo, 473 N.E.2d 1084 (Mass. 1985), and Estate of Coffed, 387 N.E.2d 1209 (N.Y. 1979), the result of treating the former spouse as if he or she predeceased the testator was that a gift in the governing instrument was triggered in favor of relatives of the former spouse who, after the divorce, were no longer relatives of the testator. In the Massachusetts case, the former spouse’s nieces and nephews ended up with an interest in the property. In the New York case, the winners included the former spouse’s child by a prior marriage. For other cases to the same effect, see Porter v. Porter, 286 N.W.2d 649 (Iowa 1979); Bloom v. Selfon, 555 A.2d 75 (Pa. 1989); Estate of Graef, 368 N.W.2d 633 (Wis. 1985). Given that, during divorce process or in the aftermath of the divorce, the former spouse’s relatives are likely to side with the former spouse, breaking down or weakening any former ties that may previously have developed between the transferor and the former spouse’s relatives, seldom would the transferor have favored such a result. This section, therefore, also revokes these gifts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Consequence of Revocation.
       </b>
       The effect of revocation by this section is that the provisions of the governing instrument are given effect as if the divorced individual’s former spouse (and relatives of the former spouse) disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section (see Section 2-1106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03] for the effect of a disclaimer). Note that this means that the antilapse statute applies in appropriate cases in which the divorced individual or relative is treated as having disclaimed. In the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, the provisions of the governing instrument are given effect as if the former spouse and relatives of the former spouse died immediately before the divorce or annulment. If the divorced individual (or relative of the divorced individual) is the donee of an unexercised power of appointment that is revoked by this section, the gift-in-default clause, if any, is to take effect, to the extent that the gift-in-default clause is not itself revoked by this section.

       <b>
        ERISA Preemption of State Law.
       </b>
       The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) federalizes pension and employee benefit law. Section 514(a) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a), provides that the provisions of Titles I and IV of ERISA “shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan” governed by ERISA.
      </p>
      <p>
       ERISA’s preemption clause is extraordinarily broad. ERISA Section 514(a) does not merely preempt state laws that conflict with specific provisions in ERISA. Section 514(a) preempts “any and all State laws” insofar as they “relate to” any ERISA-governed employee benefit plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       A complex case law has arisen concerning the question of whether to apply ERISA Section 514(a) to preempt state law in circumstances in which ERISA supplies no substantive regulation. For example, until 1984, ERISA contained no authorization for the enforcement of state domestic relations decrees against pension accounts, but the federal Courts were virtually unanimous in refusing to apply ERISA preemption against such state decrees. See, e.g., American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. Merry, 592 F.2d 118 (2d Cir. 1979). The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 amended ERISA to add Sections 206(d)(3) and 514(b)(7), confirming the judicially created exception for state domestic relations decrees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The federal Courts have been less certain about whether to defer to local probate law. In Board of Trustees of Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust Fund v. H.F. Johnson, Inc., 830 F.2d 1009 (9th Cir.1987), the Court held that ERISA preempted the Montana nonclaim statute (which is Section 3-803 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-03] of the Uniform Probate Code). On the other hand, in Mendez-Bellido v. Board of Trustees, 709 F.Supp. 329 (E.D.N.Y.1989), the Court applied the New York “slayer-rule” against an ERISA preemption claim, reasoning that “state laws prohibiting murderers from receiving death benefits are relatively uniform [and therefore] there is little threat of creating a ‘patchwork scheme of regulations’” that ERISA sought to avoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is to be hoped that the federal Courts will continue to show sensitivity to the primary role of state law in the field of probate and nonprobate transfers. To the extent that the federal Courts think themselves unable to craft exceptions to ERISA’s preemption language, it is open to them to apply local law concepts as federal common law. Because the Uniform Probate Code contemplates multistate applicability, it is well suited to be the model for federal common law absorption.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another avenue of reconciliation between ERISA preemption and the primacy of state law in this field is envisioned in subsection (h)(2) [subsection (8)(b)] of this section. It imposes a personal liability for pension payments that pass to a former spouse or relative of a former spouse. This provision respects ERISA’s concern that federal law govern the administration of the plan, while still preventing unjust enrichment that would result if an unintended beneficiary were to receive the pension benefits. Federal law has no interest in working a broader disruption of state probate and nonprobate transfer law than is required in the interest of smooth administration of pension and employee benefit plans.

       </b>
       In 2002, the Code’s former disclaimer provision (§ 2-801 [N.D.C.C. 30.1-10-06, repealed]) was replaced by the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act, which is incorporated into the Code as Part 11 of Article 2 (§§ 2-1101 – 2-1117 [N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-10.1). The statutory references in this Comment to former section 2-801 have been replaced by appropriate references to Part 11. Updating these statutory references has not changed the substance of this Comment.

      General Editorial Board Comment.

    </p>
    <p>
     Part 11 incorporates into the Code the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act (UDIPA or Act). The UDPIA replaces the Code’s former disclaimer provision (Section 2-801 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-01, repealed]). It also replaces three Uniform Acts promulgated in 1978 (Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act, Uniform Disclaimer of Transfers by Will, Intestacy or Appointment Act, and Uniform Disclaimer of Transfers under Nontestatmentary Instruments Act). The new Act is the most comprehensive disclaimer statute ever written. It is designed to allow every sort of disclaimer, including those that are useful for tax planning purposes. It does not, however, include a specific time limit on the making of any disclaimer. Because a disclaimer is a refusal to accept, the only bar to a disclaimer should be acceptance of the offer. In addition, in almost all jurisdictions disclaimers can be used for more than tax planning. A proper disclaimer will often keep the disclaimed property from the disclaimant’s creditors. In short, the new Act is an enabling statute which prescribes all the rules for refusing a proffered interest in or power over property and the effect of that refusal on the power or interest while leaving the effect of the refusal itself to other law. Section 2-1113(e) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-10(5)] explicitly states that a disclaimer may be barred or limited by law other than the Act.
    </p>
    <p>
     The decision not to include a specific time limit– to “decouple” the disclaimer statute from the time requirement applicable to a “qualified disclaimer” under IRC § 2518–is also designed to reduce confusion. The older Uniform Acts and almost all the current state statutes (many of which are based on those Acts) were drafted in the wake of the passage of IRC § 2518 in 1976. That provision replaced the “reasonable time” requirement of prior law with a requirement that a disclaimer must be made within nine months of the creation of the interest disclaimed if the disclaimer is to be a “qualified disclaimer” which is not regarded as transfer by the disclaimant. The statutes that were written in response to this new provision of tax law reflected the nine month time limit. Under most of these statutes (including the older Uniform Acts and former Section 2-801) a disclaimer must be made within nine months of the creation of a present interest (for example, as disclaimer of an outright gift under a will must be made within nine months of the decedent’s death), which corresponds to the requirement of IRC § 2518. A future interest, however, may be disclaimed within nine months of the time the interest vests in possession or enjoyment (for example, a remainder whether or not contingent on surviving the holder of the life income interest must be disclaimed within nine months of the death of the life income beneficiary). The time limit for future interests does not correspond to IRC § 2518 which generally requires that a qualified disclaimer of a future interest be made within nine months of the interest’s creation, no matter how contingent it may then be. The nine-month time limit of the existing statutes really is a trap. While it superficially conforms to IRC § 2518, its application to the disclaimer of future interests does not. The removal of all mention of time limits will clearly signal the practitioner that the requirements for a tax qualified disclaimer are set by different law.
    </p>
    <p>
     The elimination of the time limit is not the only change from current statutes. The Act abandons the concept of “relates back” as a proxy for when a disclaimer becomes effective. Instead, by stating specifically when a disclaimer becomes effective and explicitly stating in Section 2-1105(f) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-02(6)] that a disclaimer “is not a transfer, assignment, or release,” the Act makes clear the results of refusing property or powers through a disclaimer. Second, UDPIA creates rules for several types of disclaimers that have not been explicitly addressed in previous statutes. The Act provides detailed rules for the disclaimer of interests in jointly held property (Section 2-1107 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-04]). Such disclaimers have important uses especially in tax planning, but their status under current law is not clear. Furthermore, although current statutes mention the disclaimer of jointly held property, they provide no details. Recent developments in the law of qualified disclaimers of jointly held property make fuller treatment of such disclaimers necessary. Section 2-1108 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-05] addresses the disclaimer by trustees of property that would otherwise become part of the trust. The disclaimer of powers of appointment and other powers not held in a fiduciary capacity is treated in Section 2-1109 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-06] and disclaimers by appointees, objects, and takers in default of exercise of a power of appointment is the subject of Section 2-1110 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-07]. Finally, Section 2-1111 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-08] provides rules for the disclaimer of powers held in a fiduciary capacity.

       [Section 2-1101 of the Uniform Probate Code is reserved. The comment to this reserved section reads as follows: This Section is marked “Reserved” in order to preserve corresponding numbering between the free-standing form of the Uniform Disclaimers of Property Interests Act (1999) and its version as codified in the Uniform Probate Code. The result is that Section 2 of the free-standing act becomes Section 2-1102 of the UPC, and so on.]
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “disclaimant” (paragraph (1) [paragraph (2)]) limits the term to the person who would have received the disclaimed property or power if the disclaimer had not been made. The disclaimant is not necessarily the person making the disclaimer, who may be a guardian, custodian, or other fiduciary acting for the disclaimant or the personal representative of the disclaimant’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “disclaimed interest” (paragraph (2) [paragraph (3)]) refers to the subject matter of a disclaimer of an interest in property and provides a compact term the use of which simplifies the drafting of Section 2-1106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03].
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “disclaimer” (paragraph (3) [paragraph (4)]) expands previous definitions. Prior Uniform Acts provided for a disclaimer of “the right of succession to any property or interest therein” and former Section 2-801 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-01, repealed] referred to “an interest in or with respect to property or an interest therein.” These previously authorized types of disclaimers are continued by the present language referring to “an interest in ... property.” The language referring to “power over property” broadens the permissible scope of disclaimers to include any power over property that gives the power-holder a right to control property, whether it be cast in the form of a power of appointment or a fiduciary’s management power over property or discretionary power of distribution over income or corpus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Act, a “fiduciary” (defined in paragraph (4) [paragraph (6)]) is given the power to disclaim except where specifically prohibited by state law by the document creating the fiduciary relationship. See Section 2-1104(b) [not adopted by North Dakota]
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “jointly held property” (paragraph (5) [paragraph (8)]) includes not only a traditional joint tenancy but also other property that is “held,” but may not be “owned,” by two or more persons with a right of survivorship. One form of such property is a joint bank account between parties who are not married to each other which, under the laws of many States, is owned by the parties in proportion to their deposits. (See Section 6-211(b) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-08(2)])
   This “holding” concept, as opposed to “owning,” may also be true with joint brokerage accounts under the law of some States. See Treas. Regs. § 25.2518-2(c)(4).
      </p>
      <p>
       The terms “person” (paragraph (6), “State” (paragraph (7) [paragraph (11)]), and “trust” (paragraph (8) [paragraph (12)]) are also defined in Section 1-201 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-06] of this Code, but the more modern version of these definitions is included here for ease of reference. For purposes of this Part, the definitions in this Section control. [North Dakota’s adoption of this section does not include the definition for “person”]
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “trust” (paragraph (8) [paragraph (12)]) means an express trust, whether private or charitable, including a trust created by statute, court judgment or decree which is to be administered in the manner of an express trust. Excluded from the Act’s coverage are resulting and constructive trusts, which are not express trusts but remedial devices imposed by law. The Act is directed primarily at express trust which arise in an estate planning or other donative context, but the definition of “trust” is not so limited. A trust created pursuant to a divorce action would be included, even though such a trust is not donative but is created pursuant to a bargained for exchange. The extent to which even more commercially-oriented trusts are subject to the Act will vary depending on the type of trust and the laws, other than this Act, under which the trust is created. Commercial trusts come in various forms, including created pursuant to a state business trust act and trusts created to administer specified funds, such as to pay a pension or to manage pooled investments. See John H. Langbein, The Secret Life of the Trust: The Trust as an Instrument of Commerce, 107 Yale L.J. 165 (1997).

       Subsections (a) and (b) [subsections (1) and (2)] give both persons (as defined in Section 2-1102(6)) [definition of “person” not included in North Dakota’s adoption of this section] and fiduciaries (as defined in Section 2-1102(4) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-01(6)]) and other persons a broad power to disclaim both interests in and powers over property. In both instances, the ability to disclaim interests is comprehensive; it does not matter whether the disclaimed interest is vested, either in interest or in possession. For example, Father’s will creates a testamentary trust which is to pay income to his descendants and after the running of the traditional perpetuities period is to terminate and be distributed to his descendants then living by representation. If at any time there are no descendants, the trust is to terminate and be distributed to collateral relatives. At the time of Father’s death he has many descendants and the possibility of his line dying out and the collateral relatives taking under the trust is remote in the extreme. Nevertheless, under the Act the collateral relatives may disclaim their contingent remainders. In order to make a qualified disclaimer for tax purposes, however, they must disclaim them within 9 months of Father’s death.) Every sort of power may also be disclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) continues the provisions of current law by making ineffective any attempt to limit the right to disclaim which the creator of an interest or non-fiduciary power seeks to impose on a person. This provision follows from the principle behind all disclaimers – no one can be forced to accept property – and extends that principle to powers over property.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Act also gives fiduciaries broad powers to disclaim both interests and powers. A fiduciary who may also be a beneficiary of the fiduciary arrangement may disclaim in either capacity. For example, a trustee who is also one of several beneficiaries of a trust may have the power to invade trust principal for the beneficiaries. The trustee may disclaim the power as trustee under Section 2-1111 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-08] or may disclaim as a holder of a power of appointment under Section 2-1109 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-06]. Subsection (b) also gives fiduciaries the right to disclaim in spite of spendthrift or similar restrictions given, but subjects that right to a restriction applicable only to fiduciaries. As a policy matter, the creator of a trust or other arrangement creating a fiduciary relationship should be able to prevent a fiduciary accepting office under the arrangement from altering the parameters of the relationship. This reasoning also applies to fiduciary relationships created by statute such as those governing conservatorships and guardianships. Subsection (b) therefore does not override express restrictions on disclaimers contained in the instrument creating the fiduciary relationship or in other statutes of the State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) [subsection (3)] sets forth the formal requirements for a disclaimer. The definitions of “record” and “signed” in this subsection are derived from the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act § 102 [North Dakota has adopted these definitions as paragraphs (9) and (10) of 30.1-10.1-01]. The definitions recognize that a disclaimer may be prepared in forms other than typewritten pages with a signature in pen. Because of the novelty of a disclaimer executed in electronic form and the ease with which the term “record” can be confused with recording of documents, the Act does not use the term “record” in isolation but refers to “writing or other record.” The delivery requirement is set forth in Section 2-1112 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-09].
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) [subsection (4)] specifically allows a partial disclaimer of an interest in property or of a power over property, and gives the disclaimant wide latitude in describing the portion disclaimed. For example, a residuary beneficiary of an estate may disclaim a fraction or percentage of the residue or may disclaim specific property included in the residue (all the shares of X corporation or a specific number of shares). A devisee or donee may disclaim specific acreage or an undivided fraction or carve out a life estate or remainder from a larger interest in real or personal property. (It must be noted, however, that a disclaimer by a devisee or donee which seeks to “carve out” a remainder or life estate is not a “qualified disclaimer” for tax purposes, Treas. Reg. § 25.2518-3(b).)
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) [subsection (5)] makes the disclaimer irrevocable on the later to occur of (i) delivery or filing or (ii) its becoming effective under the section governing the disclaimer of the particular power or interest. A disclaimer must be “irrevocable” in order to be a qualified disclaimer for tax purposes. Since a disclaimer under this Act becomes effective at the time significant for tax purposes, a disclaimer under this Act will always meet the irrevocability requirement for tax qualification. The interaction of the Act and the requirements for a tax qualified disclaimer can be illustrated by analyzing a disclaimer of an interest in a revocable lifetime trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       <i>
        Example 1
       </i>
       . G creates a revocable lifetime trust which will terminate on G’s death and distribute the trust property to G’s surviving descendants by representation. G’s son, S, determines that he would prefer his share of G’s estate to pass to his descendants and executes a disclaimer of his interest in the revocable trust. The disclaimer is then delivered to G (see Section 2-1112(e)(3) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-09(4)). The disclaimer is not irrevocable at that time, however, because it will not become effective until G’s death when the trust becomes irrevocable (see Section 2-1106(b)(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(2)]). Because the disclaimer will not become irrevocable until it becomes effective at G’s death, S may recall the disclaimer before G’s death and, if he does so, the disclaimer will have no effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (f) [subsection (6)] restates the long standing rule that a disclaimer is a true refusal to accept and not an act by which the disclaimant transfers, assigns, or releases the disclaimed interest. This subsection states the effect and meaning of the traditional “relation back” doctrine of prior Acts. It also makes it clear that the disclaimed interest passes without direction by the disclaimant, a requirement of tax qualification.

        The legislature did not expressly make renunciation a disqualifying act under section 50-24.1-02(1), although it could have easily so provided; nor did it define the terms “assignment” or “transfer”. However, as commonly understood, those terms connoted an act of designating or conveying a thing from one person to another. One who assigned or transferred a property designated the assignee or transferee and the terms of the conveyance. In contrast, one who renounced a bequest or inheritance under this section could not designate the recipient or otherwise control the disposition of the renounced property. Nielsen v. Cass County Social Servs. Bd., 395 N.W.2d 157 (N.D. 1986), decided prior to the 1987 amendment to N.D.C.C. § 50-24.1-02(1).

      <p>
       Subsection (a) [these definitions are contained in N.D.C.C. § 30.1-10.1-01] defines two terms that are used only in Section 2-1106 [this section]. The first, “future interest,” is used in Section 2-1106(b)(4) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(5)] in connection with the acceleration rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second defined term, “time of distribution,” is used in determining to whom the disclaimed interest passes (see below). Possession or enjoyment is a term of art and means that time at which it is certain to whom the property belongs. It does not mean that the person actually has the property in hand. For example, the time of distribution of present interests created by will and all interests arising under the law of intestate succession is the death of the decedent. At that moment the heir or devisee is entitled to his or her devise or share, and it is irrelevant that time will pass before the will is admitted to probate and that actual receipt of the gift may not occur until the administration of the estate is complete. The time of distribution of present interests created by nontestamentary instruments generally depends on when the instrument becomes irrevocable. Because the recipient of a present interest is entitled to the property as soon as the gift is made, the time of distribution occurs when the creator of the interest can no longer take it back. The time of distribution of a future interest is the time when it comes into possession and the owner of the future interest becomes the owner of a present interest. For example, if B is the owner of the remainder interest in a trust which is to pay income to A for life, the time of distribution of B’s remainder is A’s death. At that time the trust terminated and B’s ownership of the remainder becomes outright ownership of the trust property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-1106(b)(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(2)] makes a disclaimer of an interest in property effective as of the time the instrument creating the interest becomes irrevocable or at the decedent’s death if the interest is created by intestate succession. A will and a revocable trust are irrevocable at the testator’s or settlor’s death. Inter vivos trusts may also be irrevocable at their creation or may become irrevocable before the settlor’s death. A beneficiary designation is also irrevocable at death, unless it is made irrevocable at an earlier time. This provision continues the provision of Uniform Acts on this subject, but with different wording. Previous Acts have stated that the disclaimer “relates back” to some time before the disclaimed interest was created. The relation back doctrine gives effect to the special nature of the disclaimer as a refusal to accept. Because the disclaimer “relates back,” the disclaimant is regarded as never having had an interest in the disclaimed property. A disclaimer by a devisee against whom there is an outstanding judgment will prevent the creditor from reaching the property the debtor would otherwise inherit. This Act continues the effect of the relation back doctrine, not by using the specific words, but by directly stating what the relation back doctrine has been interpreted to mean. Sections 2-1102(3) and 2-1105(f) [N.D.C.C. §§
   30.1-10.1-01(4) and 30.1-10.1-02(6)] taken together define a disclaimer as a refusal to accept which is not a transfer or release, and subsection (b)(1) [subsection (2)] of this section makes the disclaimer effective as of the time the creator cannot revoke the interest. Nothing in the statute, however, prevents the legislatures or the courts from limiting the effect of the disclaimer as refusal doctrine in specific situations or generally. See the Comments to Section 2-1113 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-10] below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-1106(b)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(3)] allows the creator of the instrument to control the disposition of the disclaimed interest by express provision in the instrument. The provision may apply to a particular interest. “I give to my cousin A the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and should he disclaim any part of this gift, I give the part disclaimed to my cousin B.” The provision may also apply to all disclaimed interests. A residuary clause beginning “I give my residuary estate, including all disclaimed interests to.... “ is such a provision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sections 2-1106(b)(3)(B), (C), and (D) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(4)] apply if Section 2-1106(b)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(3)] does not and if the disclaimant is an individual. Because “disclaimant” is defined as the person to whom the disclaimed interest would have passed had the disclaimer not been made (Section 2-1102(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-01(2)], these paragraphs would apply to disclaimers by fiduciaries on behalf of individuals. The general rule is that the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant had died immediately before the time of distribution defined in Section 2-1106(a)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-01(5)]. The application of this general rule to present interests given to named individuals is illustrated by the following examples:
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 1(a).
       </b>
       T’s will devised “ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to my brother, B.” B disclaims the entire devise. B is deemed to have predeceased T, and, therefore B’s gift has lapsed. If the State’s antilapse statute applies, it will direct the passing of the disclaimed interest. Under Section 2-603(b)(1) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-05; however, North Dakota has not adopted the current UPC version of this section], for example, B’s descendants who survive T by 120 hours will take the devise by representation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 1(b).
       </b>
       T’s will devised “ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to my friend, F.” F disclaims the entire devise. F is deemed to predecease T and the gift has lapsed. Few antilapse statutes apply to devises to non-family members. Under Section 2-603(b), which saves from lapse only gifts made to certain relatives, the devise would lapse and pass through the residuary clause of the will.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 1(c).
       </b>
       T’s will devised “ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to my brother, B, but if B does not survive me, to my children.” If B disclaims the devise, he will be deemed to have predeceased T and the alternative gift to T’s children will dispose of the devise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Present interests are also given to the surviving members of a class or group of persons. Perhaps the most common example of this gift is a devise of the testator’s residuary estate “to my descendants who survive me by representation.” Under the system of distribution among multi-generational classes used in Section 2-709 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-09], division of the property to be distributed begins in the eldest generation in which there are living people. The following example illustrates a problem that can arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 2(a).
       </b>
       T’s will devised “the residue of my estate to my descendants who survive me by representation.” T is survived by son S and daughter D. Son has two living children and D has one. S disclaims his interest. The disclaimed interest is one-half of the residuary estate, the interest S would have received had he not disclaimed. Section 2-1106(b)(3)(B) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(4)] provides that the disclaimed interest passes as if S had predeceased T. If Section 2-1106(b)(3) stopped there, S’s children would take one-half of the disclaimed interest and D would take the other half under Section 2-709 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1--09.1-09]. S’s disclaimer should not have that effect, however, but should pass what he would have taken to his children. Section 2- 1106(b)(3)(C) solves the problem. It provides that the entire disclaimed interest passes only to S’s descendants because they would share in the interest had S truly predeceased T.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provision also solves a problem that exists when the disclaimant is the only representative of an older generation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 2(b).
       </b>
       Assume the same facts as Example 2(a), but D has predeceased T. T is survived, therefore, by S, S’s two children, and D’s child. S disclaims. Again, the disclaimed interest is one-half of the residuary estate and it passes as if S had predeceased T. Had S actually predeceased T, the three grandchildren of S would have shared equally in T’s residuary estate because they are all in the same generation. Were the three grandchildren to share equally in the disclaimed interest, S’s two children would each receive one-third of the one-half while D’s child would receive one-third of the one-half in addition to the one-half of the residuary estate received as the representative of his or her late parent. Section 2-1106(b)(3)(C) again applies to insure that S’s children receive one-half of the residue, exactly the interest S would have received but for the disclaimer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The disclaimer of future interests created by will leads to a different problem. The effective date of the disclaimer of the future interest, the testator’s death, is earlier in time than the distribution date. This in turn leads to a possible anomaly illustrated by the following example.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 3.
       </b>
       Father’s will creates a testamentary trust for Mother who is to receive all the income for life. At her death, the trust is to be distributed to Father and Mother’s surviving descendants by representation. Mother is survived by son S and daughter D. Son has two living children and D has one. Son decides that he would prefer his share of the trust to pass to his children and disclaims. The disclaimer must be made within nine months of Father’s death if it is to be a qualified disclaimer for tax purposes. Under prior Acts and former Section 2-801 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-01, repealed], the interest would have passed as if Son had predeceased Father. A problem could arise if, at Mother’s death, one or more of S’s children living at that time were born after Father’s death. It would be possible to argue that had S predeceased Father the afterborn children would not exist and that D and S’s two children living at the time of Father’s death are entitled to all of the trust property.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem illustrated in Example 3 is solved by Section 2-1106(b)(3)(B). The disclaimed interest would have taken effect in possession or enjoyment, that is, Son would be entitled to receive one-half of the trust property, at Mother’s death. Under paragraph (3)(B) Son is deemed to have died immediately before Mother’s death even though under Section 2-1106(b)(1) the disclaimer is effective as of Father’s death. There is no doubt, therefore, that S’s children living at the distribution date, whenever born, are entitled to the share of the trust property S would have received and, as Examples 2(a) and 2(b) show, they will take exactly what S would have received but for the disclaimer. Had S actually died before Mother, he would have received nothing at Mother’s death whether or not the disclaimer had been made. There is nothing to pass to S’s children and they take as representatives of S under the representational scheme in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Future interests may or may not be conditioned on survivorship. The following examples illustrate disclaimers of future interests not expressly conditioned on survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 4(a).
       </b>
       G’s revocable trust directs the trustee to pay “ten thousand dollars ($10,000) to the grantor’s brother, B” at the termination of the trust on G’s death. B disclaims the entire gift immediately after G’s death. B is deemed to have predeceased G because it is at G’s death that the interest given B will come into possession and enjoyment. Had B not disclaimed he would have received $10,000 at that time. The recipient of the disclaimed interest will be determined by the law that applies to gifts of future interests to persons who die before the interest comes into possession and enjoyment. Traditional analysis would regard the gift to B as a vested interest subject to divestment by G’s power to revoke the trust. So long as G has not revoked the gift, the interest would pass through B’s estate to B’s successors in interest. Yet If B’s successors in interest are selected by B’s will, the disclaimer cannot be a qualified disclaimer for tax purposes. This problem does not arise in a jurisdiction with Section 2-707(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-07(2)], because the interest passes not through B’s estate but rather to B’s descendants who survive G by 120 hours by representation. Because the antilapse mechanism of Section 2-707 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-07] is not limited to gifts to relatives, a disclaimer by a friend rather than a brother would have the same result. For jurisdictions without Section 2-707, however, Section 2-1106(b)(3)(D) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(4)] provides an equivalent solution: a disclaimed interest that would otherwise pass through B’s estate instead passes to B’s descendants who survive G by representation.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 4(b).
       </b>
       G’s revocable trust directed that on his death the trust property is to be distributed to his three children, A, B, and C. A disclaims immediately after G’s death and is deemed to predecease the distribution date, which is G’s death. The traditional analysis applies exactly as it does in Example 4(a). The only condition on A’s gift would be G’s not revoking the trust. A is not explicitly required to survive G. (See First National Bank of Bar Harbor v. Anthony, 557 A.2d 957 (Me. 1989).) The interest would pass to A’s successors in interest. If those successors are selected by A’s will, the disclaimer cannot be a qualified disclaimer for tax purposes. Section 2-707(b) provides that A’s interest passes by representation to A’s descendants who survive G by 120 hours. For jurisdiction
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 4(c).
       </b>
       G conveys land “to A for life, remainder to B.” B disclaims immediately after the conveyance. Traditional analysis regards B’s remainder as vested; it is not contingent on surviving A. This classification is unaffected by whether or not the jurisdiction has adopted Section 2-707, because that section only applies to future interests in trust; it does not apply to future interests not in trust, such as the one in this example created directly in land. To the extent that B’s remainder is transmissible through B’s estate, B’s disclaimer cannot be a qualified disclaimer for tax purposes. Section 2-1106(b)(3)(D) resolves the problem: a disclaimed interest that would otherwise pass through B’s estate instead passes as if it were controlled by Sections 2-707 and 2-711 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09.1-11]. Because Section 2-707 only applies to future interests in trust, jurisdictions enacting Section 2-1106 should enact Section 2-1106(b)(3)(D) whether or not they have enacted Section 2-707.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-1106(b)(3)(A) provides a rule for the passing of property interests disclaimed by persons other than individuals. Because Section 2-1108 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-05] applies to disclaimers by trustees of property that would otherwise pass to the trust, Section 2-1106(b)(3)(A) principally applies to disclaimers by corporations, partnerships, and the other entities listed in the definition of “person” in Section 2-1102(6) [the definition of “person” is not included in North Dakota’s version]. A charity, for example, might wish to disclaim property the acceptance of which would be incompatible with its purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 2-1106(b)(4) [subsection (5)] continues the provision of prior Uniform Acts and former Section 2-801 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-01, repealed] on this subject providing for the acceleration of future interests on the making of the disclaimer, except that future interests in the disclaimant do not accelerate. The workings of Section 2-1106(b)(4) are illustrated by the following examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 5(a).
       </b>
       Father’s will creates a testamentary trust to pay income to his son S for his life, and on his death to pay the remainder to S’s descendants then living, by representation. If S disclaims his life income interest in the trust, he will be deemed to have died immediately before Father’s death. The disclaimed interest, S’s income interest, came into possession and enjoyment at Father’s death as would any present interest created by will (see Examples 1(a), (b), and (c)), and, therefore, the time of distribution is Father’s death. If at the income beneficiary of a testamentary trust does not survive the testator, the income interest is not created and the next interest in the trust takes effect. Since the next interest in Father’s trust is the remainder in S’s descendants, the trust property will pass to S’s descendants who survive Father by representation. It is immaterial under the statute that the actual situation at the S’s death might be different with different descendants entitled to the remainder.

       Mother’s will creates a testamentary trust to pay the income to her daughter D until she reaches age 35 at which time the trust is to terminate and the trust property distributed in equal shares to D and her three siblings. D disclaims her income interest. The remainder interests in her three siblings accelerate and they each receive one-fourth of the trust property. D’s remainder interest does not accelerate, however, and she must wait until she is 35 to receive her fourth of the trust property.

        Trial court did not err in holding that the granddaughters of a decedent’s half-sister inherited the intestate estate of the decedent because even though the decedent expressly excluded the half-sister under the will, it could not be inferred that the decedent intended to exclude the granddaughters; the residuary of the estate was to pass as though the half-sister disclaimed the intestate share under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-10.1-03(4).

       The various forms of ownership in which “joint property,” as defined in Section 2-1102(5) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-01(8)], can be held include common law joint tenancies and any statutory variation that preserves the right of survivorship. The common law was unsettled whether a surviving joint tenant had any right to renounce his interest in jointly-owned property and if so to what extent. See Casner, Estate Planning, 5th ed. § 10.7. Specifically, if A and B owned real estate or securities as joint tenants with right of survivorship and A died, the problem was whether B might disclaim what was given to him originally upon creation of the estate, or, if not, whether he could nevertheless reject the incremental portion derived through the right of survivorship. There was also a question of whether a joint bank account should be treated differently from jointly-owned securities or real estate for the purpose of disclaimer.
      </p>
      <p>
       This common law of disclaimers of jointly held property must be set against the rapid developments in the law of tax qualified disclaimers of jointly held property. Since the previous Uniform Acts were drafted, the law regarding tax qualified disclaimers of joint property interests has been clarified. Courts have repeatedly held that a surviving joint tenant may disclaim that portion of the jointly held property to which the survivor succeeds by operation of law on the death of the other joint tenant so long as the joint tenancy was severable during the life of the joint tenants (Kennedy v. Commissioner, 804 F.2d 1332 (7th Cir. 1986), McDonald v. Commissioner, 853 F.2d 1494 (9th Cir. 1988), Dancy v. Commissioner, 872 F.2d 84 (4th Cir. 1989).) On December 30, 1997 the Service published T.D. 8744 making final proposed amendments of the Regulations under IRC § 2518 to reflect the decisions regarding disclaimers of joint property interests.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amended final Regulations, § 25.2518-2(c)(4)(i) allow a surviving joint tenant or tenant by the entireties to disclaim that portion of the tenancy to which he or she succeeds upon the death of the first joint tenant (1/2 where there are two joint tenants) whether or not the tenancy could have been unilaterally severed under local law and regardless of the proportion of consideration furnished by the disclaimant. The Regulations also create a special rule for joint tenancies between spouses created after July 14, 1988 where the spouse of the donor is not a United States citizen. In that case, the donee spouse may disclaim any portion of the joint tenancy includible in the donor spouse’s gross estate under IRC § 2040, which creates a contribution rule. Thus the surviving non-citizen spouse may disclaim all of the joint tenancy property if the deceased spouse provided all the consideration for the tenancy’s creation.
      </p>
      <p>
       These developments in the tax law of disclaimers are reflected in subsection (a) [subsection (1)]. The subsection allows a surviving holder of jointly held property to disclaim the greater of the accretive share, the part of the jointly held property which augments the survivor’s interest in the property, and all of the property that it not attributable to the disclaimant’s contribution to the jointly held property. In the usual joint tenancy or tenancy by the entireties between husband and wife, the survivor will always be able to disclaim one-half the property. If the disclaimer conforms to the requirements of IRC § 2518, it will be a qualified disclaimer. In addition the surviving spouse can disclaim all of the property attributable to the decedent’s contribution, a provision which will allow the non-citizen spouse to take advantage of the contribution rule of the final Regulations. The contribution rule of subsection (a)(2) [subsection (1), 2nd cl.] will also allow surviving holders of joint property arrangements other than joint tenancies to make a tax qualified disclaimer under the rules applicable to those joint arrangements. For example, if A contributes 60% and B contributes 40% to a joint bank account and they allow the interest on the funds to accumulate, on B’s death A can disclaim 40% of the account; on A’s death B can disclaim 60% of the account. (Note that under subsection (a)(1) A can disclaim up to 50% of the account on B’s death because there are two joint account holders, but the disclaimer would not be fully tax qualified. As previously noted, a tax qualified disclaimer is limited to 40% of the account.) If the account belonged to the parties during their joint lives in proportion to their contributions, the disclaimers in this example can be tax qualified disclaimers if all the requirements of IRC § 2518 are met.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [subsection (2)] provides that the disclaimer is effective as of the death of the joint holder which triggers the survivorship feature of the joint property arrangement. The disclaimant, therefore, has no interest in and has not transferred the disclaimed interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) [subsection (3)] provides that the disclaimed interest passes as if the disclaimant had predeceased the holder to whose death the disclaimer relates. Where there are two joint holders, a disclaimer by the survivor results in the disclaimed property passing as part of the deceased joint holder’s estate because under this subsection, the deceased joint holder is the survivor as to the portion disclaimed. If a married couple owns the family home in joint tenancy, therefore, a disclaimer by the survivor under subsection (a)(1) results in one-half the home passing through the decedent’s estate. The surviving spouse and whoever receives the interest through the decedent’s estate are tenants in common in the house. In the proper circumstances, the disclaimed one-half could help to use up the decedent’s unified credit. Without the disclaimer, the interest would automatically qualify for the marital deduction, perhaps wasting part of the decedent’s applicable exclusion amount.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a multiple holder joint property arrangement, the disclaimed interest will belong to the other joint holder or holders.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 1.
       </b>
       A, B, and C make equal contributions to the purchase of Blackacre, to which they take title as joint tenants with right of survivorship. On partition each would receive 1/3 of Blackacre and any of them could convert his or her interest to a 1/3 tenancy in common by unilateral severance (which, of course, would have to be accomplished in accordance with state law). On A’s death, B and C may each, if they wish, disclaim up to 1/3 of the property under section (a)(1). Should one of them disclaim the full 1/3, the disclaimant will be deemed to predecease A.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assume that B so disclaims. With respect to the 1/3 undivided interest that now no longer belongs to A the only surviving joint holder is C. C therefore owns that 1/3 as tenant in common with the joint tenancy. Should C predecease B, the 1/3 tenancy in common interest will pass through C’s estate and B will be the sole owner of an undivided 2/3 interest in Blackacre as the survivor of the joint tenancy. Should B predecease C, C will be the sole owner of Blackacre in fee simple absolute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, assume that both B and C make valid disclaimers after A’s death. They are both deemed to predeceased A, A is the sole survivor of the joint tenancy and Blackacre passes through A’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, assume that A provided all the consideration for the purchase of Blackacre. On A’s death, B and C can each disclaim the entire property under subsection (a)(2). If they both do so, Blackacre will pass through A’s estate. If only one of B or C disclaims the entire property, the one who does not will be the sole owner of Blackacre as the only surviving joint tenant. Such a disclaimer would not be completely tax qualified, however. The Regulations limit a tax qualified disclaimer to no more than 1/3 of the property. If, however, B or C were the first to die, A could still disclaim the 1/3 interest that no longer belongs to the decedent under subsection (a)(1), the disclaimer would be a qualified disclaimer for tax purposes under the Regulations, and the result is that the other surviving joint tenant owns 1/3 of Blackacre as tenant in common with the joint tenancy.

       This section deals with disclaimer of a right to receive property into a trust, and thus applies only to trustees. (A disclaimer of a right to receive property by a fiduciary acting on behalf of an individual, such as a personal representative, conservator, guardian, or agent is governed by the section of the statute applicable to the type of interest being disclaimed.) The instrument under which the right to receive the property was created may govern the disposition of the property in the event of a disclaimer by providing for a disposition when the trust does not exist. When the instrument does not make such a provision, the doctrine of resulting trust will carry the property back to the donor. The effect of the actions of cotrustees will depend on the state law governing the action of multiple trustees. Every disclaimer by a trustee must be compatible with the trustee’s fiduciary obligations.

       Section 2-1105(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-02(1)] authorizes a person to disclaim an interest in or power over property. Section 2-1109 [this section] provides rules for disclaimers of powers which are not held in a fiduciary capacity. The most common non-fiduciary power is a power of appointment. Section 2-1105(a) also authorizes the partial disclaimer of a power as well as of an interest. For example, the disclaimer could be of a portion of the power to appoint one’s self, while retaining the right to appoint to others. The effect of a disclaimer of a power under Section 2-1109 depends on whether or not the holder has exercised the power and on what sort of power is held. If a holder disclaims a power before exercising it, the power expires and can never be exercised. If the power has been exercised, the power is construed as having expired immediately after its last exercise by the holder. The disclaimer affects only the holder of the power and will not affect other aspects of the power.
      </p>
      <p>

       </b>
       T creates a testamentary trust to pay the income to A for life, remainder as A shall appoint by will among her descendants living at A’s death and four named charities. If A does not exercise her power, the remainder passes to her descendants living at her death by representation. A disclaims the power. The power can no longer be exercised and on A’s death the remainder will pass to the takers in default.

      <p>
       This section governs disclaimers by those who may or do receive an interest in property through the exercise of a power of appointment. At the time of the creation of a power of appointment, the creator of the power, besides giving the power to the holder of the power, can also limit the objects of the power (the permissible appointees of the property subject to the power) and also name those who are to take if the power is not exercised, persons referred to as takers in default.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provides rules for disclaimers by all of these persons: subsection (a) [subsection (1)] is concerned with a disclaimer by a person who actually receives an interest in property through the exercise of a power of appointment, and subsection (b) [subsection (2)] recognizes a disclaimer by a taker in default or permissible appointee before the power is exercised. These two situations are quite different. An appointee is in the same position as any devisee or beneficiary of a trust. He or she may receive a present or future interest depending on how the holder of the power exercises it. Subsection (a) therefore, makes the disclaimer effective as of the time the instrument exercising the power—giving the interest to the disclaimant—becomes irrevocable. If the holder of the power created an interest in the appointee, the effect of the disclaimer is governed by Section 2-1106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03]. If the holder created another power in the appointee, the effect of the disclaimer is governed by Section 2-1109 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-06].
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 1.
       </b>
       Mother’s will creates a testamentary trust for daughter D. The trustees are to pay all income to D for her life and have discretion to invade principal for D’s maintenance. On D’s death she may appoint the trust property by will among her then living descendants. In default of appointment the property is to be distributed by representation to D’s descendants who survive her. D is the donee, her descendants are the permissible appointees and the takers in default. D exercises her power by appointing the trust property in three equal shares to her children A, B, and C. The three children are the appointees. A disclaims. Under subsection (a) A’s disclaimer is effective as of D’s death (the time at which the will exercising the power became irrevocable). Because A disclaimed an interest in property, the effect of the disclaimer is governed by Section 2-1106(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(2) and (3)]. If D’s will makes no provisions for the disposition of the interest should it be disclaimed or of disclaimed interests in general (Section 2-1106(b)(2) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(3)]), the interest passes as if A predeceased the time of distribution which is D’s death. An appointment to a person who is dead at the time of the appointment is ineffective except as provided by an antilapse statute. See Restatement, Second, Property (Donative Transfers) § 18.5. The Restatement, Second, Property (Donative Transfers), § 18.6 suggests that any requirement of the antilapse statute that the deceased devisee be related in some way to the testator be applied as if the appointive property were owned either by the donor or the holder of the power. (See also Restatement, Third, Property (Wills and Other Donative Transfers) § 5.5, Comment l.) That is the position taken by Section 2-603 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-09-05]. Since antilapse statutes usually apply to devises to children and grandchildren, the disclaimed interest would pass to A’s descendants by representation.

       A taker in default or a permissible object of appointment is traditionally regarded as having a type of future interest. See Restatement, Second, Property (Donative Transfers) § 11.2, Comments c and d. The future interest will come into possession and enjoyment when the question of whether or not the power is to be exercised is resolved. For testamentary powers that time is the death of the holder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [subsection (2)] provides that a disclaimer by an object or taker in default takes effect as of the time the instrument creating the power becomes effective. Because the disclaimant is disclaiming an interest in property, albeit a future interest, the effect of the disclaimer is governed by Section 2-1106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03]. The effect of these rules is illustrated by the following examples.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 2(a).
       </b>
       The facts are the same as Example 1, except A disclaims before D’s death and D’s will does not exercise the power. Under subsection (b) A’s disclaimer is effective as of Mother’s death which is the time when the instrument creating the power, Mother’s will, became irrevocable. Because A disclaimed an interest in property, the effect of the disclaimer is governed by Section 2-1106(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(2) and (3)]. If Mother’s will makes no provision for the disposition of the interest should it be disclaimed or of disclaimed interests in general (Section 2-1106(b)(2) [N.D.C.C. 30.1-10.1-03(3)]), the interest passes and under Section 2-1106(b)(3) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-03(4)] as if the disclaimant had died immediately before the time of distribution. Thus, A is deemed to have died immediately before D’s death which is the time of distribution. If A actually survives D, the disclaimed interest is one-third of the trust property; it will pass as if A predeceased D, and the result is the same as in Example 1. If A does predecease D he would have received nothing and there is no disclaimed interest. The disclaimer has no effect on the passing of the trust property.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example 2(b).
       </b>
       The facts are the same as in Example 2(a) except D does exercise her power of appointment to give one-third of the trust property to each of her three children, A, B, and C. A’s disclaimer means the disclaimed interest will pass as if he predeceased D and the result is the same as in Example 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, if all the objects and takers in default disclaim before the power is exercised the power of appointment is destroyed. See Restatement, Second, Property (Donative Transfers) § 12.1, Comment g.

      <p>
       This section governs disclaimers by fiduciaries of powers held in their fiduciary capacity. Examples include a right to remove and replace a trustee or a trustee’s power to make distributions of income or principal. Such disclaimers have not been specifically dealt with in prior Uniform Acts although they could prove useful in several situations. A trustee who is also a beneficiary may want to disclaim a power to invade principal for himself for tax purposes. A trustee of a trust for the benefit for a surviving spouse who also has the power to invade principal for the decedent’s descendants may wish to disclaim the power in order to qualify the trust for the marital deduction. (The use of a disclaimer in just that situation was approved in Cleaveland v. U.S., 62 A.F.T.R.2d 88-5992, 88-1 USTC ¶13,766 (C. D. Ill. 1988).)
      </p>
      <p>
       The section refers to fiduciary in the singular. It is possible, of course, for a trust to have two or more co-trustees and an estate to have two or more co-personal representatives. This Act leaves the effect of actions of multiple fiduciaries to the general rules in effect in each State relating to multiple fiduciaries. For example, if the general rule is that a majority of trustees can make binding decisions, a disclaimer by two of three co-trustees of a power is effective. A dissenting co-trustee could follow whatever procedure state law prescribes for disassociating him or herself from the action of the majority. A sole trustee burdened with a power to invade principal for a group of beneficiaries including him or herself who wishes to disclaim the power but yet preserve the possibility of another trustee exercising the power would seek the appointment of a disinterested co-trustee to exercise the power and then disclaim the power for him or herself. The subsection thus makes the disclaimer effective only as to the disclaiming fiduciary unless the disclaimer states otherwise. If the disclaimer does attempt to bind other fiduciaries, be they cofiduciaries or successor fiduciaries, the effect of the disclaimer will depend on local law.
      </p>
      <p>
       As with any action by a fiduciary, a disclaimer of fiduciary powers must be compatible with the fiduciary’s duties.

For example, a disclaimer of an interest in an decedent’s estate must be delivered to the personal representative of the estate.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1978 Act required that an effective disclaimer be made within nine months of the event giving rise to the right to disclaim (e.g., nine months from the death of the decedent or donee of a power or the vesting of a future interest). The nine month period corresponded in some situations with the Internal Revenue Code provisions governing qualified tax disclaimers. Under the common law an effective disclaimer had to be made only within a “reasonable” time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Act specifically rejects a time requirement for making a disclaimer. Recognizing that disclaimers are used for purposes other than tax planning, a disclaimer can be made effectively under the Act so long as the disclaimant is not barred from disclaiming the property or interest or has not waived the right to disclaim. Persons seeking to make tax qualified disclaimers will continue to have to conform to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       The events resulting in a bar to the right to disclaim set forth in this section are similar to those found in the 1978 Acts and former Section 2-801 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-01, repealed]. Subsection (a) [subsection (1)] provides that a written waiver of the right to disclaim is effective to bar a disclaimer. Such a waiver might be sought, for example, by a creditor who wishes to make sure that property acquired in the future will be available to satisfy the debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether particular actions by the disclaimant amount to accepting the interest sought to be disclaimed within the meaning of subsection (b)(1) [subsection (2), 1st cl.] will necessarily be determined by the courts based upon the particular facts. (See Leipham v. Adams, 77 Wash. App. 827, 894 P.2d 576 (1995); Matter of Will of Hall, 318 S.C. 188, 456 S.E.2d 439 (Ct. App. 1995); Jordan v. Trower, 208 Ga. App. 552, 431 S.E.2d 160 (1993); Matter of Gates, 189 A.D.2d 427, 595 N.Y.S.2d 194 (3d Dept. 1993); “What Constitutes or Establishes Beneficiary’s Acceptance or Renunciation of Devise or Bequest,” 93 ALR2d 8).
      </p>
      <p>
       The addition in this Act of the word “voluntary” to the list of actions barring a disclaimer which also appears in the earlier Acts reflects the numerous cases holding that only actions by the disclaimant taken after the right to disclaim has arisen will act as a bar. (See Troy v. Hart, 116 Md. App. 468, 697 A.2d 113 (1997), Estate of Opatz, 554 N.W.2d 813 (N.D. 1996), Frances Slocum Bank v. Martin, 666 N.E.2d 411 (Ind. App. 1996), Brown v. Momar, Inc., 201 Ga. App. 542, 411 S.E.2d 718 (1991), Tompkins State Bank v. Niles, 127 Ill.2d 209, 130 Ill. Dec. 207, 537 N.E.2d 274 (1989).) An existing lien, therefore, will not prevent a disclaimer, although the disclaimant’s actions before the right to disclaim arises may work an estoppel. See Hale v. Bardouh, 975 S.W.2d 419 (Tex. Ct. App. 1998). With regard to joint property, the event giving rise to the right to disclaim is the death of a joint holder, not the creation of the joint interest and any benefit received during the deceased joint tenant’s life is ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to judicial sale in subsection (b)(3) [subsection (2), 3rd cl.] continues a provision from the earlier Acts and ensures that title gained from a judicial sale by a personal representative will not be clouded by a possible disclaimer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) rephrases the rules of Section 2-1111 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-08] governing the effect of disclaimers of powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) [subsection (4)] is applicable to powers which can be disclaimed under Section 2-1109 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-06]. It bars the disclaimer of a general power of appointment once it has been exercised. A general power of appointment allows the holder to take the property subject to the power for him or herself, whether outright or by using it to pay his or her creditors (for estate and gift tax purposes, a general power is one that allows the holder to appoint to himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate). The power is presently exercisable if the holder need not wait to some time or for some event to occur before exercising the power. If the holder has exercised such a power, it can no longer be disclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (e) [subsection (5)], unlike the 1978 Act, specifies that “other law” may bar the right to disclaim. Some States, including Minnesota (M.S.A. § 525.532 (c)(6)), Massachusetts (Mass. Gen. Law c. 191A, § 8), and Florida (Fla. Stat. § 732.801(6)), bar a disclaimer by an insolvent disclaimant. In others a disclaimer by an insolvent debtor is treated as a fraudulent “transfer”. See Stein v. Brown, 18 Ohio St. 3d 305 (1985); Pennington v. Bigham, 512 So.2d 1344 (Ala. 1987). A number of States refuse to recognize a disclaimer used to qualify the disclaimant for Medicaid or other public assistance. These decisions often rely on the definition of “transfer” in the federal Medical Assistance Handbook which includes a “waiver” of the right to receive an inheritance (see 42 U.S.C.A. § 1396p(e)(1)). See Hinschberger v. Griggs County Social Services, 499 N.W.2d 876 (N.D. 1993); Department of Income Maintenance v. Watts, 211 Conn. 323 (1989), Matter of Keuning, 190 A.D.2d 1033, 593 N.Y.S.2d 653 (4th Dept. 1993), and Matter of Molloy, 214 A.D.2d 171, 631 N.Y.S.2d 910 (2nd Dept. 1995), Troy v. Hart, 116 Md. App. 468, 697 A.2d 113 (1997), Tannler v. Wisconsin Dept. of Health &amp; Social Services, 211 Wis. 2d 179, 564 N.W.2d 735 (1997); but see, Estate of Kirk, 591 N.W.2d 630 (Iowa, 1999)(valid disclaimer by executor of surviving spouse who was Medicaid beneficiary prevents recovery by Medicaid authorities). It is also likely that state policies will begin to address the question of disclaimers of real property on which an environmental hazard is located in order to avoid saddling the State, as title holder of last resort, with the resulting liability, although the need for fiduciaries to disclaim property subject to environmental liability has probably been diminished by the 1996 amendments to CERCLA by the Asset Conservation Act of 1996 (PL 104-208). These larger policy issues are not addressed in this Act and must, therefore, continue to be addressed by the various States. On the federal level, the United States Supreme Court has held that valid disclaimer does not defeat a federal tax lien levied under IRC § 6321, Dyre, Jr. v. United States, 528 U.S. 49, 120 S. Ct. 474 (1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (f) [subsection (6)] provides a rule stating what happens if an attempt is made to disclaim a power or property interest whose disclaimer is barred by this section. A disclaimer of a power is ineffective, but the attempted disclaimer of the property interest, although invalid as a disclaimer, will operate as a transfer of the disclaimed property interest to the person or persons who would have taken the interest had the disclaimer not been barred. This provision removes the ambiguity that would otherwise be caused by an ineffective refusal to accept property. Whoever has control of the property will know to whom to deliver it and the person attempting the disclaimer will bear any transfer tax consequences. [North Dakota’s provision includes as subsection (7) a paragraph not included in the UPC.]

       This section permits the recordation of a disclaimer of an interest in property ownership of or title to which is the subject of a recording system. This section expands on the corresponding provision of previous Uniform Acts which only referred to permissive recording of a disclaimer of an interest in real property. While local practice may vary, disclaimants should realize that in order to establish the chain of title to real property, and to ward off creditors and bona fide purchasers, the disclaimer may have to be recorded. This section does not change the law of the state governing notice.

       [Section 2-1116 is adopted as subsection (3) of this section. Comment to 2-1116] This section deals with the application of the Act to existing interests and powers. It insures that disclaimers barred by the running of a time period under prior law will not be revived by the Act. For example, assume prior law, like the prior Acts and former Section 2-801 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10-01, repealed], allows the disclaimer of present interests within nine months of their creation and the disclaimer of future interests nine months after they are indefeasibly vested. Under T’s will, X receives an outright devise of a sum of money and also has a contingent remainder in a trust created under the will. The Act is effective in the jurisdiction governing the administration of T’s estate ten months after T’s death. X cannot disclaim the general devise, irrespective of the application of Section 2-1113 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-10], because the nine months allowed under prior law have run. The contingent remainder, however, may be disclaimed so long as it is not barred under Section 2-1113 without regard to the nine month period of prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Section 2-1117 is adopted as subsection (4) of this section. Comment to 2-1117] This section adopts standard language approved by the Uniform Law Conference that is intended to preempt application of the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act of 2000 (E-Sign). Section 102(a)(2)(B) of that Act provides that the federal law can be preempted by a later statute of the State that specifically refers to the federal law. Not subject to preemption by the states are E-Sign’s consumer consent provisions (Section 101(c)) and its notice provisions (Section 103(b)), neither of which have substantive impact on the Disclaimers Act. The effect of this Section is to reaffirm state authority over the formal requirements for the making of a disclaimer. For these requirements, see Section 2-1105 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-02], and, specifically, Section 2-1105(c) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-10.1-02(4)], which allow a disclaimer to be made by means of a signed record.

     <p>
      A will may be deposited by the testator or the testator’s agent with a recorder for safekeeping. The will must be sealed and kept confidential. During the testator’s lifetime, a deposited will must be delivered only to the testator or to a person authorized in a writing signed by the testator to receive the will. A conservator may be allowed to examine a deposited will of a protected testator under procedures designed to maintain the confidential character of the document to the extent possible, and to ensure that it will be resealed and kept on deposit after the examination. Upon being informed of the testator’s death, the recorder shall notify any person designated to receive the will and deliver it to that person on request or the recorder may deliver the will to the appropriate court.

      <p>
       Many states already have statutes permitting deposit of wills during a testator’s lifetime. Most of these statutes have elaborate provisions governing purely administrative matters: how the will is to be enclosed in a sealed wrapper, what is to be endorsed on the wrapper, the form of receipt or certificate given to the testator, the fee to be charged, how the will is to be opened after testator’s death, and who is to be notified. Under this section, details have been left to court rule, except as other relevant statutes such as one governing fees may apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is, of course, vital to maintain the confidential nature of deposited wills. However, this obviously does not prevent the opening of the will after the death of the testator if necessary in order to determine the executor or other interested persons to be notified. Nor should it prevent opening the will to microfilm for confidential record storage, for example. These matters could again be regulated by court rule.

    </p>
    <p>
     The provisions of this Article describe the Flexible System of Administration of Decedents’ Estates. Designed to be applicable to both intestate and testate estates and to provide persons interested in decedents’ estates with as little or as much by way of procedural and adjudicative safeguards as may be suitable under varying circumstances, this system is the heart of the Uniform Probate Code.
    </p>
    <p>
     The organization and detail of the system here described may be expressed in varying ways and some states may see fit to reframe parts of this Article to better accommodate local institutions. Variations in language from state to state can be tolerated without loss of the essential purposes of procedural uniformity and flexibility, if the following essential characteristics are carefully protected in the re-drafting process:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol11">
      Postmortem probate of a will must occur to make a will effective and appointment of a personal representative by a public official after the decedent’s death is required in order to create the duties and powers attending the office of personal representative. Neither are compelled, however, but are left to be obtained by persons having an interest in the consequence of probate or appointment. Estates descend at death to successors identified by any probated will, or to heirs if no will is probated, subject to rights which may be implemented through administration.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol12">
      Two methods of securing probate of wills which include a non-adjudicative determination (informal probate) on the one hand, and a judicial determination after notice to all interested persons (formal probate) on the other, are provided.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol13">
      Two methods of securing appointment of a personal representative which include appointment without notice and without final adjudication of matters relevant to priority for appointment (informal appointment), on the one hand, and appointment by judicial order after notice to interested persons (formal appointment) on the other, are provided.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol14">
      A five-day waiting period from death preventing informal probate or informal appointment of any but a special administrator is required.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol15">
      Probate of a will by informal or formal proceedings or an adjudication of intestacy may occur without any attendant requirement of appointment of a personal representative.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol16">
      One judicial, in rem, proceeding encompassing formal probate of any wills (or a determination after notice that the decedent left no will), appointment of a personal representative, and complete settlement of an estate under continuing supervision of the court (supervised administration) is provided for testators and persons interested in a decedent’s estate, whether testate or intestate, who desire to use it.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol17">
      Unless supervised administration is sought and ordered, persons interested in estates (including personal representatives, whether appointed informally or after notice) may use an “in and out” relationship to the court so that any question or assumption relating to the estate, including the status of an estate as testate or intestate, matters relating to one or more claims, disputed titles, accounts of personal representatives, and distribution, may be resolved or established by adjudication after notice without necessarily subjecting the estate to the necessity of judicial orders in regard to other or further questions or assumptions.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol18">
      The status of a decedent in regard to whether he left a valid will or died intestate must be resolved by adjudication after notice in proceedings commenced within three years after his death. If not so resolved, any will probated informally becomes final, and if there is no such probate, the status of the decedent as intestate is finally determined, by a statute of limitations which bars probate and appointment unless requested within three years after death.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol19">
      Personal representatives appointed informally or after notice, and whether supervised or not, have statutory powers enabling them to collect, protect, sell, distribute, and otherwise handle all steps in administration without further order of the court, except that supervised personal representatives may be subjected to special restrictions on power as endorsed on their letters.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol110">
      Purchasers from personal representatives and from distributees of personal representatives are protected so that adjudications regarding the testacy status of a decedent or any other question going to the propriety of a sale are not required in order to protect purchasers.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol111">
      Provisions protecting a personal representative who distributes without adjudication are included to make non-adjudicated settlements feasible.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1aIIIol112">
      Statutes of limitation bar creditors of the decedent who fail to present claims within four months after legal advertising of the administration and unsecured claims not previously barred by nonclaim statutes are barred after three years from the decedent’s death.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     Overall, the system accepts the premise that the court’s role in regard to probate and administration, and its relationship to personal representatives who derive their power from public appointment, is wholly passive until some interested person invokes its power to secure resolution of a matter. The state, through the court, should provide remedies which are suitable and efficient to protect any and all rights regarding succession, but should refrain from intruding into family affairs unless relief is requested, and limit its relief to that sought.

        Because the estate had insufficient liquid assets to pay the estate taxes without resorting to royalty payments, the district court did not err in finding an implied trust and in ordering the proceeds from life insurance policies to be applied to the estate tax obligation; the testator's children had equal ownership interests in the royalty payments upon her death, subject to administration, and they were entitled to the income from the royalty interests during the administration.

Additionally, N.D.C.C. § 59-04.1-05(2)(a) [repealed] provides that devisees of specific property are entitled to income earned from that property during the administration of the estate. Stratton v.

        Title to property passes to a decedent's heirs or devisees at death, subject to a personal representative's broad powers over the title for administration purposes; a personal representative is allowed to lease and sell estate property if acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons. Therefore, although a personal representative might have been acting reasonably when she leased farmland, an income-producing asset of the estate, there was insufficient analysis or supporting evidence presented on the issue.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic idea of this section follows section 85 of the Model Probate Code. The exception referring to section 30.1-23-01 relates to affidavit procedures which are authorized for collection of estates worth less than $5,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 30.1-12-07 and various sections in chapters 30.1-14 and 30.1-15 of this Article make it clear that a will may be probated without appointment of a personal representative, including any nominated by the will.
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement of probate stated here and the limitations on probate provided in section 30.1-12-08 mean that questions as to testacy may be eliminated simply by the running of time. Under these sections, an informally probated will cannot be questioned after the later of three years from the decedent’s death or one year from the probate whether or not an executor was appointed, or, if an executor was appointed, without regard to whether the estate has been distributed. If the decedent is believed to have died without a will, the running of three years from death bars probate of a late-discovered will and so makes the assumption of intestacy conclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exceptions to the section (other than the exception relevant to small estates) are not intended to accommodate cases of late-discovered wills. Rather, they are designed to make the probate requirement inapplicable where circumstances led survivors of a decedent to believe that there was no point to probating a will of which they may have had knowledge. If any will was probated within three years of death, or if letters of administration were issued in this period, the exceptions to the section are inapplicable. If there has been no proceeding in probate, persons seeking to establish title by an unprobated will must show, with reference to the estate they claim, either that it has been possessed by those to whom it was devised or that it has been unknown to the decedent’s heirs or devisees and not possessed by any.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is to be noted, also, that devisees who are able to claim under one of the exceptions to this section may not obtain probate of the will or administration of the estate to assist them in their efforts to obtain the estate in question. The exceptions are to a rule which bars admission of a will into evidence, rather than to the section barring late probate and late appointment of personal representatives. Still, the exceptions should serve to prevent two “hard” cases which can be imagined readily. In one, a surviving spouse fails to seek probate of a will, giving her the entire estate of the decedent because she is informed or believes that all of her husband’s property was held by them jointly, with right of survivorship. Later, it is discovered that she was mistaken as to the nature of her husband’s title. The other case involves a devisee who sees no point to securing probate of a will in his favor because he is unaware of any estate. Subsequently, valuable rights of the decedent are discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1993, a technical amendment removed a two-pronged exception formerly occupying about 8 lines of text in the official text. The removed language permitted unprobated wills to be admitted in evidence in two limited categories of cases in which failure to probate a will within three years of the testator’s death were deemed to be justified. The 1993 technical amendment to 3-108 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-12-08] so limits the three year time bar on probate and appointment proceedings as to make the 3-102 [this section’s] exception unnecessary.

       This section makes it clear that appointment by a public official is required before one can acquire the status of personal representative. “Qualification” is dealt with in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-01" target="_self">30.1-17-01</a></cite>. “Letters” are the subject of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-02s30.1-02-05" target="_self">30.1-02-05</a></cite>.

      No proceeding to enforce a claim against the estate of a decedent or the decedent’s successors may be revived or commenced before the appointment of a personal representative. After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by chapters 30.1-12 through 30.1-23. After distribution, a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in section 30.1-21-04 or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-05" target="_self">30.1-21-05</a></cite>.

       This and sections of chapter 30.1-19, Article III, are designed to force creditors of decedents to assert their claims against duly appointed personal representatives. Creditors of a decedent are interested persons who may seek the appointment of a personal representative (section 30.1-14-01). If no appointment is granted to another within 45 days after decedent’s death, a creditor may be eligible to be appointed if other persons with priority decline to serve or are ineligible (section 30.1-13-03). But, if a personal representative has been appointed and has closed the estate under circumstances which leave a creditor’s claim unbarred, the creditor is permitted to enforce his claims against distributees, as well as against the personal representative if any duty owed to creditors under section 30.1-19-07 or 30.1-21-03 has been breached. The methods for closing estates are outlined in sections 30.1-21-01 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-03" target="_self">30.1-21-03</a></cite>. Termination of appointment under section 30.1-17-08 et seq. may occur though the estate is not closed and so may be irrelevant to the question of whether creditors may pursue distributees.

     <p>
      Persons interested in decedents’ estates may apply to the court for determination in the informal proceedings provided in chapters 30.1-12 through 30.1-23 and may petition the court for orders in formal proceedings within the court’s jurisdiction, including those described in chapters 30.1-12 through 30.1-23. The court has exclusive jurisdiction of formal proceedings to determine how decedents’ estates subject to the laws of this state are to be administered, expended, and distributed, including actions to determine title to property alleged to belong to the estate and of any action or proceeding in which property distributed by a personal representative or its value is sought to be subjected to rights of creditors or successors of the decedent.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This and other sections of Article III contemplate a nonjudicial officer who will act on informal application and a judge who will hear and decide formal petitions. See section 30.1-02-06 which permits the judge to perform or delegate the functions of the court. However, the primary purpose of Article III is to describe functions to be performed by various public officials, rather than to prescribe how these responsibilities should be assigned within a given state or county. Hence, any of several alternatives to the organizational scheme assumed for purposes of this draft would be acceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
       If separate courts or offices are not feasible, it may be preferable to concentrate authority for allocating responsibility respecting formal and informal proceedings in the judge. To do so helps fix responsibility for the total operation of the office. This is the assumption of this draft.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be up to each adopting state to select the organizational arrangement which best meets its needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the office with jurisdiction to hear and decide formal petitions is the county or district court of general jurisdiction, there will be little basis for objection to the broad statement of concurrent jurisdiction of this section. However, if a more specialized “estates” court is used, there may be pressure to prevent it from hearing negligence and other actions involving jury trials, even though it may be given unlimited power to decide other cases to which a personal representative is a party. A system for certifying matters involving jury trials to the general trial court could be provided, although the alternative of permitting the estates court to empanel juries where necessary might not be unworkable. In any event, the jurisdiction of the “estates” or “probate” court in regard to negligence litigation would only be concurrent with that of the general trial court. The important point is that the estates court, whatever it is called, should have unlimited power to hear and finally dispose of all matters relevant to determination of the extent of the decedent’s estate and of the claims against it. The jury trial question is peripheral.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the Comment to the next section regarding adjustments which might be made in the Code by a state with a single court of general jurisdiction for each county or district.

       The language in this and the preceding section which divides matters coming before the probate court between those within the court’s “exclusive” jurisdiction and those within its “concurrent” jurisdiction would be inappropriate if probate matters were assigned to a branch of a single court of general jurisdiction. The Code could be adjusted to an assumption of a single court in various ways. Any adjusted version should contain a provision permitting the court to hear and settle certain kinds of matters after notice as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-01" target="_self">30.1-03-01</a></cite>. It might be suitable to combine the second sentence of section 30.1-12-05 and section 30.1-12-06 into a single section as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “The court may hear and determine formal proceedings involving administration and distribution of decedents’ estates after notice to interested persons in conformity with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-01" target="_self">30.1-03-01</a></cite>. Persons notified are bound though less than all interested persons may have been given notice.”
      </p>
      <p>
       An adjusted version also might provide:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Subject to general rules concerning the proper location of civil litigation and jurisdiction of persons, the court (meaning the probate division) may hear and determine any other controversy concerning a succession or to which an estate, through a personal representative, may be a party.” The propriety of this sort of statement would depend upon whether questions of docketing and assignment, including the division of matters between coordinate branches of the court, should be dealt with by legislation.

       The Joint Editorial Board, in 1975, recommended the addition after “rule”, of the language “and in proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs which concern estates that have not been and cannot now be opened for administration.” This addition, coupled with the exceptions to the limitations provisions in Section 3-108 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-12-08] that permit proceedings to construe wills and to determine heirs of intestates to be commenced more than three years after death, clarifies the purpose of the draftsmen to offer a probate proceeding to aid the determination of rights of inheritance of estates that were not opened for administration within the time permitted by Section 3-108 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-12-08].

      Unless supervised administration as described in chapter 30.1-16 is involved, each proceeding before the court is independent of any other proceeding involving the same estate. Petitions for formal orders of the court may combine various requests for relief in a single proceeding if the orders sought may be finally granted without delay. Except as required for proceedings which are particularly described by other sections of chapters 30.1-12 through 30.1-23, no petition is defective because it fails to embrace all matters which might then be the subject of a final order, proceedings for probate of wills or adjudications of no will may be combined with proceedings for appointment of personal representatives, and a proceeding for appointment of personal representative is concluded by an order making or declining the appointment.

       This section and others in Article III describe a system of administration of decedents’ estates which gives interested persons control of whether matters relating to estates will become occasions for judicial orders. Sections 30.1-16-01 through 30.1-16-05 describe supervised administration, a judicial proceeding which is continuous throughout administration. It corresponds with the theory of administration of decedents’ estates which prevails in many states. See, section 62, Model Probate Code. If supervised administration is not requested, persons interested in an estate may use combinations of the formal proceedings (order by judge after notice to persons concerned with the relief sought), informal proceedings (request for the limited response that nonjudicial personnel of the probate court are authorized to make in response to verified application), and filings provided in the remaining Parts of Article III to secure authority and protection needed to administer the estate. Nothing except self-interest will compel resort to the judge. When resort to the judge is necessary or desirable to resolve a dispute or to gain protection, the scope of the proceeding if not otherwise prescribed by the Code is framed by the petition. The securing of necessary jurisdiction over interested persons in a formal proceeding is facilitated by sections 30.1-12-06 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-02" target="_self">30.1-17-02</a></cite>. Section 30.1-13-01 locates venue for all proceedings at the place where the first proceeding occurred.

        Orders in an unsupervised probate are appealable without certification, unless they determine some, but not all, of one creditor’s claims against an estate. Zimbelman v. Loh (In re Estate of Zimbleman), 539 N.W.2d 67, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 193</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order approving personal representative’s calculation of spouse’s elective share and denial of spouse’s motion to amend order were appealable, where estate was under informal probate administration, and each proceeding before the court in the unsupervised administration was independent of any other proceeding involving the same estate. Luken v. Schulz (In re Estate of Luken), 551 N.W.2d 794, 1996 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 197</cite> (N.D. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether widow waived her right to claim an elective share was so interconnected with the unresolved issue of what she would receive under the will, order denying her motion for an elective share was not appealable. Zimmerman v. Zimmerman (In re Estate of Zimmerman), 1997 ND 58, 561 N.W.2d 642, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 55</cite> (N.D. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Son’s appeal of an order denying a widow’s petition to determine an intestate’s heirs was not authorized because the order was not final and further proceedings regarding intestate succession and the determination of heirs could be necessary. Estate of Huston v. Huston, 2014 ND 29, 843 N.W.2d 3, 2014 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 21</cite> (N.D. 2014).

        A workable reconciliation of this rule and the “separate proceeding” provisions of an unsupervised administration is to treat a determination of all of one creditor’s claims against an estate as a separate proceeding which does not need a N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b) certification. However, if one creditor has more than one claim, an appeal from an order resolving some, but not all, of that creditor’s claims is premature without a N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b) certification. In re Estate of Starcher, 447 N.W.2d 293, 1989 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 200</cite> (N.D. 1989).

      No informal probate or appointment proceeding or formal testacy or appointment proceeding, other than a proceeding to probate a will previously probated at the testator’s domicile and appointment proceedings relating to an estate in which there has been a prior appointment, may be commenced more than three years after the decedent’s death, except:

       A proceeding to contest an informally probated will and to secure appointment of the person with legal priority for appointment in the event the contest is successful may be commenced within the later of twelve months from the informal probate or three years from the decedent’s death.

       An informal appointment or a formal testacy or appointment proceeding may be commenced thereafter if no proceeding concerning the succession or estate administration has occurred within the three-year period after the decedent’s death, but the personal representative has no right to possess estate assets as provided in section 30.1-18-09 beyond that necessary to confirm title to the assets in the successors to the estate and claims other than expenses of administration may not be presented against the estate.

       A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced at any time after three years from the decedent’s death for the purpose of establishing an instrument to direct or control the ownership of property passing or distributable after the decedent’s death from one other than the decedent when the property is to be appointed by the terms of the decedent’s will or is to pass or be distributed as a part of the decedent’s estate or its transfer is otherwise to be controlled by the terms of the decedent’s will.

       As originally approved and read with 3-102’s [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-12-02] requirement that wills be probated before being admissible in evidence, this section created a three-year-from-death time period within which proceedings concerning a succession (other than a determination of heirs, or will interpretation or construction) must be commenced. Unless certain limited exceptions were met, an estate became conclusively intestate if no formal or informal estate proceeding was commenced within the three year period, and no administration could be opened in order to generate a deed of distribution for purposes of proving a succession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of the original UPC states rejected the three-year bar against late-offered wills and the correlated notion that formal proceedings to determine heirs in previously unadministered estates were necessary to generate title muniments locating inherited land in lawful successors. Critics preferred continued availability of UPC’s procedures for appointing p.r.’s whose distributive instruments gave protection to purchasers. The 1987 technical amendment to 3-108 [this section] reduced, but failed to eliminate, instances in which original probate and appointment proceedings were barred by the 3 year limitation period.

        Although the district court had diversity jurisdiction over a suit brought by three former designated beneficiaries of accounts owned by a deceased great aunt, the probate exception applied to bar the court from exercising jurisdiction over the beneficiaries’ suit because the probate of the great aunt’s will was closely intertwined with the beneficiaries’ allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the representative and sole beneficiary of the great aunt’s estate and the beneficiaries’ claims for relief included imposing a constructive trust on assets in the estate of the great aunt’s husband. The beneficiaries had time to file a suit pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 30.1-12-08(3) to contest the informal probate of the great aunt’s will, and the state court was the proper forum to invalidate the wills of the great aunt and/or her husband.

       Sections 30.1-02-03 and 30.1-13-01 cover the subject of venue for estate proceedings. Sections 30.1-13-02, 30.1-14-01, 30.1-14-03, and 30.1-14-09 also may be relevant.

        A formal probate or appointment proceeding is initiated in A County. Interested persons who believe that venue is in B County rather than A County must raise their question about venue in A County, because section 30.1-02-03 gives the court in which the proceeding is first commenced authority to resolve disputes over venue. If the court in A County erroneously determines that it has venue, the remedy is by appeal.
       </li>
       <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-13s30.1-13-01-Sourceol12">
        An informal probate or appointment application is filed and granted without notice in A County. If interested persons wish to challenge the registrar’s determination of venue, they may not simply file a formal proceeding in the county of their choice and thus force the proponent in the prior proceeding to debate the question of venue in their county, subsection 2 of section 30.1-13-01 locates the venue of any subsequent proceeding where the first proceeding occurred. The function of subsection 2 is obvious when one thinks of subsequent proceedings as those which relate to claims, or accounts, or to efforts to control a personal representative. It is less obvious when it seems to locate the forum for squabbles over venue at the place accepting the first informal application. Still, the applicant seeking an informal order must be careful about the statements he makes in his application because he may be charged with perjury under section 30.1-02-07 if he is deliberately inaccurate. Moreover, the registrar must be satisfied that the allegations in the application support a finding of venue. Subsection 3 of section 30.1-13-01 provides a remedy for one who is upset about the venue-locating impact of a prior order in an informal proceeding and who does not wish to engage in full litigation about venue in the forum chosen by the other interested person unless he is forced to do so. Using it, he may succeed in getting the A County court to transfer the proceedings to the county of his choice. He would be well advised to initiate formal proceedings if he gets the chance, for if he relies on informal proceedings, he, too, may be “bumped” if the judge in B County agrees with some movant that venue was not in B County.
       </li>
       <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-13s30.1-13-01-Sourceol13">
        If the decedent’s domicile was not in the state, venue is proper under sections 30.1-13-01 and 30.1-02-03 in any county where he had assets.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       One contemplating starting administration because of the presence of local assets should have several other sections of the Code in mind. First, by use of the recognition provisions in Article IV, it may be possible to avoid administration in any state other than that in which the decedent was domiciled. Second, section 30.1-13-03 may apply to give priority for local appointment to the representative appointed at domicile. Third, under section 30.1-14-09, informal appointment proceedings in this state will be dismissed if it is known that a personal representative has been previously appointed at domicile.

    Appointment or testacy proceedings — Conflicting claim of domicile in another state.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If conflicting claims as to the domicile of a decedent are made in a formal testacy or appointment proceeding commenced in this state, and in a testacy or appointment proceeding after notice pending at the same time in another state, the court of this state must stay, dismiss, or permit suitable amendment in the proceeding here unless it is determined that the local proceeding was commenced before the proceeding elsewhere. The determination of domicile in the proceeding first commenced must be accepted as determinative in the proceeding in this state.

      <p>
       This section is designed to reduce the possibility that conflicting findings of domicile in two or more states may result in inconsistent administration and distribution of parts of the same estate. Section 30.1-15-08 dealing with the effect of adjudications in other states concerning testacy supports the same general purpose to use domiciliary law to unify succession of property located in different states.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether testate or intestate, succession should follow the presumed wishes of the decedent whenever possible. Unless a decedent leaves a separate will for the portion of his estate located in each different state, it is highly unlikely that he would want different portions of his estate subject to different rules simply because courts reach conflicting conclusions concerning his domicile. It is pointless to debate whether he would prefer one or the other of the conflicting rules, when the paramount inference is that the decedent would prefer that his estate be unified under either rule rather than wasted in litigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The section adds very little to existing law. If a previous estate proceeding in State A has determined that the decedent was a domiciliary of A, persons who were personally before the court in A would be precluded by the principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel (and full faith and credit) from relitigating the issue of domicile in a later proceeding in State B. Probably, it would not matter in this setting that domicile was a jurisdictional fact. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 59 S. Ct. 134, 305 U.S. 165, 83 L. Ed. 104 (1938). Even if the parties to a present proceeding were not personally before the court in an earlier proceeding in State A involving the same decedent, the prior judgment would be binding as to property subject to the power of the courts in A, on persons to whom due notice of the proceeding was given. Riley v. New York Trust Co., 62 S. Ct. 608, 315 U.S. 343, 86 L. Ed. 885 (1942); Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank and Trust Co., 70 S. Ct. 652, 339 U.S. 306, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a court learns that parties before it are also parties to previously initiated litigation involving a common question, traditional judicial reluctance to deciding unnecessary questions, as well as considerations of comity, are likely to lead it to delay the local proceedings to await the result in the other court. A somewhat more troublesome question is involved when one of the parties before the local court manifests a determination not to appear personally in the prior initiated proceedings so that he can preserve his ability to litigate contested points in a more friendly, or convenient, forum. But, the need to preserve all possible advantages available to particular litigants should be subordinated to the decedent’s probable wish that his estate not be wasted in unnecessary litigation. Thus, the section requires that the local claimant either initiate litigation in the forum of his choice before litigation is started somewhere else, or accept the necessity of contesting unwanted views concerning the decedent’s domicile offered in litigation pending elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is to be noted, in this connection, that the local suitor always will have a chance to contest the question of domicile in the other state. His locally initiated proceedings may proceed to a valid judgment accepting his theory of the case unless parties who would oppose him appear and defend on the theory that the domicile question is currently being litigated elsewhere. If the litigation in the other state has proceeded to judgment, section 30.1-15-08 rather than the instant section will govern. If this section applies, it will mean that the foreign proceedings are still pending, so that the local person’s contention concerning domicile can be made therein even though until the defense of litigation elsewhere is offered in the local proceedings, he may not have been notified of the foreign proceeding.

       The priorities applicable to informal proceedings are applicable to formal proceedings. However, if the proceedings are formal, a person with a substantial interest may object to the selection of one having priority other than because of will provisions. The provision for majority approval which is triggered by such a protest can be handled in a formal proceeding since all interested persons will be before the court, and a judge capable of handling discretionary matters, will be involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       In considering this section as it relates to a devise to a trustee for various beneficiaries, it is to be noted that “interested persons” is defined by subsection 21 of section 30.1-01-06 to include fiduciaries. Also, subsection 2 of section 30.1-03-03 and section 30.1-20-12 show a purpose to make trustees serve as representatives of all beneficiaries. The provision in subsection 4 of this section is consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a state’s statutes recognize a public administrator or public trustee as the appropriate agency to seek administration of estates in which the state may have an interest, it would be appropriate to indicate in this section the circumstances under which such an officer may seek administration. If no officer is recognized locally, the state could claim as heir by virtue of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIc30.1-04s30.1-04-05" target="_self">30.1-04-05</a></cite>.

       Subsection 7 of this section was inserted in connection with the decision to abandon the effort to describe ancillary administration in Article IV. Other provisions in Article III which are relevant to administration of assets in a state other than that of the decedent’s domicile are section 30.1-02-01 (territorial effect), section 30.1-13-01 (venue), section 30.1-14-07 (informal appointment for nonresident decedent delayed thirty days), section 30.1-14-08 (no informal appointment here if a representative has been appointed at domicile), section 30.1-19-15 (duty of personal representative where administration is more than one state), and sections 30.1-24-02 through 30.1-24-06 (local recognition of foreign personal representatives).

        As a general rule and in accordance with the statutory provisions, a domiciled heir, a member of the family in its enlarged sense, if available, is and should be given priority for appointment as personal representative or administrator; however, this is not an inflexible position and extenuating circumstances may, and at certain times must, be considered.

        Where conservator of estate of one sister of the intestate decedents and another sister of the intestate decedents both petitioned to have themselves appointed as administrator and personal representative over the estates, and none of the other heirs appeared or expressed any objection or preference between the conservator and the sister, the court acted properly under this section in appointing the conservator, who was the county public administrator, as administrator and personal representative of the estates where more than three years had passed since the death of one decedent without any heir taking action; sister filed her petition only after conservator first filed; sister’s residence in California would involve unneeded duplicity and difficulty; and it was determined to be in the best interests of all three estates to have one person handle them all.

      <p>
       Forcing one who seeks informal probate or informal appointment to make oath before a public official concerning the details required of applications should deter persons who might otherwise misuse the no-notice feature of informal proceedings. The application is available as a part of the public record. If deliberately false representation is made, remedies for fraud will be available to injured persons without specified time limit (see Article I). The section is believed to provide important safeguards that may extend well beyond those presently available under supervised administration for persons damaged by deliberate wrongdoing.

       Section 30.1-02-07 deals with verification.

       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended the addition of subsection (b) [subsection (2)] to reflect an improvement accomplished in the first enactment in Idaho. The addition, which is a form of long-arm provision that affects everyone who acts as an applicant in informal proceedings, in conjunction with Section 1-106 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-03] provides a remedy in the Court against anyone who might make known misstatements in an application. The addition is not needed in the case of an applicant who becomes a personal representative as a result of his application for the implied consent provided in Section 3-602 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-17-02] would cover the matter. Also, the requirement that the applicant state that time limits on informal probate and appointment have not run, formerly appearing as (iv) under paragraph (2) was expanded to refer to informal appointment and moved into (1). Correcting an oversight in the original text, this change coordinates the statements required in an application with the limitations provisions of Section 3-108 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-12-08].

     <p>
      Upon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will, the court, upon making the findings required by section 30.1-14-03, shall issue a written statement of informal probate if at least one hundred twenty hours have elapsed since the decedent’s death. Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding. No defect in the application or procedure relating thereto which leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void.

      <p>
       Model Probate Code sections 68 and 70 contemplate probate by judicial order as the only method of validating a will. This “umbrella” section and the sections it refers to describe an alternative procedure called “informal probate”. A succeeding section describes cases in which informal probate is to be denied. “Informal probate” is subjected to safeguards which seem appropriate to a transaction which has the effect of making a will operative and which may be the only official reaction concerning its validity. “Informal probate”, it is hoped, will serve to keep the simple will which generates no controversy from becoming involved in truly judicial proceedings. The procedure is very much like “probate in common form” as it is known in England and some states.

       The purpose of this section is to permit informal probate of a will which, from a simple attestation clause, appears to have been executed properly. It is not necessary that the will be notarized as is the case with “pre-proved” wills in some states. If a will is “pre-proved” as provided in Article II, it will, of course, “appear” to be well executed and include the recital necessary for easy probate here. If the instrument does not contain a proper recital by attesting witnesses, it may be probated informally on the strength of an affidavit by a person who can say what occurred at the time of execution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except where probate or its equivalent has occurred previously in another state, informal probate is available only where an original will exists and is available to be filed. Lost or destroyed wills must be established in formal proceedings. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-02" target="_self">30.1-15-02</a></cite>. Under Section 3-401 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-15-01], pendency of formal testacy proceedings blocks informal probate or appointment proceedings.

      <p>
       District court erred in finding that the testator’s missing will was not presumed to be revoked, because while N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-07 did not speak to admitting a lost will and neither N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-14-03 nor 30.1-15-02 provided specific presumptions for admitting a missing will, the drafter’s of the Uniform Probate Code did contemplate the probate of lost wills, and the district court erroneously failed to apply the common law amino revocandi presumption that a missing will was revoked; if a will could not be found upon the death of the testator, the presumption arose that the testator revoked the missing will, and under N.D.R.Ev. 301(a), the party seeking to probate the missing will must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the testator did not destroy or revoke the missing will animo revocandi.

       The purpose of this section is to recognize that the court should have some authority to deny probate to an instrument even though all stated statutory requirements may be said to have been met. Denial of an application for informal probate cannot be appealed. Rather, the proponent may initiate a formal proceeding so that the matter may be brought before the judge in the normal way for contested matters.

       This provision assumes that there will be a single office within each county or other area of jurisdiction of the probate court which can be checked for demands for notice relating to estates in that area. If there are or may be several offices within a given area, provision would need to be made so that information concerning demands for notice might be obtained from the main office.

       Sections 30.1-17-14 and 30.1-17-15 make it clear that a special administrator may be appointed to conserve the estate during any period of delay in probate of a will. Even though the will has not been approved, section 30.1-17-14 gives priority for appointment as special administrator to the person nominated by the will which has been offered for probate. Section 30.1-05-03 governs priorities for appointment. Under it, one or more of the same class may receive priority through agreement of the others.

       The last sentence of the section is designed to prevent informal appointment of a personal representative in this state when a personal representative has been previously appointed at the decedent’s domicile.

       A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will. A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing a petition as described in subsection 1 of section 30.1-15-02 in which the interested person requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will which is the subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with subsection 2 of section 30.1-15-02 for an order that the decedent died intestate.

A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the powers of that office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator. In the absence of a request, or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “testacy” is used to refer to the general status of a decedent in regard to wills. Thus, it embraces the possibility that he left no will, any question of which of several instruments is his valid will, and the possibility that he died intestate as to a part of his estate, and testate as to the balance. See section 30.1-01-06, subsection 44.
      </p>
      <p>
       The formal proceedings described by this section may be: 1. an original proceeding to secure “solemn form” probate of a will; 2. a proceeding to secure “solemn form” probate to corroborate a previous informal probate; 3. a proceeding to block a pending application for informal probate, or to prevent an informal application from occurring thereafter; 4. a proceeding to contradict a previous order of informal probate; 5. a proceeding to secure a declaratory judgment of intestacy and a determination of heirs in a case where no will has been offered. If a pending informal application for probate is blocked by a formal proceeding, the applicant may withdraw his application and avoid the obligation of going forward with prima facie proof of due execution. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-07" target="_self">30.1-15-07</a></cite>. The petitioner in the formal proceedings may be content to let matters stop there, or he can frame his petition, or amend, so that he may secure an adjudication of intestacy which would prevent further activity concerning the will.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a personal representative has been appointed prior to the commencement of a formal testacy proceeding, the petitioner must request confirmation of the appointment to indicate that he does not want the testacy proceeding to have any effect on the duties of the personal representative, or refrain from seeking confirmation, in which case, the proceeding suspends the distributive power of the previously appointed representative. If nothing else is requested or decided in respect to the personal representative, his distributive powers are restored at the completion of the proceeding, with section 30.1-18-03 directing him to abide by the will. “Distribute” and “distribution” do not include payment of claims. See subsection 11 of section 30.1-01-06, and sections 30.1-19-07 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-20s30.1-20-02" target="_self">30.1-20-02</a></cite>.

      </p>
      <p>
       If a petitioner seeks an adjudication that a decedent died intestate, he is required also to obtain a finding of heirship. A formal proceeding which is to be effective on all interested persons must follow reasonable notice to such persons. It seems desirable to force the proceedings through a formal determination of heirship because the finding will bolster the order, as well as preclude later questions that might arise at the time of distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless an order of supervised administration is sought, there will be little occasion for a formal order concerning appointment of a personal representative which does not also adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent. If a formal order of appointment is sought because of disagreement over who should serve, section 30.1-15-14 describes the appropriate procedure.
      </p>

       The words “otherwise unavailable” in subsection 1 are not intended to be read restrictively.

        Lost Or Destroyed Will.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       District court erred in finding that the testator’s missing will was not presumed to be revoked, because while N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-07 did not speak to admitting a lost will and neither N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-14-03 nor 30.1-15-02 provided specific presumptions for admitting a missing will, the drafter’s of the Uniform Probate Code did contemplate the probate of lost wills, and the district court erroneously failed to apply the common law amino revocandi presumption that a missing will was revoked; if a will could not be found upon the death of the testator, the presumption arose that the testator revoked the missing will, and under N.D.R.Ev. 301(a), the party seeking to probate the missing will must demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the testator did not destroy or revoke the missing will animo revocandi.

       Provisions governing the time and manner of notice required by this section and other sections in the Code are contained in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-01" target="_self">30.1-03-01</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions concerning search for the alleged decedent are derived from Model Probate Code, section 71.
      </p>
      <p>
       Testacy proceedings involve adjudications that no will exists. Unknown wills as well as any which are brought to the attention of the court are affected. Persons with potential interests under unknown wills have the notice afforded by death and by publication. Notice requirements extend also to persons named in a will that is known to the petitioners to exist, irrespective of whether it has been probated or offered for formal or informal probate, if their position may be affected adversely by granting of the petition. But, a rigid statutory requirement relating to such persons might cause undue difficulty. Hence, the statute merely provides that the petitioner may notify other persons.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would not be inconsistent with this section for the court to adopt rules designed to make petitioners exercise reasonable diligence in searching for as yet undiscovered wills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 30.1-12-06 provides that an order is valid as to those given notice, though less than all interested persons were given notice. Subsection 2 of section 30.1-21-01 provides a means of extending a testacy order to previously unnotified persons in connection with a formal closing.

     <p>
      Any party to a formal proceeding who opposes the probate of a will for any reason shall state in that party’s pleadings the objections to probate of the will. In a contested formal testacy proceeding, any party is entitled to a jury trial of all issues of fact by serving upon all appropriate parties and filing with the court a written demand for jury trial. The written demand must be affixed to the pleading of the party which raises any issues of fact and may not be served and filed later than seven days before the time set for hearing.

      <p>
       Model Probate Code section 72 requires a contestant to file written objections to any will he would oppose. The provision prevents potential confusion as to who must file what pleading that can arise from the notion that the probate of a will is in rem. The petition for probate of a revoking will is sufficient warning to proponents of the revoked will.

      If a petition in a testacy proceeding is unopposed, the court may order probate or intestacy on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of section 30.1-15-09 have been met, or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters necessary to support the order sought. If evidence concerning execution of the will is necessary, the affidavit or testimony of one of any attesting witnesses to the instrument is sufficient.

      </p>
      <p>
       For various reasons, attorneys handling estates may want interested persons to be gathered for a hearing before the court on the formal allowance of the will. The court is not required to conduct a hearing, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       If no hearing is required, uncontested formal probates can be completed on the strength of the pleadings. There is no good reason for summoning attestors when no interested person wants to force the production of evidence on a formal probate. Moreover, there seems to be no valid distinction between litigation to establish a will, and other civil litigation, in respect to whether the court may enter judgment on the pleadings.

    Formal testacy proceedings — Burdens in contested cases.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue, and heirship. Proponents of a will have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases, and, if they are also petitioners, prima facie proof of death and venue. Contestants of a will have the burden of establishing lack of testamentary intent or capacity, undue influence, fraud, duress, mistake, revocation, or other cause affecting its validity. Parties have the ultimate burden of persuasion as to matters with respect to which they have the initial burden of proof. If a will is opposed by the petition for probate of a later will revoking the former, it shall be determined first whether the later will is entitled to probate, and if a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, it shall be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.

        North Dakota law provides that contestants of a will have the burden of establishing lack of intent or capacity as well as undue influence. Will contestants must prove undue influence at the time of the execution of the will. Rogers v. Mickelson, 477 N.W.2d 247 (N.D. 1991).

       <p>
        Where it was clear that testator intended to draft the instrument and that he intended to sign it, it was irrelevant whether he harbored some secret intention that his actions would have no effect on the disposition of his estate; the consequence of drafting and executing an unambiguous will is that it will have legal effect upon the testator’s death. Norback v. Duemeland (In re Estate of Duemeland), 528 N.W.2d 369, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1995).

        Although this section generally recognizes mistake, along with several other grounds, as a basis for contesting the validity of a will, N.D.C.C. § 30.1-06-02 specifically controls whether the omission of a child from a will was because of mistake or was intentional. Cates v. Pfeifer, 460 N.W.2d 699 (N.D. 1990).

        Since the trial court instructed that plaintiff, as the person contesting the will, had the burden of proof, there was no error in declining to further instruct that one who makes a will is presumed sane as this presumption was already a function of the burden of proof on the contestant as the trial court instructed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Generally, when a will is shown to have been validly executed, the burden of proving revocation rests on one claiming revocation. In re Estate of Papineau, 396 N.W.2d 735, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 442</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in determining appellant will proponent presented evidence strong enough to establish met his burden under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-15-07 of proving due execution of decedent’s will, because the court relied upon the notes of the deceased attorney who drafted the will, the deposition testimony of the attorney’s secretary, and the testimony of a witness who saw the signed will. Because the will could not be found upon decedent’s death, the district court correctly applied the presumption that the missing will had been revoked.
   In re Estate of Clemetson v. Evanson, 2012 ND 28, 812 N.W.2d 388, 2012 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 25</cite> (N.D. 2012).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Testamentary capacity is presumed and the burden of proving lack of capacity is on contestants, who also have the burden of sustaining a challenge to the validity of a will on the ground of undue influence. In re Estate of Papineau, 396 N.W.2d 735, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 442</cite> (N.D. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, the contestants of a will have the burden of proving lack of testamentary capacity. In re Estate of Aune, 478 N.W.2d 561, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Direct evidence that the decedent fully read and understood all of the provisions of his or her will is unnecessary. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not essential that a testator understand the meaning of the technical clauses of a will, if the instrument is intended as a will and if it expresses the testator’s intent to distribute his property at death. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of whether a testator was suffering from an insane delusion which materially affected the will is a question of fact. The contestants must establish that the will was a product of the insane delusion and that the testator, if not laboring under the insane delusion, would have differently devised the property. In re Estate of Aune, 478 N.W.2d 561, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 227</cite> (N.D. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because appellant, who claimed that her father's will was the product of an insane delusion, did not make an appropriate offer of proof to properly preserve issues about evidence she claimed was improperly excluded, the district court did not improperly preclude appellant from presenting evidence about her father's alleged mental illness. Bell State Bank &amp; Trust v. Oakland (In re Gassmann), 2015 ND 188, 867 N.W.2d 325, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 203</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        If a duly executed will contains the decedent’s general instructions for its contents, testamentary intent exists. In re Estate of Ostby, 479 N.W.2d 866, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 32</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding testamentary intent, in the absence of ambiguity, extrinsic evidence is not admissible except to show fraud or mistake. Norback v. Duemeland (In re Estate of Duemeland), 528 N.W.2d 369, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 36</cite> (N.D. 1995).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no presumption of undue influence where the proponent of the will, while occupying a confidential relationship with the testator, participated in the preparation or procurement of the will and received a substantial bequest or benefit thereunder. In re Estate of Wagner, 265 N.W.2d 459, 1978 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 229</cite> (N.D. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant to the will carried the burden of proving that the will was the result of undue influence. In re Estate of Stenerson, 348 N.W.2d 141, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Elements necessary to invalidate a will on the ground of undue influence are: that the testator was subject to such influence; that the opportunity to exercise it existed; that there was a disposition to exercise it; and that the result appears to be the effect of such influence. In re Estate of Stenerson, 348 N.W.2d 141, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of whether or not a testator was unduly influenced is a question of fact, and that determination, when made by the district court as finder of fact, will not be set aside on appeal unless clearly erroneous. In re Estate of Stenerson, 348 N.W.2d 141, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        To be undue, the influence must dominate and control the making of the will such as to make the will express the purpose and intent of the person exercising the influence rather than the testator’s purpose and intent. In re Estate of Stenerson, 348 N.W.2d 141, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 303</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Elements necessary to invalidate a will on the basis of undue influence are that the testator was subject to such influence, the opportunity to exercise it existed, there was a disposition to exercise it, and that the result appears to be the effect of such influence; to be undue, the influence must operate at the time the will is made and must dominate and control the making of the will so as to make the will express the purpose and intent of the person exercising the influence and not the purpose and intent of the testator. Okken v. Okken Estate, 348 N.W.2d 447, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 297</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence which raises a mere suspicion of undue influence is insufficient to support a finding of undue influence. In re Estate of Polda, 349 N.W.2d 11, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no presumption of undue influence, and the burden of proof does not shift to the proponent of the will to show lack of undue influence, where a confidential relationship exists between the proponent and the testator, coupled with the proponent participating in the preparation of the will and receiving a benefit by its terms. In re Estate of Polda, 349 N.W.2d 11, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 287</cite> (N.D. 1984).

     <p>
      A final order of a court of another state determining testacy, the validity or construction of a will, made in a proceeding involving notice to and an opportunity for contest by all interested persons must be accepted as determinative by the courts of this state if it includes, or is based upon, a finding that the decedent was domiciled at the time of death in the state where the order was made.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section is designed to extend the effect of final orders of another jurisdiction of the United States. It should not be read to restrict the obligation of the local court to respect the judgment of another court when parties who were personally before the other court also are personally before the local court. An “authenticated copy” includes copies properly certified under the full faith and credit statute. If conflicting claims of domicile are made in proceedings which are commenced in different jurisdictions, section 30.1-13-02 applies. This section is framed to apply where a formal proceeding elsewhere has been previously concluded. Hence, if a local proceeding is concluded before formal proceedings at domicile are concluded, local law will control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Informal proceedings by which a will is probated or a personal representative is appointed are not proceedings which must be respected by a local court under either section 30.1-13-02 or this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this section bears on questions of what assets are included in a decedent’s estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section adds nothing to existing law as applied to cases where the parties before the local court were also personally before the foreign court, or where the property involved was subject to the power of the foreign court. It extends present law so that, for some purposes, the law of another state may become binding in regard to due execution or revocation of wills controlling local land, and to questions concerning the meaning of ambiguous words in wills involving local land. But, choice of law rules frequently produce a similar result. See § 240 Restatement of the Law, Second: Conflict of Laws, p. 73, Proposed Official Draft III, 1969.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section may be easier to justify than familiar choice of law rules, for its application is limited to instances where the protesting party has had notice of, and an opportunity to participate in, previous litigation resolving the question he now seeks to raise.

     <p>
      If two or more instruments are offered for probate before a final order is entered in a formal testacy proceeding, more than one instrument may be probated if neither expressly revokes the other or contains provisions which work a total revocation by implication. If more than one instrument is probated, the order shall indicate what provisions control in respect to the nomination of an executor, if any. The order may, but need not, indicate how any provisions of a particular instrument are affected by the other instrument.

       Except as otherwise provided in section 30.1-15-12, an order in a formal testacy proceeding serves to end the time within which it is possible to probate after-discovered wills, or to give effect to late-discovered facts concerning heirship. Determination of heirs is not barred by the three-year limitation but a judicial determination of heirs is conclusive unless the order may be vacated.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section authorizes a court to engage in some construction of wills incident to determining whether a will is entitled to probate. It seems desirable to leave the extent of this power to the sound discretion of the court. If wills are not construed in connection with a judicial probate, they may be subject to construction at any time.

       The provisions barring proof of late-discovered wills are derived in part from section 81 of Model Probate Code. The same section is the source of the provisions of subsection 5 above. The provisions permitting vacation of an order determining heirs on certain conditions reflect the effort to offer parallel possibilities for adjudications in testate and intestate estates. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-01" target="_self">30.1-15-01</a></cite>. An objective is to make it possible to handle an intestate estate exactly as a testate estate may be handled. If this is achieved, some of the pressure on persons to make wills may be relieved.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an alleged decedent turns out to have been alive, heirs and distributees are liable to restore the “estate or its proceeds”. If neither can be identified through the normal process of tracing assets, their liability depends upon the circumstances. The liability of distributees to claimants whose claims have not been barred, or to persons shown to be entitled to distribution when a formal proceeding changes a previous assumption informally established which guided an earlier distribution, is different. See sections 30.1-20-09 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-04" target="_self">30.1-21-04</a></cite>.

        When the formal processes of admitting a will to probate, appointing a personal representative, or settling an estate are preceded by notice to all interested persons and a full adversarial hearing, the adjudication generally binds notified persons. An independent action for relief from fraud is authorized, if it has not already been litigated in a formal testacy proceeding, and a party wronged by fraud may bring a timely action outside of the usual procedures and limitations.

        In a statutory proceeding to contest a will after probate, the court would not consider a challenge on the ground that a jurisdictional fact was wanting in probate where the petitioners submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and asked for a determination as to the validity of the will. In re McKee's Estate, 67 N.D. 504, 274 N.W. 601, 1937 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 106</cite> (N.D. 1937).

        Where final decree in probate sale was entered on November 21, 1941, and petition to set aside sale and have estate reopened was filed in 1948, the only matter that the petitioner could have considered on appeal was whether any fact in the proceedings of the county court necessary to jurisdiction was nonexistent.

       A petition raising a controversy concerning the priority or qualifications of a personal representative may be combined with a petition in a formal testacy proceeding. However, it is not necessary to petition formally for the appointment of a personal representative as a part of a formal testacy proceeding. A personal representative may be appointed on informal application either before or after formal proceedings which establish whether the decedent died testate or intestate or no appointment may be desired. See sections 30.1-12-07, 30.1-14-01 (subsections 3 and 4), and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-14s30.1-14-07" target="_self">30.1-14-07</a></cite>. Furthermore, procedures for securing the appointment of a new personal representative after a previous assumption as to testacy has been changed are provided by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-12" target="_self">30.1-17-12</a></cite>. These may be informal, or related to pending formal proceedings concerning testacy. A formal order relating to appointment may be desired when there is a dispute concerning priority or qualification to serve but no dispute concerning testacy. It is important to distinguish formal proceedings concerning appointment from “supervised administration”. The former includes any proceeding after notice involving a request for an appointment. The latter originates in a “formal proceeding” and may be requested in addition to a ruling concerning testacy or priority or qualifications of a personal representative, but is descriptive of a special proceeding with a different scope and purpose than those concerned merely with establishing the bases for an administration. In other words, a personal representative appointed in a “formal” proceeding may or may not be “supervised”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point should be noted. The Court may not immediately issue letters even though a formal proceeding seeking appointment is involved and results in an order authorizing appointment. Rather, chapter 30.1-17 controls the subject of qualification. Section 30.1-02-05 deals with letters.

     <p>
      Supervised administration is a single in rem proceeding to secure complete administration and settlement of a decedent’s estate under the continuing authority of the court which extends until entry of an order approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative, or other order terminating the proceeding. A supervised personal representative is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested parties, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a supervised personal representative has the same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not supervised.

      <p>
       This and the following sections of this chapter describe an optional procedure for settling an estate in one continuous proceeding in the court. The proceeding is characterized as “in rem” to align it with the concepts described by the Model Probate Code. See section 62, M.P.C. In cases where supervised administration is not requested or ordered, no compulsion other than self-interest exists to compel use of a formal testacy proceeding to secure an adjudication of a will or no will, because informal probate or appointment of an administrator in intestacy may be used. Similarly, unless administration is supervised, there is no compulsion other than self-interest to use a formal closing proceeding. Thus, even though an estate administration may be begun by use of a formal testacy proceeding which may involve an order concerning who is to be appointed personal representative, the proceeding is over when the order concerning testacy and appointment is entered. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-12s30.1-12-07" target="_self">30.1-12-07</a></cite>. Supervised administration, therefore, is appropriate when an interested person desires assurance that the essential steps regarding opening and closing of an estate will be adjudicated. See the Comment following the next section.

       Appellate court could hear a son's appeal of a will's interpretation because (1) orders entered in the supervised probate proceeding were not final until a final distribution was approved, and (2) the son's notice of appeal was timely filed after the final order of distribution was entered. Grengs v. Lakefield (Estate of Grengs), 2015 ND 152, 864 N.W.2d 424, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 158</cite> (N.D. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       A workable reconciliation of this rule and the “separate proceeding” provisions of an unsupervised administration is to treat a determination of all of one creditor’s claims against an estate as a separate proceeding which does not need a Rule 54(b) certification. However, if one creditor has more than one claim, an appeal from an order resolving some, but not all, of that creditor’s claims is premature without a Rule 54(b) certification.

      <p>
       The expressed wishes of a testator regarding supervised administration should bear upon, but not control, the question of whether supervised administration will be ordered. This section is designed to achieve a fair balance between the wishes of the decedent, and the interests of successors in regard to supervised administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since supervised administration normally will result in an adjudicated distribution of the estate, the issue of will or no will must be adjudicated. This section achieves this by forcing a petition for supervised administration to include matters necessary to put the issue of testacy before the court. It is possible, however, that supervised administration will be requested because administrative complexities warranting it develop after the issue of will or no will has been resolved in a previously concluded formal testacy proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that supervised administration, though it compels a judicial settlement of an estate, is not the only route to obtaining judicial review and settlement at the close of an administration. The procedures described in sections 30.1-22-01 and 30.1-22-02 are available for use by or against personal representatives who are not supervised. Also efficient remedies for breach of duty by a personal representative who is not supervised are available under chapter 30.1-17 of this Article. Finally, each personal representative consents to jurisdiction of the court as invoked by mailed notice of any proceeding relating to the estate which may be initiated by an interested person. Also, persons interested in the estate may be subjected to orders of the court following mailed notices made in proceedings initiated by the personal representative. In combination, these possibilities mean that supervised administration will be valuable principally to persons who see some advantage in a single judicial proceeding which will produce adjudications on all major points involved in an estate settlement.

       The duties and powers of a personal representative are described in chapter 30.1-18 of this Article. The ability of a personal representative to create a good title in a purchaser of estate assets is not hampered by the fact that the personal representative may breach a duty created by statute, court order, or other circumstances in making the sale. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-18s30.1-18-15" target="_self">30.1-18-15</a></cite>. However, formal proceedings against a personal representative may involve requests for qualification of the power normally possessed by personal representatives which, if granted, would subject the personal representative to the penalties for contempt of court if he disregarded the restriction. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-07" target="_self">30.1-17-07</a></cite>. If a proceeding also involved a demand that particular real estate be kept in the estate pending determination of a petitioner’s claim thereto, notice of the pendency of the proceeding could be recorded as is usual under the jurisdiction’s system for the lis pendens concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word “restricts” in the last sentence is intended to negate the idea that a judicial order specially qualifying the powers and duties of a personal representative is a restraining order in the usual sense. The section means simply that some supervised personal representatives may receive the same powers and duties as ordinary personal representatives, except that they must obtain a court order before paying claimants or distributing, while others may receive a more restricted set of powers. Section 30.1-17-07 governs petitions which seek to limit the power of a personal representative.

      Unless restricted by the court, a supervised personal representative has, without interim orders approving exercise of a power, all powers of personal representatives under this title, but shall not exercise the power to make any distribution of the estate without prior order of the court. Any other restriction on the power of a personal representative which may be ordered by the court must be endorsed on the personal representative’s letters of appointment and, unless so endorsed, is ineffective as to persons dealing in good faith with the personal representative.

       This section provides authority to issue letters showing restrictions of power of supervised administrators. In general, persons dealing with personal representatives are not bound to inquire concerning the authority of a personal representative, and are not affected by provisions in a will or judicial order unless they know of it. But, it is expected that persons dealing with personal representatives will want to see the personal representative’s letters, and this section has the practical effect of requiring them to do so. No provision is made for noting restrictions in letters except in the case of supervised representatives. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-18s30.1-18-15" target="_self">30.1-18-15</a></cite>.

       Since supervised administration is a single proceeding, the notice requirement contained in section 30.1-12-06 relates to the notice of institution of the proceedings which is described with particularity by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-16s30.1-16-02" target="_self">30.1-16-02</a></cite>. The above section makes it clear that an additional notice is required for a closing order. It was discussed whether provision for notice of interim orders should be included. It was decided to leave the point to be covered by court order or rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a suggestion for a rule as follows: “Unless otherwise required by order, notice of interim orders in supervised administration need be given only to interested persons who request notice of all orders entered in the proceeding”. Section 30.1-03-02 permits any person to waive notice by a writing filed in the proceeding.
      </p>
      <p>
       A demand for notice under section 30.1-13-04 would entitle any interested person to notice of any interim order which might be made in the course of supervised administration.

       An interim order in supervised administration, pursuant to a hearing upon notice but where notice of entry is not given, stands unless duly vacated pursuant to the rules of civil procedure. Further, it is subject to appellate review as an interlocutory order, upon appeal from a final order completing settlement of the estate.

       An interim order in supervised administration may be reviewed upon direct appeal when there is an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and an express direction for its entry as a final judgment under N.D.R.Civ.P. 54(b).

       This and related sections of this chapter describe details and conditions of appointment which apply to all personal representatives without regard to whether the appointment proceeding involved is formal or informal, or whether the personal representative is supervised. Section 30.1-02-05 authorizes issuance of copies of letters and prescribes their content. The section should be read with section 30.1-16-04 which directs endorsement on letters of any restrictions of power of a supervised administrator.

       Except for personal representatives appointed pursuant to section 30.1-16-02, appointees are not deemed to be “officers” of the appointing court or to be parties in one continuous judicial proceeding that extends until final settlement. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-12s30.1-12-07" target="_self">30.1-12-07</a></cite>. Yet, it is desirable to continue present patterns which prevent a personal representative who might make himself unavailable to service within the state from affecting the power of the appointing court to enter valid orders affecting him. See Michigan Trust Co. v. Ferry, 33 S. Ct. 550, 228 U.S. 346, 57 L. Ed. 867 (1912). The concept employed to accomplish this is that of requiring each appointee to consent in advance to the personal jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted against him. The section requires that he be given notice of any such proceeding, which, when considered in the light of the responsibility he has undertaken, should make the procedure sufficient to meet the requirements of due process.

Bond required by any will may be dispensed with in formal proceedings upon determination by the court that it is not necessary. No bond is required of any personal representative who, pursuant to statute, has deposited cash or collateral with an agency of this state to secure performance of the personal representative’s duties.

      <p>
       This section must be read with the next three sections. The purpose of these provisions is to move away from the idea that bond always should be required of a probate fiduciary, or required unless a will excuses it. Also, it is designed to keep the court acting pursuant to applications in informal proceedings from passing judgment in each case on the need for bond. The point is that the court is not responsible for seeing that personal representatives perform as they are supposed to perform. Rather, performance is coerced by the remedies available to interested persons. Interested persons are protected by their ability to demand prior notice of informal proceedings (section 30.1-13-04), to contest a requested appointment by use of a formal testacy proceeding or by use of a formal proceeding seeking the appointment of another person. Section 30.1-12-05 gives general authority to the court in a formal proceeding to make appropriate orders as desirable incident to estate administration. This should be sufficient to make it clear that an informal application may be blocked by a formal petition which disputes the matters stated in the petition. Furthermore, an interested person has the remedies provided in sections 30.1-17-05 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-07" target="_self">30.1-17-07</a></cite>. Finally, interested persons have assurance under this Code that their rights in respect to the value of a decedent’s estate cannot be terminated without a judicial order after notice or before the passage of three years from the decedent’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is believed that the total package of protection thus afforded may represent more real protection than a blanket requirement of bond. Surely, it permits a reduction in the procedures which must occur in uncomplicated estates where interested persons are perfectly willing to trust each other and the fiduciary.

      If bond is required and the provisions of the will or order do not specify the amount, unless stated in that person’s application or petition, the person qualifying shall file a statement under oath with the court indicating that person’s best estimate of the value of the personal estate of the decedent and of the income expected from the personal and real estate during the next year, and shall execute and file a bond with the court, or give other suitable security, in an amount not less than the estimate. The court shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or one or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property, or other adequate security. The court may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of assets of the estate deposited with a domestic financial institution, as defined in section 30.1-31-02, in a manner that prevents their unauthorized disposition. On petition of the personal representative or another interested person, the court may excuse a requirement of bond, increase or reduce the amount of the bond, release sureties, or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties.

       This section permits estimates of value needed to fix the amount of required bond to be filed when it becomes necessary. A consequence of this procedure is that estimates of value of estates no longer need appear in the petitions and applications which will attend every administered estate. Hence, a measure of privacy that is not possible under most existing procedures may be achieved. A co-signature arrangement might constitute adequate security within the meaning of this section.

    Demand for bond by interested person.

     <p>
      Any person apparently having an interest in the estate worth in excess of one thousand dollars, or any creditor having a claim in excess of one thousand dollars, may make a written demand that a personal representative give bond. The demand must be filed with the court and a copy mailed to the personal representative if appointment and qualification have occurred. Thereupon, bond is required, but the requirement ceases if the person demanding bond ceases to be interested in the estate, or if bond is excused as provided in section 30.1-17-03 or <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-04" target="_self">30.1-17-04</a></cite>. After receiving notice and until the filing of the bond or cessation of the requirement of bond, the personal representative shall refrain from exercising any powers of office except as necessary to preserve the estate. Failure of the personal representative to meet a requirement of bond by giving suitable bond within thirty days after receipt of notice is cause for removal and appointment of a successor personal representative.

       The demand for bond described in this section may be made in a petition or application for appointment of a personal representative, or may be made after a personal representative has been appointed. The mechanism for compelling bond is designed to function without unnecessary judicial involvement. If demand for bond is made in a formal proceeding, the judge can determine the amount of bond to be required with due consideration for all circumstances. If demand is not made in formal proceedings, methods for computing the amount of bond are provided by statute so that the demand can be complied with without resort to judicial proceedings. The information which a personal representative is required by section 30.1-18-05 to give each beneficiary includes a statement concerning whether bond has been required.

       Cf. section 30.1-15-01 which provides for a restraining order against a previously appointed personal representative incident to a formal testacy proceeding. The above section describes a remedy which is available for any cause against a previously appointed personal representative, whether appointed formally or informally.
      </p>
      <p>
       This remedy, in combination with the safeguards relating to the process for appointment of a personal representative, permit “control” of a personal representative that is believed to be equal, if not superior, to that presently available with respect to “supervised” personal representatives appointed by inferior courts. The request for a restraining order may mark the beginning of a new proceeding, but the personal representative, by the consent provided in section 30.1-17-02, is practically in the position of one who, on motion, may be cited to appear before a judge.

      Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in sections 30.1-17-09 through <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-12" target="_self">30.1-17-12</a></cite>.

Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination, or relieve the personal representative of the duty to preserve assets subject to the personal representative’s control, to account therefor, and to deliver the assets. Termination does not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the personal representative, but terminates the personal representative’s authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding.

       “Termination”, as defined by this and succeeding provisions, provides definiteness respecting when the powers of a personal representative (who may or may not be discharged by court order) terminate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is to be noted that this section does not relate to jurisdiction over the estate in proceedings which may have been commenced against the personal representative prior to termination. In such cases, a substitution of successor or special representative should occur if the plaintiff desires to maintain his action against the estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that “termination” is not “discharge”. However, an order of the court entered under section 30.1-21-01 or 30.1-21-02 both terminates the appointment of, and discharges, a personal representative.

       A person interested in the estate may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause at any time. Upon filing of the petition, the court shall fix a time and place for hearing. Notice shall be given by the petitioner to the personal representative, and to other persons as the court may order. Except as otherwise ordered as provided in section 30.1-17-07, after receipt of notice of removal proceedings, the personal representative shall not act except to account, to correct maladministration or preserve the estate. If removal is ordered, the court also shall direct by order the disposition of the assets remaining in the name of, or under the control of, the personal representative being removed.

       Cause for removal exists when removal would be in the best interests of the estate, or if it is shown that a personal representative or the person seeking the personal representative’s appointment intentionally misrepresented material facts in the proceedings leading to the personal representative’s appointment, or that the personal representative has disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of discharging the duties of the office, or has mismanaged the estate or failed to perform any duty pertaining to the office. Unless the decedent’s will directs otherwise, a personal representative appointed at the decedent’s domicile, incident to securing appointment of the personal representative or the personal representative’s nominee as ancillary personal representative, may obtain removal of another who was appointed personal representative in this state to administer local assets.

       Thought was given to qualifying subsection 1 above so that no formal removal proceedings could be commenced until after a set period from entry of any previous order reflecting judicial consideration of the qualifications of the personal representative. It was decided, however, that the matter should be left to the judgment of interested persons and the court.

      Except as otherwise ordered in formal proceedings, the probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of a personal representative in intestacy or under a will which is superseded by formal probate of another will, or the vacation of an informal probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of the personal representative thereunder, does not terminate the appointment of the personal representative although the personal representative’s powers may be reduced as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-01" target="_self">30.1-15-01</a></cite>.

      <p>
       This section and section 30.1-15-01 describe the relationship between formal or informal proceedings which change a previous assumption concerning the testacy of the decedent, and a previously appointed personal representative. The basic assumption of both sections is that an appointment, with attendant powers of management, is separable from the basis of appointment; i.e., intestate or testate?; what will is the last will? Hence, a previously appointed personal representative continues to serve in spite of formal or informal proceedings that may give another a prior right to serve as personal representative. But, if the testacy status is changed in formal proceedings, the petitioner also may request appointment of the person who would be entitled to serve if his assumption concerning the decedent’s will prevails. Provision is made for a situation where all interested persons are content to allow a previously appointed personal representative to continue to serve even though another has a prior right because of a change relating to the decedent’s will. It is not necessary for the continuing representative to seek reappointment under the new assumption for section 30.1-18-03 is broad enough to require him to administer the estate as intestate, or under a later probated will, if either status is established after he was appointed. Under section 30.1-15-03, notice of a formal testacy proceeding is required to be given to any previously appointed personal representative. Hence, the testacy status cannot be changed without notice to a previously appointed personal representative.

       The appointment of a special administrator other than one appointed pending original appointment of a general personal representative must be handled by the court. Appointment of a special administrator would enable the estate to participate in a transaction which the general personal representative could not, or should not, handle because of conflict of interest. If a need arises because of temporary absence or anticipated incapacity for delegation of the authority of a personal representative, the problem may be handled without judicial intervention by use of the delegation powers granted to personal representatives by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-18s30.1-18-16" target="_self">30.1-18-16</a></cite>.

       In some areas of the country, particularly where wills cannot be probated without full notice and hearing, appointment of special administrators pending probate is sought almost routinely. The provisions of this Code concerning informal probate should reduce the number of cases in which a fiduciary will need to be appointed pending probate of a will. Nonetheless, there will be instances where contests begin before probate and where it may be necessary to appoint a special administrator. The objective of this section is to reduce the likelihood that contestants will be encouraged to file contests as early as possible simply to gain some advantage via having a person who is sympathetic to their cause appointed special administrator. Most will contests are not successful. Hence, it seems reasonable to prefer the named executor as special administrator where he is otherwise qualified.

     <p>
      The duties and powers of a personal representative commence upon appointment. The powers of a personal representative relate back in time to give acts by the person appointed which are beneficial to the estate occurring prior to appointment the same effect as those occurring thereafter. Prior to appointment, a person named executor in a will may carry out written instructions of the decedent relating to the decedent’s body, funeral, and burial arrangements. A personal representative may ratify and accept acts on behalf of the estate done by others if the acts would have been proper for a personal representative.

       This section codifies the doctrine that the authority of a personal representative relates back to death from the moment it arises. It also makes it clear that authority of a personal representative stems from his appointment. The sentence concerning ratification is designed to eliminate technical questions that might arise concerning the validity of acts done by others prior to appointment. Section 30.1-18-15, subsection 21, relates to delegation of authority after appointment. The third sentence accepts an idea found in the Illinois Probate Act, § 79 [S.H.A. ch. 3, § 79].

      A person to whom general letters are issued first has exclusive authority under the letters until the appointment is terminated or modified. If, through error, general letters are afterward issued to another, the first appointed representative may recover any property of the estate in the hands of the representative subsequently appointed, but the acts of the latter done in good faith before notice of the first letters are not void for want of validity of appointment.

      <p>
       The qualification relating to “modification” of an appointment is intended to refer to the change that may occur in respect to the exclusive authority of one with letters upon later appointment of a co-representative or of a special administrator. The sentence concerning erroneous dual appointment is derived from recent New York legislation. See section 704, Surrogate’s Court Procedure Act [McKinney’s SCPA 704].
      </p>
      <p>
       Erroneous appointment of a second personal representative is possible if formal proceedings after notice are employed. It might be desirable for a state to promulgate a system whereby a notation of letters issued by each county probate office would be relayed to a central record keeping office which, in turn, could indicate to any other office whether letters for a particular decedent, perhaps identified by social security number, had been issued previously. The problem can arise even though notice to known interested persons and by publication is involved.

       A personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees. A personal representative is under a duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of any probated and effective will and this title, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate. The personal representative shall use the authority conferred upon the personal representative by this title, the terms of the will, if any, and any order in proceedings to which the personal representative is party for the best interests of successors to the estate.

       A personal representative may not be surcharged for acts of administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time. Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will authorizes a personal representative to administer and distribute the estate according to its terms. An order of appointment of a personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal proceedings, authorizes the personal representative to distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the decedent if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning the personal representative’s appointment or fitness to continue, or a supervised administration proceeding.

       This and the next section are specially important sections for they state the basic theory underlying the duties and powers of personal representatives. Whether or not a personal representative is supervised, this section applies to describe the relationship he bears to interested parties. If a supervised representative is appointed, or if supervision of a previously appointed personal representative is ordered, an additional obligation to the court is created. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-16s30.1-16-01" target="_self">30.1-16-01</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fundamental responsibility is that of a trustee. Unlike many trustees, a personal representative’s authority is derived from appointment by the public agency known as the court. But, the Code also makes it clear that the personal representative, in spite of the source of his authority, is to proceed with the administration, settlement, and distribution of the estate by use of statutory powers and in accordance with statutory directions. See sections 30.1-12-07 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-18s30.1-18-04" target="_self">30.1-18-04</a></cite>. Subsection 2 is particularly important, for it ties the question of personal liability for administrative or distributive acts to the question of whether the act was “authorized at the time”. Thus, a personal representative may rely upon and be protected by a will which has been probated without adjudication or an order appointing him to administer which is issued in no-notice proceedings even though proceedings occurring later may change the assumption as to whether the decedent died testate or intestate. See section 30.1-14-02 concerning the status of a will probated without notice and section 30.1-12-02 concerning the ineffectiveness of an unprobated will. However, it does not follow from the fact that the personal representative distributed under authority that the distributees may not be liable to restore the property or values received if the assumption concerning testacy is later changed. See sections 30.1-20-09 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-04" target="_self">30.1-21-04</a></cite>. Thus, a distribution may be “authorized at the time” within the meaning of this section, but be “improper” under the latter section.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection 3 is designed to reduce or eliminate differences in the amenability to suit of personal representatives appointed under this Code and under traditional assumptions. Also, the subsection states that so far as the law of the appointing forum is concerned, personal representatives are subject to suit in other jurisdictions. It, together with various provisions of Article IV, are designed to eliminate many of the present reasons for ancillary administrations.

        Where personal representative improperly prepared and filed estate tax returns, failed to properly distribute estate assets, caused overdraft and service charges against estate accounts, and paid himself unreasonable and excessive attorney fees, fiduciary duty imposed by this section was breached.

        Because a personal representative could be an interested person, petitioner was not precluded from filing petitions as an interested person in the formal supervised probate administration while simultaneously performing her fiduciary duty as the personal representative to distribute the property according to the decedent’s will and the best interests of the estate.

      Not later than thirty days after appointment, every personal representative, except any special administrator, shall give information of the appointment to the heirs and devisees, including, if there has been no formal testacy proceeding and if the personal representative was appointed on the assumption that the decedent died intestate, the devisees in any will mentioned in the application for appointment of a personal representative. The information must be delivered or sent by ordinary mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative. The duty does not extend to require information to persons who have been adjudicated in a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate. The information must include the name and address of the personal representative, indicate that it is being sent to persons who have or may have some interest in the estate being administered, indicate whether bond has been filed, and describe the court where papers relating to the estate are on file. The information must state that the estate is being administered by the personal representative under this title without supervision by the court, but that recipients are entitled to information regarding the administration from the personal representative and may petition the court in any matter relating to the estate, including distribution of assets and expenses of administration. The personal representative’s failure to give this information is a breach of duty to the persons concerned but does not affect the validity of the appointment, the personal representative’s powers, or other duties. A personal representative may inform other persons of the appointment by delivery or ordinary first-class mail.

       This section requires the personal representative to inform persons who appear to have an interest in the estate as it is being administered, of his appointment. Also, it requires the personal representative to give notice to persons who appear to be disinherited by the assumption concerning testacy under which the personal representative was appointed. The communication involved is not to be confused with the notice requirements relating to litigation. The duty applies even though there may have been a prior testacy proceeding after notice, except that persons who have been adjudicated to be without interest in the estate are excluded. The rights, if any, of persons in regard to estates cannot be cut off completely except by the running of the three-year statute of limitations provided in section 30.1-12-08, or by a formal judicial proceeding which will include full notice to all interested persons. The interests of some persons may be shifted from rights to specific property of the decedent to the proceeds from sale thereof, or to rights to values received by distributees. However, such a shift of protected interest from one thing to another, or to funds or obligations, is not new in relation to trust beneficiaries. A personal representative may initiate formal proceedings to determine whether persons, other than those appearing to have interests, may be interested in the estate, under section 30.1-15-01 or, in connection with a formal closing, as provided by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-01" target="_self">30.1-21-01</a></cite>.

       This and the following sections eliminate the practice now required by many probate statutes under which the judge is involved in the selection of appraisers. If the personal representative breaches his duty concerning the inventory, he may be removed. Section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-11" target="_self">30.1-17-11</a></cite>. Or, an interested person seeking to surcharge a personal representative for losses incurred as a result of his administration might be able to take advantage of any breach of duty concerning inventory. The section provides two ways in which a personal representative may handle an inventory. [North Dakota provision varies from UPC section.] If the personal representative elects to send copies to all interested persons who request it, information concerning the assets of the estate need not become a part of the records of the probate court. The alternative procedure is to file the inventory with the court. This procedure would be indicated in estates with large numbers of interested persons, where the burden of sending copies to all would be substantial. The court’s rule in respect to the second alternative is simply to receive and file the inventory with the file relating to the estate. See section 30.1-13-04, which permits any interested person to demand notice of any document relating to an estate which may be filed with the court.

       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended elimination of the word “or” that separated the language dealing with the duty to send a copy of the inventory to interested persons requesting it, from the final part of the paragraph dealing with filing of the original. The purpose of the change was to prevent a literal interpretation of the original text that would have permitted a personal representative who filed the original inventory with the Court to avoid compliance with requests for copies from interested persons.

The request by a personal representative for delivery of any property possessed by an heir or devisee is conclusive evidence, in any action against the heir or devisee for possession thereof, that the possession of the property by the personal representative is necessary for purposes of administration. The personal representative shall pay taxes on, and take all steps reasonably necessary for the management, protection, and preservation of, the estate in the personal representative’s possession.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 30.1-12-01 provides for the devolution of title on death. Section 30.1-18-12 defines the status of the personal representative with reference to “title” and “power” in a way that should make it unnecessary to discuss the “title” to decedent’s assets which his personal representative acquires. This section deals with the personal representative’s duty and right to possess assets. It proceeds from the assumption that it is desirable whenever possible to avoid disruption of possession of the decedent’s assets by his devisees or heirs. But, if the personal representative decides that possession of an asset is necessary or desirable for purposes of administration, his judgment is made conclusive in any action for possession that he may need to institute against an heir or devisee. It may be possible for an heir or devisee to question the judgment of the personal representative in later action for surcharge for breach of fiduciary duty, but this possibility should not interfere with the personal representative’s administrative authority as it relates to possession of the estate.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Code follows the Model Probate Code in regard to partnership interests. In the introduction to the Model Probate Code, the following appears at p. 22:
      </p>
      <p>
       “No provisions for the administration of partnership estates when a partner dies have been included. Several states have statutes providing that unless the surviving partner files a bond with the probate court, the personal representative of the deceased partner may administer the partnership estate upon giving an additional bond. Kan.Gen.Stat. (Supp.1943) §§ 59-1001 to 59-1005; Mo. Rev.Stat.Ann. (1942) §§ 81 to 93 [V.A. M.S. §§ 473.220 to 473.230]. In these states the administration of partnership estates upon the death of a partner is brought more or less completely under the jurisdiction of the probate court. While the provisions afford security to parties in interest, they have caused complications in the settlement of partnership estates and have produced much litigation. Woener, Administration (3rd ed., 1923) §§ 128 to 130; annotation, 121 A.L.R. 860. These statutes have been held to be inconsistent with Section 37 of the Uniform Partnership Act providing for winding up by the surviving partner. Davis v. Hutchinson, 36 F.2d 309 (CCA-9, 1929). Hence the Model Probate Code contains no provision regarding partnership property except for inclusion in the inventory of the decedent’s proportionate share of any partnership. See § 120. However, it is suggested that the Uniform Partnership Act should be included in the statutes of the states which have not already enacted it”.

        Personal representative of decedent’s estate has authority to lease estate property for the benefit of joint devisees, and his decision to take possession of the property for administration purposes is conclusive against heirs and devisees, whom he may evict from the property. Schmidt v. Schmidt, 1997 ND 44, 560 N.W.2d 886, 1997 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1997).

        Title to property passes to a decedent's heirs or devisees at death, subject to a personal representative's broad powers over the title for administration purposes; a personal representative is allowed to lease and sell estate property if acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons. Therefore, although a personal representative might have been acting reasonably when she leased farmland, an income-producing asset of the estate, there was insufficient analysis or supporting evidence presented on the issue.

       An heir could not maintain a suit for partition against other heirs and the administrator in district court after the county court had assumed jurisdiction to probate and administer the estate, and had appointed an administrator for that purpose, and before a final decree of distribution had been made in the county court.

      </p>
      <p>
       For purposes of administration where there had been a judgment in favor of estate in proceeding to determine adverse claims between executor and heirs at law, such judgment should have quieted title in heirs at law and in executor. Druey v. Baldwin, 41 N.D. 473, 172 N.W. 663, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 104</cite> (N.D.), different results reached on reh'g, 41 N.D. 473, 182 N.W. 700, 1919 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

       The personal representative is given the broadest possible “power over title”. He receives a “power”, rather than title, because the power concept eases the succession of assets which are not possessed by the personal representative. Thus, if the power is unexercised prior to its termination, its lapse clears the title of devisees and heirs. Purchasers from devisees or heirs who are “distributees” may be protected also by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-20s30.1-20-10" target="_self">30.1-20-10</a></cite>. The power over title of an absolute owner is conceived to embrace all possible transactions which might result in a conveyance or encumbrance of assets, or in a change of rights of possession. The relationship of the personal representative to the estate is that of a trustee. Hence, personal creditors or successors of a personal representative cannot avail themselves of his title to any greater extent than is true generally of creditors and successors of trustees. Interested persons who are apprehensive of possible misuse of power by a personal representative may secure themselves by use of the devices implicit in the several sections of chapters 30.1-12 and 30.1-14 of this Article. See especially sections 30.1-16-01, 30.1-17-05, 30.1-17-07, and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-11" target="_self">30.1-17-11</a></cite>.

       An interested person has two principal remedies to forestall a personal representative from committing a breach of fiduciary duty. 1. Under section 30.1-17-07 he may apply to the court for an order restraining the personal representative from performing any specified act or from exercising any power in the course of administration. 2. Under section 30.1-17-11 he may petition the court for an order removing the personal representative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of a proceeding, or order, restraining a personal representative from selling, leasing, encumbering, or otherwise affecting title to real property subject to administration, if properly recorded under the laws of this state, would be effective to prevent a purchaser from acquiring a marketable title under the usual rules relating to recordation of real property titles.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, sections 30.1-02-02 and 30.1-12-05 authorize joinder of third persons who may be involved in contemplated transactions with a personal representative in proceedings to restrain a personal representative under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-07" target="_self">30.1-17-07</a></cite>.

       If a personal representative violates the duty against self-dealing described by this section, a voidable title to assets sold results. Other breaches of duty relating to sales of assets will not cloud titles except as to purchasers with actual knowledge of the breach. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-18s30.1-18-14" target="_self">30.1-18-14</a></cite>. The principles of bona fide purchase would protect a purchaser for value without notice of defect in the seller’s title arising from conflict of interest.

    Persons dealing with personal representative — Protection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who in good faith either assists a personal representative or deals with the personal representative for value is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised the personal representative’s power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise. Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 30.1-16-04, no provision in any will or order of court purporting to limit the power of a personal representative is effective except as to persons with actual knowledge thereof. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a personal representative. The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged decedent is found to be alive. The protection here expressed is not in substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

       This section qualifies the effect of a provision in a will which purports to prohibit sale of property by a personal representative. The provisions of a will may prescribe the duties of a personal representative and subject him to surcharge or other remedies of interested persons if he disregards them. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-18s30.1-18-03" target="_self">30.1-18-03</a></cite>. But, the will’s prohibition is not relevant to the rights of a purchaser unless he had actual knowledge of its terms. Interested persons who want to prevent a personal representative from having the power described here must use the procedures described in chapter 30.1-16. Each state will need to identify the relation between this section and other statutory provisions creating liens on estate assets for inheritance and other taxes. The section cannot control whether a purchaser takes free of the lien of unpaid federal estate taxes. Hence, purchasers from personal representatives appointed pursuant to this Code will have to satisfy themselves concerning whether estate taxes are paid, and if not paid, whether the tax lien follows the property they are acquiring. See section 6234, Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C.A. § 6324].
      </p>
      <p>
       The impact of formal recording systems beyond the usual probate procedure depends upon the particular statute. In states in which the recording system provides for recording wills as muniments of title, statutory adaptation should be made to provide that recording of wills should be postponed until the validity has been established by probate or limitation. Statutory limitation to this effect should be added to statutes which do not so provide to avoid conflict with power of the personal representative during administration. The purpose of the Code is to make the deed or instrument of distribution the usual muniment of title. See sections 30.1-20-07, 30.1-20-08, <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-20s30.1-20-10" target="_self">30.1-20-10</a></cite>. However, this is not available when no administration has occurred and in that event reliance upon general recording statutes must be had.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a state continues to permit wills to be recorded as muniments of title, the above section would need to be qualified to give effect to the notice from recording.

        Editorial Board Comment.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section accepts the assumption of the Uniform Trustee’s Powers Act that it is desirable to equip fiduciaries with the authority required for the prudent handling of assets and extends it to personal representatives. The section requires that a personal representative act reasonably and for the benefit of the interested person. Subject to this and to the other qualifications described by the preliminary statement, the enumerated transactions are made authorized transactions for personal representatives. Subsections 18 and 27 support the other provisions of the Code, particularly section 30.1-18-04, which contemplates that personal representatives will proceed with all of the business of administration without court orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       In part, subsection 4 involves a substantive question of whether noncontractual charitable pledges of a decedent can be honored by his personal representative. It is believed, however, that it is not desirable from a practical standpoint to make much turn on whether a charitable pledge is, or is not, contractual. Pledges are rarely made the subject of claims. The effect of subsection 4 is to permit the personal representative to discharge pledges where he believes the decedent would have wanted him to do so without exposing himself to surcharge. The holder of a contractual pledge may, of course, pursue the remedies of a creditor. If a pledge provides that the obligation ceases on the death of the pledgor, no personal representative would be safe in assuming that the decedent would want the pledge completed under the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection 3 is not intended to affect the right to performance or to damages of any person who contracted with the decedent. To do so would constitute an unreasonable interference with private rights. The intention of the subsection is simply to give a personal representative who is obligated to carry out a decedent’s contracts the same alternatives in regard to the contractual duties which the decedent had prior to his death.

        A personal representative is empowered to employ attorneys to assist in administration and to pay the compensation of the personal representative, and other expenses incident to the administration of the estate. This compensation includes reasonable attorneys’ fees to defend or prosecute any proceeding in good faith. In re Estate of O'Connell, 476 N.W.2d 8, 1991 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1991).

       <p>
        Under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-18-15(21), the personal representative was entitled to reasonable compensation for his services rendered as the tasks required substantial time and effort and could not have been easily delegated to a third-party.

        When the will directs that estate property is to be sold, without fixing specific time limits for such sale, the personal representative must sell the property within a reasonable time in the best interest of the estate. In re Estate of Rolczynski, 349 N.W.2d 394, 1984 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 311</cite> (N.D. 1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Title to property passes to a decedent's heirs or devisees at death, subject to a personal representative's broad powers over the title for administration purposes; a personal representative is allowed to lease and sell estate property if acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons. Therefore, although a personal representative might have been acting reasonably when she leased farmland, an income-producing asset of the estate, there was insufficient analysis or supporting evidence presented on the issue. In re Estate of Johnson, 2015 ND 110, 863 N.W.2d 215, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2015).

       The death of the defendant before the rendition of a judgment against him dissolved garnishment proceedings in the action against the defendant. First Nat'l Bank v. Rohlik, 66 N.D. 72, 262 N.W. 458, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1935).

       An administrator could maintain an action founded on contract in the same court in which the action could have been maintained by the intestate. McDonald v. First Nat'l Bank, 58 N.D. 49, 224 N.W. 676, 1929 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 179</cite> (N.D. 1929).
      </p>
      <p>
       An administrator could maintain an action founded on contract without obtaining permission of the county court, the actions requiring the direction of the county court being limited to those specified by law.

      </p>
      <p>
       An action on a note was not abated by defendant’s death before trial, so a personal representative was properly substituted as a party defendant. First Nat'l Bank v. Rohlik, 66 N.D. 72, 262 N.W. 458, 1935 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1935).

      <p>
       Where a motion to substitute a personal representative for a deceased party in a pending action was resisted on the ground that the cause of action did not survive, there was inherent in the court’s decision on the motion a question of substantial rights as to whether the cause of action survived the death, which intrinsically involved the merits of the action, and an order granting the motion and directing the substitution was appealable under N.D.C.C. § 28-27-02(5). Missouri Slope Livestock Auction v. Wachter, 113 N.W.2d 222, 1962 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 57</cite> (N.D. 1962), overruled in part, Investors Title Ins. Co. v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the death of a party to an action that survived and the appointment of a legal representative of the deceased party were established or conceded, a motion to substitute the representative of the party could not be successfully resisted on the ground that an event occurring subsequent to death constituted a bar to the action.

    Corepresentatives — When joint action required.

     <p>
      If two or more persons are appointed corepresentatives and unless the will provides otherwise, the concurrence of all is required on all acts connected with the administration and distribution of the estate. This restriction does not apply when any corepresentative receives and receipts for property due the estate, when the concurrence of all cannot readily be obtained in the time reasonably available for emergency action necessary to preserve the estate, or when a corepresentative has been delegated to act for the others. Persons dealing with a corepresentative, if actually unaware that another has been appointed to serve with the corepresentative or if advised by the personal representative with whom they deal that the representative has authority to act alone for any of the reasons mentioned herein, are as fully protected as if the person with whom they dealt had been the sole personal representative.

      <p>
       With certain qualifications, this section is designed to compel corepresentatives to agree on all matters relating to administration when circumstances permit. Delegation by one to another representative is a form of concurrence in acts that may result from the delegation. A corepresentative who abdicates his responsibility to coadminister the estate by a blanket delegation breaches his duty to interested persons as described by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-18s30.1-18-03" target="_self">30.1-18-03</a></cite>. Section 30.1-18-15, subsection 21, authorizes some limited delegations, which are reasonable and for the benefit of interested persons.

       Source, Model Probate Code section 102. This section applies where one of two or more corepresentatives dies, becomes disabled, or is removed. In regard to coexecutors, it is based on the assumption that the decedent would not consider the powers of his fiduciaries to be personal, or to be suspended if one or more could not function. In regard to coadministrators in intestacy, it is based on the idea that the reason for appointing more than one ceases on the death or disability of either of them.

     <p>
      A personal representative is entitled to reasonable compensation for the personal representative’s services. If a will provides for compensation of the personal representative and there is no contract with the decedent regarding compensation, the personal representative may renounce the provision before qualifying and be entitled to reasonable compensation. A personal representative also may renounce the personal representative’s right to all or any part of the compensation. A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court.

        District court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant’s request for personal representative’s fees and attorney’s fees.

        Personal representative did not present any invoices, statements, cancelled checks, itemizations, or other documentation substantiating the requested fees; the children failed to meet their burden to affirmatively establish that the district court abused its discretion in determining a reasonable amount of additional personal representative’s fees and attorney’s fees.

        It was not an abuse of discretion to award a personal representative personal representative's fees because the trial court recognized (1) the extensive volume of work done by the personal representative for the estate and (2) that the actions taken by the personal representative were all done in good faith.

       Fact that inventory specified certain property as homestead did not exclude such property from estate of decedent for purposes of determining executor’s compensation. In re Novak's Estate, 73 N.D. 41, 11 N.W.2d 64, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not erroneous for the court to compute the executor’s commission upon the total inventoried value of the estate, less the exempt personal property. In re Novak's Estate, 73 N.D. 41, 11 N.W.2d 64, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 60</cite> (N.D. 1943).

      </p>
      <p>
       Litigation prosecuted by a personal representative for the primary purpose of enhancing his prospects for compensation would not be in good faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       A personal representative is a fiduciary for successors of the estate (section 30.1-18-03). Though the will naming him may not yet be probated, the priority for appointment conferred by section 30.1-13-03 on one named executor in a probated will means that the person named has an interest, as a fiduciary, in seeking the probate of the will. Hence, he is an interested person within the meaning of sections 30.1-14-01 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-01" target="_self">30.1-15-01</a></cite>. Section 30.1-20-12 gives the successors of an estate control over the executor, provided all are competent adults. So, if all persons possibly interested in the probate of a will, including trustees of any trusts created thereby, concur in directing the named executor to refrain from efforts to probate the instrument, he would lose standing to proceed. All of these observations apply with equal force to the case where the named executor of one instrument seeks to contest the probate of another instrument. Thus, the Code changes the idea followed in some jurisdictions that an executor lacks standing to contest other wills which, if valid, would supersede the will naming him, and standing to oppose other contests that may be mounted against the instrument nominating him.

         Allowance of Reasonable Attorney Fees.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section specifically provides that ultimate success in legal proceedings is not a prerequisite to the allowance of reasonable attorney fees. In re Estate of Flaherty, 484 N.W.2d 515, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Award of attorney fees to a personal representative was not an abuse of discretion because, while the amount awarded was large, the court gave a reasoned explanation, including (1) consideration of the “lodestar” rate, and (2) the fact the case involved lengthy evidentiary hearings and issues related to reconstructing financial records and tracing crop-share proceeds and cash rent over several years for farmland in contentious litigation. Hogen v. Hogen (Estate of Hogen), 2015 ND 125, 863 N.W.2d 876, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 125</cite> (N.D. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court's decision approving the personal representative fees and attorney's fees was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable where many of the residuary devisees' arguments regarding the payment of fees relates to their allegation that the representative breached her fiduciary duties in selling the farmland to a grandson, the court had previously held that the representative had the power to sell the farmland, and the case had been ongoing for a long time. Mark v. Johnson (In re Estate of Johnson), 2017 ND 162, 897 N.W.2d 921, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 162</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the estate’s attorney’s fees where the Estate incurred significant attorney’s fees and costs in defending the petitions filed by the decedent’s son and the decedent’s estranged husband while the claims were pending for years. In re Estate of Albrecht, 2020 ND 27, 938 N.W.2d 151, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 27</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       <p>
        Person named as personal representative in a will was not entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs for his unsuccessful attempt to probate the will where the will was not admitted to probate because of lack of testamentary capacity of the testator, the person initiated the probate proceeding in the hope of personal gain and without any intent to benefit the estate, and the person exercised undue influence over the testator in executing the will; under such circumstances, the person was not entitled to any presumption that he offered the will for probate in good faith. In re Estate of Honerud, 326 N.W.2d 95, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 375</cite> (N.D. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since an attorney employed by a beneficiary usually seeks to benefit only his or her client and not the entire estate, regardless of professed motives or resulting outcome, attorney fees are disallowed. In re Estate of Rohrich, 496 N.W.2d 566, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 34</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the personal representative attacked the trust’s creation, acting primarily to benefit his own interests, he was not entitled to collect attorney fees. First Nat'l Bank v. City of Larimore (In re Oliver), 540 N.W.2d 630, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion in reducing attorney’s fees by amount spent on activities that did nothing to benefit an estate or assist in an appeal. First Nat'l Bank v. City of Larimore (In re Oliver), 540 N.W.2d 630, 1995 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 226</cite> (N.D. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not abuse its discretion by denying appellant’s request for personal representative’s fees and attorney’s fees. The district court found the litigation costs and a substantial portion of the attorney’s fees were more in pursuit of appellant’s own personal interests than the estate’s interests. Sande v. Sande (In re Estate of Sande), 2020 ND 125, 943 N.W.2d 826, 2020 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 116</cite> (N.D. 2020).

       <p>
        In construing this section, it must appear that the personal representative acted in good faith, that his conduct was free from fraud, and that he benefited the estate before attorney fees and costs may be awarded by the court. A “benefit” to an estate certainly includes services that bring about an enhancement in value or an increase in the assets of the estate. In re Estate of Flaherty, 484 N.W.2d 515, 1992 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 96</cite> (N.D. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A “benefit” to the estate is not to be measured solely in monetary terms, but can also include a personal representative’s good faith attempts to effectuate the testamentary intention set forth in a facially valid will.

        District court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the surviving spouse administration costs and attorney’s fees where her pursuit of an elective share from the estate was congruent with the decedent’s testamentary intent to provide for the spouse during her lifetime.

        Even though district court did not find personal representative had acted in bad faith, court did not err in denying personal representative’s request that attorney fees be paid by the estate rather than from his personal funds where such fees were incurred in defending the validity of joint tenancies with right of survivorship between the personal representative and the deceased which defense, if successful, would have had the effect of making the joint tenancy property the property of the personal representative rather than property of the estate.

      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the broad jurisdiction conferred on the probate court by section 30.1-12-05, description of the special proceeding authorized by this section might be unnecessary. But, the Code’s theory that personal representatives may fix their own fees and those of estate attorneys marks an important departure from much existing practice under which fees are determined by the court in the first instance. Hence, it seemed wise to emphasize that any interested person can get judicial review of fees if he desires it. Also, if excessive fees have been paid, this section provides a quick and efficient remedy.

        Attorney seeking compensation from personal representative of an estate must have rendered some necessary or beneficial legal services, there must be some evidence that such services were rendered, and the compensation therefor must be reasonable. In re Estate of Vertin, 381 N.W.2d 199, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        Even without a challenge under this section, a personal representative may pay out of the estate only reasonable attorney fees, for which there must be some basis. In re Estate of Vertin, 381 N.W.2d 199, 1986 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 256</cite> (N.D. 1986).

        District court did not err in ordering an attorney to repay the fees he charged in the administration of an estate because there was sufficient evidence suggesting that the fees were unreasonable; the district court did not misinterpret or misapply the law in holding the attorney personally responsible for the unreasonable fees he charged because it considered the evidence and testimony before it and determined that the fees he collected in his service to the estate were unreasonable.

      General Editorial Board Comment.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The need for uniformity of law regarding creditors’ claims against estates is especially strong. Commercial and consumer credit depends upon efficient collection procedures. The cost of credit is pushed up by the cost of credit life insurance which becomes a practical necessity for lenders unwilling to bear the expense of understanding or using the cumbersome and provincial collection procedures found in fifty codes of probate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sections which follow facilitate collection of claims against decedents in several ways. First, a simple written statement mailed to the personal representative is a sufficient “claim”. Allowance of claims is handled by the personal representative and is assumed if a claimant is not advised of disallowance. Also, a personal representative may pay any just claims without presentation and at any time, if he is willing to assume risks which will be minimal in many cases. The period of uncertainty regarding possible claims is only four months from first publication. This should expedite settlement and distribution of estates.

    Notice to creditors.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Unless notice has already been given under this section, a personal representative upon appointment may publish a notice to creditors whose identities are not reasonably ascertainable. The notice must be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. If the personal representative elects to publish a notice to creditors then, in addition to publishing the notice to creditors, the personal representative shall mail a copy of the notice to those creditors whose identities are known to the personal representative or are reasonably ascertainable and who have not already filed a claim. The notice must announce the personal representative’s appointment and address and notify creditors of the estate to present their claims within three months after the date of the first publication or mailing of the notice or be forever barred. For the purpose of this section, a reasonably ascertainable creditor includes a creditor who regularly submits billings to the decedent or the decedent’s estate and to whose billings the personal representative has had access.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 30.1-23-03, relating to small estates, contains an important qualification on the duty created by this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1989, the Joint Editorial Board recommended replacement of the word “shall” with “[may] [shall]” in (a) [first sentence of North Dakota’s provision] to signal its approval of a choice between mandatory publication and optional publication of notice to creditors to be made by the legislature in an enacting state. Publication of notice to creditors is quite expensive in some populous areas of the country and, if Tulsa Professional Collection Services v. Pope, 108 S. Ct. 1340, 485 U.S. 478 (1988) applies to this code, is useless except to bar unknown creditors. Even if Pope does not apply, personal representatives for estates involving successors willing to assume the risk of unbarred claims should have (and have had under the code as a practical consequence of absence of Court supervision and mandatory closings) the option of failing to publish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional discussion of the impact of Pope on the Code appears in the Comment to Section 3-803 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-03], infra.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a state elects to make publication of notice to creditors a duty for personal representatives, failure to advertise for claims would involve a breach of duty on the part of the personal representative. If, as a result of such breach, a claim is later asserted against a distributee under Section 3-1004 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-21-04], the personal representative may be liable to the distributee for costs related to discharge of the claim and the recovery of contribution from other distributees. The protection afforded personal representatives under Section 3-1003 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-21-03] would not be available, for that section applies only if the personal representative truthfully recites that the time limit for presentation of claims has expired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Putting aside Pope case concerns regarding state action under this code, it might be appropriate, by legislation, to channel publications through the personnel of the probate Court. See Section 1-401 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-03-01]. If notices are controlled by a centralized authority, some assurance could be gained against publication in newspapers of small circulation. Also, the form of notices could be made uniform and certain efficiencies could be achieved. For example, it would be compatible with this section for the Court to publish a single notice each day or each week listing the names of personal representatives appointed since the last publication, with addresses and dates of non-claim.

      <p>
       Definition of “reasonably ascertainable creditor” in N.D.C.C. § 30.1-19-01 did not exclude a creditor who submitted a bill to a decedent’s guardian, rather than to the decedent or the estate, because such an exclusion would be contrary to due process and to the principle that the term “includes” in a definition is a word of enlargement and not a term of limitation.

       Wrongful death action under N.D.C.C. § 32-21-01 was barred by the probate code nonclaim provisions under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-19-03(1)-(3) because the representative was not a reasonably ascertainable creditor entitled to actual notice under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-19-01 when she told the representative of the pilot’s estate that no tort claims would be pursued, the claims were not filed within three months of the pilot’s death, and the nonclaim provisions were not subject to the tolling provisions of N.D.C.C. § 28-01-25(1) during the children’s minority.

    Statutes of limitations.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Unless an estate is insolvent, the personal representative, with the consent of all successors whose interests would be affected, may waive any defense of limitations available to the estate. If the defense is not waived, no claim that was barred by any statute of limitations at the time of the decedent’s death may be allowed or paid. The running of any statute of limitations measured from some other event than death and advertisement and mailing of notice for claims against a decedent is suspended during the three months following the decedent’s death but resumes thereafter as to claims not barred pursuant to the sections which follow. For purposes of any statute of limitations, the proper presentation of a claim under section 30.1-19-04 is equivalent to commencement of a proceeding on the claim.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section means that four months [three months under North Dakota’s provision] is added to the normal period of limitations by reason of a debtor’s death before a debt is barred. It implies also that after the expiration of four months [three months under North Dakota’s provision] from death, the normal statute of limitations may run and bar a claim even though the nonclaim provisions of section 30.1-19-03 have not been triggered. Hence, the nonclaim and limitation provisions of section 30.1-19-03 are not exclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be noted that under sections 30.1-19-03 and 30.1-19-04 it is possible for a claim to be barred by the process of claim, disallowance, and failure by the creditor to commence a proceeding to enforce his claim prior to the end of the four-month suspension period. Thus, the regular statute of limitations applicable during the debtor’s lifetime, the nonclaim provisions of sections 30.1-19-03 and 30.1-19-04, and the three-year limitation of section 30.1-19-03 all have potential application to a claim. The first of the three to accomplish a bar controls.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended a change that makes it clear that only those successors who would be affected thereby, must agree to a waiver of a defense of limitations available to an estate. As the original text stood, the section appeared to require the consent of “all successors,” even though this would include some who, under the rules of abatement, could not possibly be affected by allowance and payment of the claim in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1989, in connection with other amendments recommended in sequel to Tulsa Professional Collection Services v. Pope, 108 S. Ct. 1340, 485 U.S. 478 (1988), the Joint Editorial Board recommended the splitting out, into Subsections (b) and (c), of the last two sentences of what formerly was a four-sentence section [this change was not made in the North Dakota provision]. The first two sentences now appear as Subsection (a). The rearrangement aids understanding that the section deals with three separable ideas. No other change in language is involved, and the timing of the changes to coincide with Pope case amendments is purely coincidental.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There was some disagreement among the Reporters over whether a short period of limitations, or of non-claim, should be provided for claims arising at or after death. Subparagraph (b) [part of (1)(a) in North Dakota provision] was finally inserted because most felt it was desirable to accelerate the time when unadjudicated distributions would be final. The time limits stated would not, of course, affect any personal liability in contract, tort, or by statute, of the personal representative. Under Section 3-808 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-08] a personal representative is not liable on transactions entered into on behalf of the estate unless he agrees to be personally liable or unless he breaches a duty by making the contract. Creditors of the estate and not of the personal representative thus face a special limitation that runs four months after performance is due from the personal representative. Tort claims normally will involve casualty insurance of the decedent or of the personal representative, and so will fall within the exception of subparagraph (d) [subparagraph (3)]. If a personal representative is personally at fault in respect to a tort claim arising after the decedent’s death, his personal liability would not be affected by the running of the special short period provided here.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1989, the Joint Editorial Board recommended amendments to Subsection (a) [subsection (1)]. The change in (1) [(1)(b) in North Dakota’s provision] shortens the ultimate limitations period on claims against a decedent from 3 years after death to 1 year after death [this change was not made in North Dakota’s provision]. Corresponding amendments were recommended for Sections 3-1003(a)(1) and 3-1006 [N.D.C.C. §§
   30.1-21-03(1)(a) and 30.1-21-06]. The new one-year from death limitation (which applies without regard to whether or when an estate is opened for administration) is designed to prevent concerns stemming from the possible applicability to this Code of Tulsa Professional Collection Services v. Pope, 108 S. Ct. 1340, 485 U.S. 478 (1988) from unduly prolonging estate settlements and closings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a)(2) [subsection (1)(a)], by reference to 3-801(a) and 3-801(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-01], adds an additional method of barring a prospective claimant of whom the personal representative is aware. The new bar is available when it is appropriate, under all of the circumstances, to send a mailed warning to one or more known claimants who have not presented claims that the recipient’s claim will be barred if not presented within 60 days from the notice. This optional, mailed notice, described in accompanying new text in Section 3-801(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-01, 3rd sentence], is designed to enhance the ability of personal representatives to protect distributees against pass-through liability (under Section 3-1004 [30.1-21-04]) to possibly unbarred claimants. Personal representatives acting in the best interests of successors to the estate (see Section 3-703(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-18-03(1)] and the definition of “successors” in Section 1-201(42) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-06(51)]) may determine that successors are willing to assume risks (i) that Pope, supra, will be held to apply to this Code in spite of absence of any significant contact between an agency of the state and the acts of a personal representative operating independently of Court supervision; and (ii) that a possibly unbarred claim is valid and will be pursued by its owner against estate distributees in time to avoid bar via the earliest to run of its own limitation period (which, under Section 3-802(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-02], resumes running four months after death), or the one-year from death limitation now provided by § 3-803(a)(1) [not adopted by North Dakota]. If publication of notice as provided in Section 3-801 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-01] has occurred and if Pope either is inapplicable to this Code or is applicable but the late-arising claim in question is judged to have been unknown to the personal representative and unlikely to have been discovered by reasonable effort, an earlier, four months from first publication bar will apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Joint Editorial Board recognized that the new bar running one year after death may be used by some sets of successors to avoid payment of claims against their decedents of which they are aware. Successors who are willing to delay receipt and enjoyment of inheritances may consider waiting out the non-claim period running from death simply to avoid any public record of an administration that might alert known and unknown creditors to pursue their claims. The scenario was deemed to be unlikely, however, for unpaid creditors of a decedent are interested persons (Section 1-201(20)) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-01-06] who are qualified to force the opening of an estate for purposes of presenting and enforcing claims. Further, successors who delay opening an administration will suffer from lack of proof of title to estate assets and attendant inability to enjoy their inheritances. Finally, the odds that holders of important claims against the decedent will need help in learning of the death and proper place of administration is rather small. Any benefit to such claimants of additional procedures designed to compel administrations and to locate and warn claimants of an impending non-claim bar, is quite likely to be heavily outweighed by the costs such procedures would impose on all estates, the vast majority of which are routinely applied to quick payment of the decedents’ bills and distributed without any creditor controversy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the new bar described by Section 3-801(b) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-01] and Section 3-803(a)(2) is the earlier of one year from death or the period described by reference to § 3-801(b) and § 3-801(a) in § 3-803(a)(2). If publication of notice is made under § 3-801(a), and the personal representative thereafter gives actual notice to a known creditor, when is the creditor barred? If the actual notice is given less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the four months from first publication period, the claim will not be barred four months after first publication because the actual notice given by § 3-801(b) advises the creditor that it has no less than 60 days to present the claim. It is as if the personal representative gave the claimant a written waiver of any benefit the estate may have had by reason of the four month bar following published notice. (c.f., the ability of a personal representative, under § 3-802 to change claims from allowed to disallowed, and vice versa, and the 60 day period given by § 3-806(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-06(1)] within which a claimant may contest a disallowance). The period ending with the running of 60 days from actual notice replaces the four month from publication period as the “time for original presentation” referred to in Section 3-806(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       Note, too, that if there is no publication of notice as provided in Section 3-801(a), the giving of actual notice to known creditors establishes separate, 60 days from time of notice, non-claim periods for those so notified. The failure to publish also means that no general non-claim period, other than the one year period running from death, will be working for the estate. If an actual notice to a creditor is given before notice by publication is given, a question arises as to whether the 60 day period from actual notice, or the longer, four-month [three-month in North Dakota’s provision] from publication applies. Subsections 3-801(a) and (b), which are pulled into Section 3-803(a)(2) [subsection (1)(a)] by reference, make no distinction between actual notices given before publication and those given after publication. Hence, it would seem that the later time bar would control in either case. This reading also fits more satisfactorily with Section 3-806(a) [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-06(1)] and other code language referring in various contexts to “the time limit prescribed in § 3-803.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The proviso, formerly appended to 3-803(a)(1), regarding the effect in this state of the prior running of a non-claim statute of the decedent’s domicile, has been restated as 3-803(b) [retained in subsection (1)(a) of North Dakota’s provision], and former subsections (b) and (c) have been redesignated as (c) and (d). The relocation of the proviso was made to improve the style of the section. No change of meaning is intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second paragraph of the original comment has been deleted because of inconsistency with amended § 3-803(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1989 changes recommended by the Joint Editorial Board relating to former § 3-803(b) now designated as 3-803(c) [subsection (2)] are unrelated to the Pope case problem. The original text failed to describe a satisfactory non-claim period for claims arising at or after the decedent’s death other than claims based on contract. The four months “after [any other claim] arises” period worked unjustly as to tort claims stemming from accidents causing the decedent’s death by snuffing out claims too quickly, sometimes before an estate had been opened. The language added by the 1989 amendment assures such claimants against any bar working prior to the later of one year after death or four months from the time the claim arises [North Dakota’s provision contains three month and three year bars].
      </p>
      <p>
       The other change affecting what is now § 3-803(d) [subsection (3)] is the addition of a third class of items which are not barred by any time bar running from death, publication of notice to creditors, or any actual notice given to an estate creditor [this addition was not made in the North Dakota provision]. The addition resembles a modification to the Code as enacted in Arizona.

       By technical amendment effective July 31, 1997, the words “and nonprobate transferees” were added to subsection (a) [subsection (1)] to clarify that the Code’s non-claim bar protects probate as well as nonprobate successors against claims of unsatisfied creditors of the decedent. Section 6-101(b) of the original Code, which was replaced by Section 6-102 in 1998, implied that unsatisfied creditors of the decedent had rights to reach nonprobate transferees in payment of allowed claims but imposed no time bar.

       30.1-19-04. (3-804)
    Manner of presentation of claims.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Claims against a decedent’s estate may be presented as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-04ol11">
       The claimant may deliver or mail to the personal representative and any attorney of record for the estate a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed, or may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court. The claim is deemed presented on the first to occur, either receipt of the written statement of claim by the personal representative, or the filing of the claim with the court. If a claim is not yet due, the claimant shall state the date when it will become due. If the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the claimant shall state the nature of the uncertainty. If the claim is secured, the claimant shall describe the security. Failure to describe correctly the security, the nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the presentation.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-04ol12">
       The claimant may commence a proceeding against the personal representative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction, to obtain payment of the claimant’s claim against the estate, but the commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim. A presentation of claim is not required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent which were pending at the time of death.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-04ol13">
       If a claim is presented under subsection 1, a proceeding on the claim may not be commenced more than sixty days after the personal representative has mailed a notice of disallowance, but, in the case of a claim which is not presently due or which is contingent or unliquidated, the personal representative may consent to an extension of the sixty-day period, or to avoid injustice, the court, on petition, may order an extension of the sixty-day period, but in no event may the extension run beyond the applicable statute of limitations.

      </p>
      <p>
       The filing of a claim with the probate court under subsection 2 of this section does not serve to initiate a proceeding concerning the claim. Rather, it serves merely to protect the claimant who may anticipate some need for evidence to show that his claim is not barred. The probate court acts simply as a depository of the statement of claim, as is true of its responsibility for an inventory filed with it under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-18s30.1-18-06" target="_self">30.1-18-06</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In reading this section it is important to remember that a regular statute of limitation may run to bar a claim before the nonclaim provisions run. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-02" target="_self">30.1-19-02</a></cite>.

        North Dakota court should not have tried to resolve the merits of a claim relating to an award of military retirement benefits to a former wife because she was not required to submit a claim against her husband’s estate for such since an action was pending at the time of his death; moreover, if a judgment was entered against a personal representative as a substituted party in the pending California action regarding the retirement benefits, this constituted an allowance of the claim against the former husband’s estate.

        Burden of Proof When Pleading Nonclaim.

      <p>
       The burden of proving the presentation and rejection of a claim against a decedent’s estate, and of a suit begun within ninety days thereof, was upon the plaintiff, whether or not the defendant had answered, pleading the statute of nonclaim. Mann v. Redmon, 27 N.D. 346, 145 N.W. 1031, 1914 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 40</cite> (N.D. 1914).

       As to claims presented in the manner described in section 30.1-19-04 within the time limit prescribed in section 30.1-19-03, the personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been disallowed. If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the personal representative changes the personal representative’s decision concerning the claim, the personal representative shall notify the claimant. The personal representative may not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to commence a proceeding on the claim has run and the claim has been barred. Every claim which is disallowed, in whole or in part, by the personal representative is barred so far as not allowed unless the claimant files a petition for allowance in the court or commences a proceeding against the personal representative not later than sixty days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance if the notice warns the claimant of the impending bar. Failure of the personal representative to mail notice to a claimant of action on the claimant’s claim for sixty days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired has the effect of a notice of allowance.

The personal representative shall notify the claimant of the change to disallowance, and the disallowed claim is then subject to bar as provided under subsection 1. After disallowing a claim, the personal representative may change a disallowance to an allowance in whole or in part until it is barred under subsection 1 and after it is barred, it may be allowed and paid only if the estate is solvent and all successors whose interests would be affected consent.

Notice in this proceeding must be given to the claimant, the personal representative, and those other persons interested in the estate as the court may direct, by order entered at the time the proceeding is commenced.

        Statute providing that defense of statute of limitations could be interposed only by answer had no application to former statute of nonclaim. Mann v. Redmon, 23 N.D. 508, 137 N.W. 478, 1912 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 118</cite> (N.D. 1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to set statute of limitations in motion, notice of rejection had to be given by registered mail, and the fact that notice reached claimant or his attorney by some means other than registered mail was not sufficient to start operation of statute. Quinn Wire &amp; Iron Works v. Boyd, 52 N.D. 273, 202 N.W. 852, 1924 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 131</cite> (N.D. 1924).

        Where period of time for bringing suit on claim rejected by administrator had expired, presentment to county court and its subsequent rejection did not operate to fix new period of time within which an action on the claim could be instituted.

        Editorial Board Comment
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As recommended for amendment in 1989 by the Joint Editorial Board, the section directs the personal representative to pay allowed claims at the earlier of one year from death or the expiration of 4 months from first publication [North Dakota provisions vary from UPC here]. This interpretation reflects that distribution need not be delayed further on account of creditors’ claims once a time bar running from death or publication has run, for known creditors who have failed to present claims by such time may have received an actual notice leading to a bar 60 days thereafter and in any event can and should be the occasion for withholding or the making of other provision by the personal representative to cover the possibility of later presentation and allowance of such claims. Distribution would also be appropriate whenever competent and solvent distributees expressly agree to indemnify the estate for any claims remaining unbarred and undischarged after the distribution.

      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of statute an executor, administrator, or a trustee is personally liable on contracts entered into in his fiduciary capacity unless he expressly excludes personal liability in the contract. He is commonly personally liable for obligations stemming from ownership or possession of the property (e.g., taxes) and for torts committed by servants employed in the management of the property. The claimant ordinarily can reach the estate only after exhausting his remedies against the fiduciary as an individual and then only to the extent that the fiduciary is entitled to indemnity from the property. This and the following sections are designed to make the estate a quasi-corporation for purposes of such liabilities. The personal representative would be personally liable only if an agent for a corporation would be under the same circumstances, and the claimant has a direct remedy against the quasi-corporate property.

       A “contingent claim”, within former statute barring claims against an estate arising on contract, even though contingent, unless presented within the time limited in the notice, was one in which liability depended upon the occurrence of a future event which made it uncertain whether the claim would become a liability. Graber v. Bontrager, 69 N.D. 300, 285 N.W. 865, 1939 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 1939).

     <p>
      In allowing a claim the personal representative may deduct any counterclaim which the estate has against the claimant. In determining a claim against an estate, a court shall reduce the amount allowed by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims exceed the claim, render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess. A counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction other than that upon which the claim is based. A counterclaim may give rise to relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the claim.

       Section 30.1-09-09 establishes a rule of construction against exoneration. Thus, unless the will indicates to the contrary, a specific devisee of mortgaged property takes subject to the lien without right to have other assets applied to discharge the secured obligation.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended substitution of the word “presented”, in the first sentence, for the word “filed” in the original text. The change aligns this section with Section 3-804 [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-19-04], which describes several methods, including mailing or delivery to the personal representative, as methods of protecting a claim against non-claim provisions of the Code.

       Under subdivision a of subsection 1 of section 30.1-19-03, if a local (property only) administration is commenced and proceeds to advertisement for claims before nonclaim statutes have run at domicile, claimants may prove claims in the local administration at any time before the local nonclaim period expires. Section 30.1-19-15 has the effect of subjecting all assets of the decedent, wherever they may be located and administered, to claims properly presented in any local administration. It is necessary, however, that the personal representative of any portion of the estate be aware of other administrations in order for him to become responsible for claims and charges established against other administrations.

Persons entitled to property by homestead allowance, exemption, or intestacy may establish title thereto by proof of the decedent’s ownership, the decedent’s death, and their relationship to the decedent. Successors take subject to all charges incident to administration, including the claims of creditors and allowances of surviving spouse and dependent children, and subject to the rights of others resulting from abatement, retainer, advancement, and ademption.

      <p>
       A testator may determine the order in which the assets of his estate are applied to the payment of his debts. If he does not, then the provisions of this section express rules which may be regarded as approximating what testators generally want. The statutory order of abatement is designed to aid in resolving doubts concerning the intention of a particular testator, rather than to defeat his purpose. Hence, subsection 2 directs that consideration be given to the purpose of a testator. This may be revealed in many ways. Thus, it is commonly held that, even in the absence of statute, general legacies to a wife, or to persons with respect to which the testator is in loco parentis, are to be preferred to other legacies in the same class because this accords with the probable purpose of the legacies.

      <p>
       Unlike the common law, this section provides that a general pecuniary devisee’s right to interest begins one year from the time when administration was commenced, rather than one year from death. The rule provided here is similar to the common-law rule in that the right to interest for delayed payment does not depend on whether the estate in fact realized income during the period of delay. The section is consistent with section 5(b) of the Revised Uniform Principal and Income Act which allocates realized net income of an estate between various categories of successors.

       This section establishes a preference for distribution in kind. It directs a personal representative to make distribution in kind whenever feasible and to convert assets to cash only where there is a special reason for doing so. It provides a reasonable means for determining value of assets distributed in kind. It is implicit in sections 30.1-12-01, 30.1-20-01, and this section that each residuary beneficiary’s basic right is to his proportionate share of each asset constituting the residue.

       This and sections following should be read with section 30.1-18-09 which permits the personal representative to leave certain assets of a decedent’s estate in the possession of the person presumptively entitled thereto. The “release” contemplated by this section would be used as evidence that the personal representative had determined that he would not need to disturb the possession of an heir or devisee for purposes of administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under section 30.1-18-11, a personal representative’s relationship to assets of the estate is described as the “same power over the title to property of the estate as an absolute owner would have”. A personal representative may, however, acquire a full title to estate assets, as in the case where particular items are conveyed to the personal representative by sellers, transfer agents, or others. The language of section 30.1-20-07 is designed to cover instances where the instrument of distribution operates as a transfer, as well as those in which its operation is more like a release.

       The term “improperly” as used in this section must be read in light of section 30.1-18-03 and the manifest purpose of this and other sections of the Code to shift questions concerning the propriety of various distributions from the fiduciary to the distributees in order to prevent every administration from becoming an adjudicated matter. Thus, a distribution may be “authorized at the time” as contemplated by section 30.1-18-03, and still be “improper” under this section. Section 30.1-18-03 is designed to permit a personal representative to distribute without risk in some cases, even though there has been no adjudication. When an unadjudicated distribution has occurred, the rights of persons to show that the basis for the distribution (e.g., an informally probated will, or informally issued letters of administration) is incorrect, or that the basis was improperly applied (erroneous interpretation, for example) is preserved against distributees by this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of “distributee” to include the trustee and beneficiary of a testamentary trust in subsection 11 of section 30.1-01-06 is important in allocating liabilities that may arise under sections 30.1-20-09 and 30.1-20-10 on improper distribution by the personal representative under an informally probated will. The provisions of 30.1-20-09 and 30.1-20-10 are based on the theory that liability follows the property and the fiduciary is absolved from liability by reliance upon the informally probated will.

      If property distributed in kind or a security interest therein is acquired for value by a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who has received an instrument or deed of distribution from the personal representative, or is so acquired by a purchaser from or lender to a transferee of the distributee, the purchaser or lender takes title free of any right of an interested person in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, or to any interested person, whether or not the distribution was proper or supported by court order or the authority of the personal representative was terminated before execution of the instrument or deed. This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who, as personal representative, has executed a deed of distribution to the personal representative, and a purchaser from or lender to any other distributee or the distributee’s transferee. To be protected under this provision, a purchaser or lender need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated before the distribution.

       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended additions that strengthen the protection extended by this section to bona fide purchasers from distributees. The additional language was derived from recommendations evolved with respect to the Colorado version of the Code by probate and title authorities who agreed on language to relieve title assurers of doubts they had identified in relation to some cases.

    Private agreements among successors to decedent binding on personal representative.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Subject to the rights of creditors and taxing authorities, competent successors may agree among themselves to alter the interests, shares, or amounts to which they are entitled under the will of the decedent, or under the laws of intestacy, in any way that they provide in a written contract executed by all who are affected by its provisions. The personal representative shall abide by the terms of the agreement subject to the personal representative’s obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all taxes and costs of administration, and to carry out the responsibilities of the personal representative’s office for the benefit of any successors of the decedent who are not parties. Personal representatives of decedents’ estates are not required to see to the performance of trusts if the trustee thereof is another person who is willing to accept the trust. Accordingly, trustees of a testamentary trust are successors for the purposes of this section. Nothing herein relieves trustees of any duties owed to beneficiaries of trusts.

      <p>
       It may be asserted that this section is only a restatement of the obvious and should be omitted. Its purpose, however, is to make it clear that the successors to an estate have residual control over the way it is to be distributed. Hence, they may compel a personal representative to administer and distribute as they may agree and direct. Successors should compare the consequences and possible advantages of careful use of the power to renounce as described by section 30.1-10-01 (see now chapter 30.1-10.1) with the effect of agreement under this section. The most obvious difference is that an agreement among successors under this section would involve transfers by some participants to the extent it changed the pattern of distribution from that otherwise applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Differing from a pattern that is familiar in many states, this Code does not subject testamentary trusts and trustees to special statutory provisions, or supervisory jurisdiction. A testamentary trustee is treated as a devisee with special duties which are of no particular concern to the personal representative. Article VII contains optional procedures extending the safeguards available to personal representatives to trustees of both inter vivos and testamentary trusts.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is concerned with the fiduciary responsibility of the executor to beneficiaries of trusts to which he may deliver. Normally, the trustee represents beneficiaries in matters involving third persons, including prior fiduciaries. Yet, the executor may apprehend that delivery to the trustee may involve risks for the safety of the fund and for him. For example, he may be anxious to see that there is no equivocation about the devisee’s willingness to accept the trust, and no problem of preserving evidence of the acceptance. He may have doubts about the integrity of the trustee, or about his ability to function satisfactorily. The testator’s selection of the trustee may have been based on facts which are still current, or which are of doubtful relevance at the time of distribution. If the risks relate to the question of the trustee’s intention to handle the fund without profit for himself, a conflict of interest problem is involved. If the risk relates to the ability of the trustee to manage prudently, a more troublesome question is posed for the executor. Is he, as executor, not bound to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries?
      </p>
      <p>
       In many instances involving doubts of this sort, the executor probably will want the protection of a court order. Sections 30.1-21-01 and 30.1-21-02 provide ample authority for an appropriate proceeding in the court which issued the executor’s letters.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other cases, however, the executor may believe that he may be adequately protected if the acceptance of the trust by the devisee is unequivocal, or if the trustee is bonded. The purpose of this section is to make it clear that it is proper for the executor to require the trustee to register the trust and to notify beneficiaries before receiving distribution. Also, the section complements section 30.1-34-04 by providing that the personal representative may petition an appropriate court to require that the trustee be bonded.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Status of testamentary trustees under the Uniform Probate Code.
       </b>
       Under the Uniform Probate Code, the testamentary trustee by construction would be considered a devisee, distributee, and successor to whom title passes at time of the testator’s death even though the will must be probated to prove the transfer. The informally probated will is conclusive until set aside and the personal representative may distribute to the trustee under the informally probated will or settlement agreement and the title of the trustee as distributee represented by the instrument or deed of distribution is conclusive until set aside on showing that it is improper. Should the informally probated will be set aside or the distribution to the trustee be shown to be improper, the trustee as distributee would be liable for value received but purchasers for value from the trustee as distributee under an instrument of distribution would be protected. Section 30.1-01-06’s definition of “distributee” limits the distributee liability of the trustee and substitutes that of the trust beneficiaries to the extent of distributions by the trustee.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a distributee as defined by section 30.1-01-06, the testamentary trustee or beneficiary of a testamentary trust is liable to claimants like other distributees, would have the right of contribution from other distributees of the decedent’s estate and would be protected by the same time limitations as other distributees (section 30.1-21-06).
      </p>
      <p>
       Incident to his standing as a distributee of the decedent’s estate, the testamentary trustee would be an interested party who could petition for an order of complete settlement by the personal representative or for an order terminating testate administration. He also could appropriately receive the personal representative’s account and distribution under a closing statement. As distributee he could represent his beneficiaries in compromise settlements in the decedent’s estate which would be binding upon him and his beneficiaries. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-20s30.1-20-12" target="_self">30.1-20-12</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general fiduciary responsibilities of the testamentary trustee are not altered by the Uniform Probate Code and the trustee continues to have the duty to collect and reduce to possession within a reasonable time the assets of the trust estate including the enforcement of any claims on behalf of the trust against prior fiduciaries, including the personal representative, and third parties.

      <p>
       This section copies the Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act. [The original comment has been retained here. Under the current Uniform Probate Code, former 3-916 is now a reserved section. Apportionment of Estate Taxes is now covered in a new Part 9A of Article IIII, which has not been adopted by North Dakota. For informational purposes, the General Comment to Part 9A of the Uniform Probate Code follows.]

       <b>
        General Comment to Part 9A of UPC.
       </b>
       Part 9A incorporates into the Uniform Probate Code the Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act as revised in 2003 (UETAA or new UETAA). The new UETAA replaces the Code’s former estate tax apportionment provision (Section 3- 916), which incorporated into the Code the former UETAA.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) places the primary responsibility for paying federal estate taxes on the decedent’s executor and empowers, but does not direct, the executor to collect from recipients of certain nonprobate transfers included in the taxable estate a prorated portion of the estate tax attributable to those types of property. In the absence of specific contrary directions of the decedent, the IRC generally provides as to other transfers that taxes are to be borne by the persons who would bear that cost if the taxes were paid by the executor prior to distributing the estate. The determination of who should bear the ultimate burden of the estate taxes is left to state law.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a state does not have a statutory apportionment law, the burden of the estate taxes generally will fall on residuary beneficiaries of the probate estate. This means that recipients of many types of nonprobate assets (such as beneficiaries of revocable trusts and surviving joint tenants) may be exonerated from paying a portion of the tax. Also, it generates a risk that residual gifts to the spouse or a charity may result in a smaller deduction and a larger tax. A number of states have adopted legislation apportioning the burden of estate taxes among the beneficiaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new UETAA replaces the former UETAA, which was promulgated in 1958 and revised in 1964 and 1982.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new UETAA continues to advance the principle of the former UETAA that the decedent’s expressed intentions govern apportionment of an estate tax. Statutory apportionment applies only to the extent there is no clear and effective decedent’s tax burden direction to the contrary. Under the statutory scheme, marital and charitable beneficiaries generally are insulated from bearing any of the estate tax, and a decedent’s direction that estate tax be paid from a gift to be shared by a spouse or charity with another is construed to locate the tax burden only on the taxable portion of the gift. The new UETAA provides relief for persons forced to pay estate tax on values passing to others whose interests, though contributing to the tax, are unreachable by the fiduciary. The new UETAA also addresses the allocation of the burden incurred because of several federal transfer tax provisions that did not exist when the former UETAA was adopted.

        District court did not err in apportioning the estate tax obligation in accordance with subsection (2) because a testator's boilerplate will provision directing payment of “federal and state taxes” from estate assets did not clearly and unambiguously direct a method of apportionment of estate taxes different from the method provided by statute.

        The federal estate taxes will be paid according to the apportionment method of this section unless the decedent’s will directs in clear and unambiguous language a different method of apportionment.

        Will provision directing the sale of decedent’s business properties and providing that “all of my debts, taxes, etc.; be paid in full, from revenue from such sale” did not clearly and unambiguously direct a method of apportionment of estate taxes different from the method provided by this section as the phrase “all of my … taxes” might refer to just personal or business taxes; there was no express reference in the will to estate taxes; and there was no express direction in the will against the apportionment of estate taxes.

        This section did not apply where will clearly and unambiguously expressed testator’s intent that estate taxes were to be paid in a manner different from that provided by this section. McGuire v. Gaffney, 314 N.W.2d 851, 1982 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 235</cite> (N.D. 1982).

       <p>
        Group gift of what testator’s probate estate could claim as exempt under the unified credit in the Internal Revenue Code, § 2010, and deductible residual gifts to charities were designed to save federal estate taxes by combining exemptions and deductions in federal estate tax law, and testator’s intent to pay necessary estate taxes was not inconsistent with an intent to minimize estate taxes.

In the absence of objection by an omitted or unnotified person, evidence received in the original testacy proceeding shall constitute prima facie proof of due execution of any will previously admitted to probate, or of the fact that the decedent left no valid will if the prior proceedings determined this fact.

       Subsection 2 is derived from § 64(b) of the Illinois Probate Act (1967) (S.H.A. ch. 3, § 64(b). Section 30.1-12-06 specifies that an order is binding as to all who are given notice even though less than all interested persons were notified. This section provides a method of curing an oversight in regard to notice which may come to light before the estate is finally settled. If the person who failed to receive notice of the earlier proceeding succeeds in obtaining entry of a different order from that previously made, others who received notice of the earlier proceeding may be benefitted. Still, they are not entitled to notice of the curative proceeding, nor should they be permitted to appear.

     <p>
      A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition for an order of settlement of the estate which will not adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent. The personal representative may petition at any time, and a devisee may petition after one year, from the appointment of the original personal representative, except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims which arose prior to the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe the will and adjudicate final settlement and distribution of the estate. After notice to all devisees and the personal representative and hearing, the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate under the will, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing or approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any devisee who is a party to the proceeding and those the devisee represents.

       This section permits a final determination of the rights between each other and against the personal representative of the devisees under a will when there has been no formal proceeding in regard to testacy. Hence, the heirs in intestacy need not be made parties. Section 30.1-21-01 permits a final determination of the rights between each other and against the personal representative of all persons interested in an estate. If supervised administration is used, section 30.1-16-05 directs that the estate be closed by use of procedures like those described in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-01" target="_self">30.1-21-01</a></cite>.

       The Code uses “termination” to refer to events which end a personal representative’s authority. See sections 30.1-17-08 et seq. The word “closing” refers to circumstances which support the conclusions that the affairs of the estate either are, or have been alleged to have been, wound up. If the affairs of the personal representative are reviewed and adjudicated under either sections 30.1-21-01 or 30.1-21-02, the judicial conclusion that the estate is wound up serves also to terminate the personal representative’s authority. See section 30.1-17-10, subsection 2. On the other hand, a “closing” statement under section 30.1-21-03 is only an affirmation by the personal representative that he believes the affairs of the estate to be completed. The statement is significant because it reflects that assets have been distributed. Any creditor whose claim has not been barred and who has not been paid is permitted by section 30.1-21-04 to assert his claim against distributees. The personal representative is also still fully subject to suit under sections 30.1-17-02 and 30.1-17-08, for his authority is not “terminated” under section 30.1-17-10, subsection 1, until one year after a closing statement is filed. Even if his authority is “terminated”, he remains liable to suit unless protected by limitation or unless an adjudication settling his accounts is the reason for “termination”. See sections 30.1-21-05 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-08" target="_self">30.1-17-08</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       From a slightly different viewpoint, a personal representative may obtain a complete discharge of his fiduciary obligations through a judicial proceeding after notice. Sections 30.1-21-01 and 30.1-21-02 describe two proceedings which enable a personal representative to gain protection from all persons or from devisees only. A personal representative who neither obtains a judicial order of protection nor files a closing statement is protected by section 30.1-18-03 in regard to acts or distributions which were authorized when done but which become doubtful thereafter because of a change in testacy status. On the other questions, the personal representative who does not take any of the steps described by the Code to gain more protection has no protection against later claims of breach of his fiduciary obligation other than any arising from consent or waiver of individual distributees who may have bound themselves by receipts given to the personal representative.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section increases the prospects of full discharge of a personal representative who uses the closing statement route over those of a personal representative who relies on receipts. Full protection follows from the running of the six month’s limitations period described in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-05" target="_self">30.1-21-05</a></cite>. But, its protection does not prevent distributees from claiming lack of full disclosure. Hence, it offers little more protection than a receipt. Still, it may be useful to decrease the likelihood of later claim of nondisclosure. Its more significant function, however, is to provide a means for terminating the office of personal representative in a way that will be obvious to third persons.

       Personal representative was properly held in contempt because he failed to make a court-ordered payment; the estate was not closed when the personal representative filed a verified statement to attempt to effectively amend a final accounting and distribution. An assertion that the estate was unable to make the payment was barred by the law of the case doctrine, res judicata, and collateral estoppel due to a prior decision in the case. Cashmore v.

      After assets of an estate have been distributed and subject to section 30.1-21-06, an undischarged claim, not barred, may be prosecuted in a proceeding against one or more distributees. No distributee shall be liable to claimants for amounts received as exempt property, homestead or family allowances, or for amounts in excess of the value of the distributee’s distribution as of the time of distribution. As between distributees, each shall bear the cost of satisfaction of unbarred claims as if the claim had been satisfied in the course of administration. Any distributee who has failed to notify other distributees of the demand made upon the distributee by the claimant in sufficient time to permit them to join in any proceeding in which the claim was asserted against the distributee loses the distributee’s right of contribution against other distributees.

      <p>
       This section creates a ceiling on the liability of a distributee of “the value of his distribution” as of the time of distribution. The section indicates that each distributee is liable for all that a claimant may prove to be due, provided the claim does not exceed the value of the defendant’s distribution from the estate. But, each distributee may preserve a right of contribution against other distributees. The risk of insolvency of one or more, but less than all distributees is on the distributee rather than on the claimant.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended the addition, after “claimants for amounts” in the second sentence, of “received as exempt property, homestead or family allowances, or for amounts . . .” The purpose of the addition was to prevent unpaid creditors of a decedent from attempting to enforce their claims against a spouse or child who had received a distribution of exempt values.

       This and the preceding section make it clear that a claimant whose claim has not been barred may have alternative remedies when an estate has been distributed subject to his claim. Under this section, he has six months to prosecute an action against the personal representative if the latter breached any duty to the claimant. For example, the personal representative may be liable to a creditor if he violated the provisions of section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-07" target="_self">30.1-19-07</a></cite>. The preceding section describes the fundamental liability of the distributees to unbarred claimants to the extent of the value received. The last sentence emphasizes that a personal representative who fails to disclose matters relevant to his liability in his closing statement and in the account of administration he furnished to distributees gains no protection from the period described here. A personal representative may, however, use section 30.1-21-01, or, where appropriate, section 30.1-21-02 to secure greater protection.

       This section describes an ultimate time limit for recovery by creditors, heirs, and devisees of a decedent from distributees. It is to be noted: 1. Section 30.1-12-08 imposes a general limit of three years from death on one who must set aside an informal probate in order to establish his rights, or who must secure probate of a late-discovered will after an estate has been administered as intestate. Hence the time limit of section 30.1-12-08 may bar one who would claim as an heir or devisee sooner than this section, although it would never cause a bar prior to three years from the decedent’s death. 2. This section would not bar recovery by a supposed decedent whose estate has been probated. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-15s30.1-15-12" target="_self">30.1-15-12</a></cite>. 3. The limitation of this section ends the possibility of appointment of a personal representative to correct an erroneous distribution as mentioned in sections 30.1-21-05 and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-21s30.1-21-08" target="_self">30.1-21-08</a></cite>. If there have been no adjudications under section 30.1-15-09, or possibly sections 30.1-21-01 or 30.1-21-02, estate of the decedent which is discovered after administration has been closed may be the subject of different distribution than that attending the estate originally administered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last sentence excepting actions or suits to recover property kept from one by the fraud of another may be unnecessary in view of the blanket provision concerning fraud in Article I. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-01s30.1-01-03" target="_self">30.1-01-03</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1989, the Joint Editorial Board recommended changing the section so as to separate proceedings involving claims by claimants barred one year after decedent’s death by Section 3-803(a)(1), and other proceedings by unbarred claimants or by omitted heirs or devisees. [This change was not adopted by North Dakota.]

      A compromise of any controversy as to admission to probate of any instrument offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction, validity, or effect of any governing instrument, the rights or interests in the estate of the decedent, of any successor, or the administration of the estate, if approved in a formal proceeding in the court for that purpose, is binding on all the parties thereto, including those unborn, unascertained, or who could not be located. An approved compromise is binding even though it may affect a trust or an inalienable interest. A compromise does not impair the rights of creditors or of taxing authorities who are not parties to it.

        Procedures in N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-22-01 and 30.1-22-02 authorize a court to consider an agreement settling litigation challenging a settlor's capacity to create a trust. Therefore, a district court did not err by accepting a settlement agreement and dismissing a petition challenging the capacity to create a trust due to the settlor's alcoholism. Brakke v.

        In a trust dispute, a petition was a good faith challenge to the capacity to create a trust where the settlor was affected by alcoholism, and it was necessary to avoid further litigation and protect the interests of the beneficiaries. Moreover, a life estate holder did not have to sign the agreement because the settlement agreement pertained to distributions to residuary beneficiaries after the expiration of the life estate.

      <p>
       This section and the one preceding it outline a procedure which may be initiated by competent parties having beneficial interests in a decedent’s estate as a means of resolving controversy concerning the estate. If all competent persons with beneficial interests or claims which might be affected by the proposal and parents properly representing interests of their children concur, a settlement scheme differing from that otherwise governing the devolution may be substituted. The procedure for securing representation of minors and unknown or missing persons with interests must be followed. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Ic30.1-03s30.1-03-03" target="_self">30.1-03-03</a></cite>. The ultimate control of the question of whether the substitute proposal shall be accepted is with the court which must find:
      </p>
      <p>
       “that the contest or controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the agreement upon the interests of parties represented by fiduciaries is just and reasonable”.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thrust of the procedure is to put the authority for initiating settlement proposals with the persons who have beneficial interests in the estate, and to prevent executors and testamentary trustees from vetoing any such proposal. The only reason for approving a scheme of devolution which differs from that framed by the testator or the statutes governing intestacy is to prevent dissipation of the estate in wasteful litigation. Because executors and trustees may have an interest in fees and commissions which they might earn through efforts to carry out testator’s intention, the judgment of the court is substituted for that of such fiduciaries in appropriate cases. A controversy which the court may find to be in good faith, as well as concurrence of all beneficially interested and competent persons and parent-representatives provide prerequisites which should prevent the procedure from being abused. Thus, the procedure does not threaten the planning of a testator who plans and drafts with sufficient clarity and completeness to eliminate the possibility of good faith controversy concerning the meaning and legality of his plan.

      General Editorial Board Comment.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The four sections which follow include two designed to facilitate transfer of small estates without use of a personal representative, and two designed to simplify the duties of a personal representative, who is appointed to handle a small estate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Flexible System of Administration described by earlier portions of Article III lends itself well to situations involving small estates. Letters may be obtained quickly without notice or judicial involvement. Immediately, the personal representative is in a position to distribute to successors whose deeds or transfers will protect purchasers. This route accommodates the need for quick and inexpensive transfers of land of small value as well as other assets. Consequently, it was unnecessary to frame complex provisions extending the affidavit procedures to land.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, transfers via letters of administration may prove to be less troublesome than use of the affidavit procedure. Still, it seemed desirable to provide a quick collection mechanism which avoids all necessity to visit the probate court. For one thing, unpredictable local variations in probate practice may produce situations where the alternative procedure will be very useful. For another, the provision of alternatives is in line with the overall philosophy of Article III to provide maximum flexibility.

     Figures gleaned from a recent authoritative report of a major survey of probated estates in Cleveland, Ohio, demonstrate that more than one-half of all estates in probate had a gross value of less than $15,000. This means that the principal measure of the relevance of any legislation dealing with probate procedures is to be found in its impact on very small and moderate sized estates. Here is the area where probate affects most people.

       This section provides for an easy method for collecting the personal property of a decedent by affidavit prior to any formal disposition. Existing legislation generally permits the surviving widow or children to collect wages and other small amounts of liquid funds. This section goes further in that it allows the collection of personal property as well as money and permits any devisee or heir to make the collection. Since the appointment of a personal representative may be obtained easily under the Code, it is unnecessary to make the provisions regarding small estates applicable to realty.

       This section makes it possible for the personal representative to make a summary distribution of a small estate without the necessity of giving notice to creditors. Since the probate estate of many decedents will not exceed the amount specified in the statute, this section will prove useful in many estates.

      General Editorial Board Comment.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     This Article concerns the law applicable in estate problems which involve more than a single state. It covers the powers and responsibilities in the adopting state of personal representatives appointed in other states.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some provisions of the Code covering local appointment of personal representatives for non-residents appear in Article III. These include the following: 30.1-13-01 (venue), 30.1-13-02 (resolution of conflicting claims regarding domicile), 30.1-13-03 (priority as personal representative of representative previously appointed at domicile), 30.1-14-07, subsection 1 (thirty days’ delay required before appointment of a local representative for a nonresident), 30.1-19-03, subsection 1 (claims barred by non-claim at domicile before local administration commenced are barred locally), and 30.1-19-15 (duty of personal representative in regard to claims where estate is being administered in more than one state). See also sections 30.1-14-08, 30.1-17-11, 30.1-19-16, and <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIVc30.1-24s30.1-24-08" target="_self">30.1-24-08</a></cite>.
    </p>
    <p>
     The recognition provisions contained in Article IV and the various provisions of Article III which relate to administration of estates of nonresidents are designed to coerce respect for domiciliary procedures and administrative acts to the extent possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first part of Article IV [section 30.1-24-01] contains some definitions of particular relevance to estates located in two or more states.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second part of Article IV [sections 30.1-24-02 through 30.1-24-08] deals with the powers of foreign personal representatives in a jurisdiction adopting the Uniform Probate Code. There are different types of power which may be exercised. First, a foreign personal representative has the power under section 30.1-24-02 to receive payments of debts owed to the decedent or to accept delivery of property belonging to the decedent. The foreign personal representative provides an affidavit indicating the date of death of the nonresident decedent, that no local administration has been commenced, and that the foreign personal representative is entitled to payment or delivery. Payment under this provision can be made any time more than sixty days after the death of the decedent. When made in good faith, the payment operates as a discharge of the debtor. A protection for local creditors of the decedent is provided in section 30.1-24-04, under which local debtors of the nonresident decedent can be notified of the claims which local creditors have against the estate. This notification will prevent payment under this provision.
    </p>
    <p>
     A second type of power is provided in sections 30.1-24-05 to 30.1-24-07, inclusive. Under these provisions a foreign personal representative can file with the appropriate court a copy of his appointment and official bond if he has one. Upon so filing, the foreign personal representative has all of the powers of a personal representative appointed by the local court. This would be all of the powers provided for in an unsupervised administration as provided in Article III of the Code.
    </p>
    <p>
     The third type of power which may be obtained by a foreign personal representative is conferred by the priority the domiciliary personal representative enjoys in respect to local appointment. This is covered by section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-13s30.1-13-03" target="_self">30.1-13-03</a></cite>. Also, see section 30.1-17-11, subs. 2.
    </p>
    <p>
     The third part of this Article [sections 30.1-25-01 to 30.1-25-03, inclusive] provides for power in the local court over foreign personal representatives who act locally. If a local or ancillary administration has been started, provisions in Article III subject the appointee to the power of the court. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-02" target="_self">30.1-17-02</a></cite>. In the third part of this Article, it is provided that a foreign personal representative submits himself to the jurisdiction of the local court by filing a copy of his appointment to get the powers provided in section 30.1-24-06 or by doing any act which would give the state jurisdiction over him as an individual. In addition, the collection of funds as provided in section 30.1-25-01 gives the court quasi-in-rem jurisdiction over the foreign personal representative to the extent of the funds collected.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, section 30.1-25-02 provides that the foreign personal representative is subject to the jurisdiction of the local court “to the same extent that his decedent was subject to jurisdiction immediately prior to death”. This is similar to the typical nonresident motorist provision that provides for jurisdiction over the personal representative of a deceased nonresident motorist, see Note, 44 Iowa L. Rev. 384 (1959). It is, however, a much broader provision. Section 30.1-25-03 provides for the mechanical steps to be taken in serving the foreign personal representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part 4 [section 30.1-25-04] of the Article deals with the res judicata effect to be given adjudications for or against a foreign personal representative. Any such adjudication is to be conclusive on a local personal representative “unless it resulted from fraud or collusion .
   .
   . to the prejudice of the estate”. This provision must be read with section 30.1-15-08 which deals with certain out-of-state findings concerning a decedent’s estate.

      The power of a domiciliary foreign personal representative under section 30.1-24-02 or 30.1-24-06 shall be exercised only if there is no administration or application therefor pending in this state. An application or petition for local administration of the estate terminates the power of the foreign personal representative to act under section 30.1-24-06, but the local court may allow the foreign personal representative to exercise limited powers to preserve the estate. No person who, before receiving actual notice of a pending local administration, has changed that person’s position in reliance upon the powers of a foreign personal representative shall be prejudiced by reason of the application or petition for, or grant of, local administration. The local personal representative is subject to all duties and obligations which have accrued by virtue of the exercise of the powers by the foreign personal representative and may be substituted for the foreign personal representative in any action or proceedings in this state.

       The words “courts of this state” are sufficient under federal legislation to include a federal court having jurisdiction in the adopting state.
      </p>
      <p>
       A foreign personal representative appointed at the decedent’s domicile has priority for appointment in any local administration proceeding. See section 30.1-13-03, subs. 7. Once appointed, a local personal representative remains subject to the jurisdiction of the appointing court under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-17s30.1-17-02" target="_self">30.1-17-02</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1975, the Joint Editorial Board recommended substitution of the word “personally” for “himself”, in the preliminary language of the first sentence. Also, language restricting the submission to jurisdiction to cases involving the estate was added in 1975.

     [Parts I through IV of Article V (N.D.C.C. chs. 30.1-26 through 30.1-29) of the UPC were replaced in 1982 by the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act, which was also a free-standing act. The 1982 Act was replaced by the 1997 Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act, which currently comprises Parts I through IV of Article V of the UPC. North Dakota has not adopted either the 1982 or 1997 version of the Uniform Guardianship and Protective Proceedings Act. The uniform code section numbers following the North Dakota code section designations have not been changed from the original numbering prior to the 1982 revision of Article V of the UPC and the original commentary has been retained where it remains applicable.]
    </p>
    <p>
     Article V, entitled “Protection of Persons under Disability and Their Property” embodies separate systems of guardianship to protect persons of minors and mental incompetents. It also includes provisions for a type of power of attorney that does not terminate on disability of the principal which may be used by adults approaching senility or incompetence to avoid the necessity for other kinds of protective regimes. Finally, chapter 30.1-29 of the Article offers a system of protective proceedings, including conservatorships, to provide for the management of substantial aggregations of property of persons who are, for one reason or another, including minority and mental incompetence, unable to manage their own property.
    </p>
    <p>
     It should be emphasized that the Article contains many provisions designed to minimize or avoid the necessity of guardianship and protective proceedings, as well as provisions designed to simplify and minimize arrangements which become necessary for care of persons or their property. The power of attorney which confers authority notwithstanding later incompetence is one example of the former. Another is a facility of payment provision which permits relatively small sums owed to a minor to be paid whether or not there is a guardian or other official who has been designated to act for the minor. A new device tending to simplify necessary protective proceedings is found in provisions in chapter 30.1-29 which permit a judge to make appropriate orders concerning the property of a disabled person without appointing a fiduciary.
    </p>
    <p>
     The highspots of the several parts of Article V, considered in somewhat more detail, include the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li id="t30.1a0Vol11">
      The facility of payment clause, which is section 30.1-26-03, permits one owing up to $5,000 per year to a minor to be validly discharged by payment to the minor, if he is married, to the minor’s parent or grandparent or other adult with whom the minor resides, to a guardian, or by deposit in an account in the name of the minor.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1a0Vol12">
      A provision in chapter 30.1-27 permits the surviving parent of a minor to designate a guardian by will. A similar provision in chapter 30.1-28 authorizes a parent or spouse to designate a guardian for an incapacitated person by will. Such designation becomes effective upon probate of the will and the filing of an acceptance by the guardian. Thereafter the status of guardian and ward arises. It is like guardianship of the person, rather than of estate. It is described as a parental relationship without the parental obligation of support. The relationship follows the guardian and ward and is properly recognized and implemented, as and when necessary, by the courts of any jurisdiction where these persons may be located. No requirement of periodic reports or accounts is imposed on a testamentary guardian. The question of his proper expenditure of the small sums which he may receive for the ward is left to be settled by the guardian and ward after the ward attains full age. If the amounts involved become more than the guardian cares to be responsible for on this basis, he or any other interested person may seek the appointment of a property manager who is called a “conservator” by the Code. The guardian may be eligible to be appointed to this position.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1a0Vol13">
      A parent or guardian is permitted to delegate his authority for short periods as necessitated by anticipated absence or incapacity.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1a0Vol14">
      As previously mentioned, chapter 30.1-29 deals with protective proceedings designed to permit substantial property interests of minors and others unable properly to manage their own affairs to be controlled by court order or managed by a conservator appointed by the court. The causes for inability of owner-management that are listed by the statute are quite broad. Technical incompetency is but one of several reasons why one may be unable to manage his affairs. See section 30.1-29-01, subs. 2. The draftsmen’s view was that reliance should be placed on the fact that the court applying the statute would be a full power court and on the various procedural safeguards, including a right to jury trial, to protect against unwise use of the proceedings, rather than to attempt to state and rely upon a narrow or technical test of lack of ability.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1a0Vol15">
      If a conservator is appointed, provisions in chapter 30.1-29 of the draft give him broad powers of management that may be exercised without a court order. On the other hand, provision is made for restricting the managerial or distribution powers of a conservator, provided notation of the restriction appears on his letters of appointment. Unless restricted, the fiduciary may be able to distribute and end the arrangement without court order if he can meet the terms of the Act. Among other kinds of expenditures and disbursements authorized, payments for the support and education of the protected person as determined by a guardian of the protected person, if any, or by the conservator, if there is no guardian, are approved. Also, certain payments for the support of dependents of the protected person are approved by the Code and hence would require no special approval.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1a0Vol16">
      Other provisions in chapter 30.1-29 round out the relationship of protective proceedings to creditors of the protected person and persons who deal with a conservator. Claims are handled by the conservator who is given a fiduciary responsibility to claimants and suitable discretion concerning allowance. If questions arise, the appointing court has all needed power to deal with disputes with creditors. The draft changes the common law rule that contracts of a guardian are his personal responsibility. A conservator is not liable personally on contracts made for the estate unless he agrees to such liability. A section buttresses the managerial powers given to conservator by protecting all persons who deal with them.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1a0Vol17">
      Another section seeks to reduce the importance of state lines in respect to the authority of conservators by permitting appointees of foreign courts to act locally. Also, it follows the pattern of Article III dealing with ancillary administration of decedents’ estates by giving the conservator appointed at the domicile of the protected person priority for appointment locally in case local administration of a protected person’s assets becomes necessary.
     </li>
     <li id="t30.1a0Vol18">
      The many states which have adopted the Uniform Veterans Guardianship Act now have two systems for protection of the property of minors and mental incompetents, one of which applies if the property was derived, in whole or in part, from benefits paid by the Veterans Administration and its minor or incompetent owner is or has been a beneficiary of the Veterans Administration, and the other of which applies to all other property. It is sometimes difficult to ascertain whether a person has ever received a benefit from the Veterans Administration and commonly impossible to determine whether property was derived in part from benefits paid by the Veterans Administration. Chapter 30.1-29 would provide a single system for the protection of property of minors and others unable to manage their own property, thus superseding the Uniform Veterans Guardianship Act. It would preserve the right of the Veterans Administration to appear in protective proceedings involving the property of its beneficiaries and would permit the imposition of the same safeguards provided by the superseded Uniform Veterans Guardianship Act.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-27" target="_self">Chapter 30.1-27</a></cite> also permits a testamentary guardian of a minor to receive and expend sums payable to the minor for the minor’s support and education without court order. He may not pay himself for services, however, and is under a duty to deposit excess funds, or to seek a suitable property-protection order if other management is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Section 30.1-29-09 is important, for it makes it clear that a court entertaining a protective proceeding has full power, through its orders, to do anything the protected person himself might have done if not disabled. Another provision broadens the form of relief so that the court may handle a single transaction, like renewal of a mortgage, or a sale and related investment of proceeds, which is recommended in respect to the affairs of a protected person directly by its orders rather than through the appointment of a conservator.

      Any person under a duty to pay or deliver money or personal property to a minor may perform this duty, in amounts not exceeding five thousand dollars per annum, by paying or delivering the money or property to:

     <p>
      This section does not apply if the person making payment or delivery has actual knowledge that a conservator has been appointed or proceedings for appointment of a conservator of the estate of the minor are pending. The persons, other than the minor or any financial institution under subsection 4, receiving money or property for a minor, are obligated to apply the money to the support and education of the minor, but may not pay themselves except by way of reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses for goods and services necessary for the minor’s support. Any excess sums shall be preserved for future support of the minor and any balance not so used and any property received for the minor must be turned over to the minor when the minor attains majority. Persons who pay or deliver in accordance with provisions of this section are not responsible for the proper application thereof.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] Where a minor has only a small amount of property, it would be wasteful to require protective proceedings to deal with the property. This section makes it possible for other persons, such as the guardian, to handle the less complicated property affairs of the ward. Protective proceedings, including the possible establishment of a conservatorship, will be sought where substantial property is involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not go as far as many facility of payment provisions found in trust instruments which usually permit application of sums due minor beneficiary to any expense or charge for the minor. It was felt that a grant of so large an area of discretion to any category of person who might owe funds to a minor would be unwise. Nonetheless, the section as drafted should reduce the need for trust facility of payment provision somewhat, while extending opportunities to insurance companies and other debtors to minors for relatively simple methods of gaining discharge.

      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] This section permits a temporary delegation of parental powers. For example, parents (or guardian) of a minor plan to be out of the country for several months. They wish to empower a close relative (e.g., an uncle) to take any necessary action regarding the child while they are away. Using this section, they could execute an appropriate power of attorney giving the uncle custody and power to consent. Then if an emergency operation were required, the uncle could consent on behalf of the child; as a practical matter he would of course attempt to communicate with the parents before acting. The section is designed to reduce problems relating to consents for emergency treatment.

    (5-202) Testamentary appointment of guardian of minor.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The parent of a minor may appoint by will a guardian of an unmarried minor. A testamentary appointment becomes effective upon filing the guardian’s acceptance in the court in which the will is probated and remains effective upon approval by the court either after or without a hearing, if, before acceptance, both parents are dead or the surviving parent’s rights have been terminated by prior court order. If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority. This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing the guardian’s acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the testator’s domicile and upon approval by the court either after or without a hearing. Upon acceptance of appointment, written notice of acceptance must be given by the guardian to the minor and to the person having the minor’s care or to the minor’s nearest adult relative under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="gov.nd.code.title.27.html#t27c27-20.1s27-20.3-02" target="_blank">27-20.3-02</a></cite>. Within forty-five days of the filing of acceptance, the testamentary guardian must file with the court a criminal history record check report and affidavit stating whether the proposed guardian has been investigated for offenses related to theft, fraud, or the abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an adult or child and shall provide a release authorizing access to any record information maintained by an agency in this or another state or a federal agency.

      </p>
      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] Rather than provide for priorities among various classes of relatives, it was felt that the only priority should be for the person nominated by the minor. The important point is to locate someone whose appointment will be in the best interests of the minor. If there is contention among relatives over who should be named, it is not likely that a statutory priority keyed to degrees of kinship would help resolve the matter. For example, if the argument involved a squabble between relatives of the child’s father and relatives of its mother, priority in terms of degrees of kinship would be useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guardianships under this Code are not likely to be attractive positions for persons who are more interested in handling a minor’s estate than in his personal well-being. An order of a court having equity power is necessary if the guardian is to receive payment for services where there is no conservator for the minor’s estate. Also, the powers of management of a ward’s estate conferred on a guardian are restricted so that if a substantial estate is involved, a conservator will be needed to handle the financial matters.

        Best Interests of Child.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In awarding the custody of a minor or appointing a general guardian, the court was to be guided by the best interests of the child in respect to its temporal, moral, or mental welfare. Flath v. Nelson, 53 N.D. 603, 207 N.W. 444, 1926 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 13</cite> (N.D. 1926).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the awarding of the custody and the appointing of guardians of children, the determining consideration was the welfare of the child. Rufer v. Rufer, 67 N.D. 67, 269 N.W. 741, 1936 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 152</cite> (N.D. 1936); Sjol v. Sjol, 76 N.D. 336, 35 N.W.2d 797, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       An eleven-year-old daughter was permitted to remain in the home of her maternal grandmother in which she had been cared for from early infancy since the welfare of the child outweighed the legal rights of the father. Borg v. Anderson, 73 N.D. 95, 11 N.W.2d 121, 1943 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 66</cite> (N.D. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       A parent was entitled to the custody of his child unless the evidence showed that the best interests of the child would not be served by awarding him custody. In re Custody of Wagner, 84 N.W.2d 587, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       In habeas corpus proceeding by father to obtain custody of nine-year-old daughter it was determined that the welfare of the child, who had been in the care and custody of the respondents almost since her birth, and treated as their own child, would be best served by permitting her to remain with the respondents. In re Custody of Wagner, 84 N.W.2d 587, 1957 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 138</cite> (N.D. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory right of the parent to primary consideration in the matter of custody was subject to a determination of what was best for the child, such best interests of the child being paramount. McKay v. Mitzel, 137 N.W.2d 792, 1965 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 115</cite> (N.D. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       The best interests of children were served by giving them to persons, who had had custody of children since their parents had been killed in auto accident, operated a 1,185 acre farm, made twelve thousand dollars per year, had four children with outstanding records, took the children to church and Sunday school every Sunday even though they might be more strict than other persons who had first petitioned for the children, who had four children of their own, who lived in trailer which was encumbered, made eight thousand dollars a year, were Lutherans but did not belong to or attend any church, and whose only character witness was owner and operator of a bar. In re Adoption of Godejohn, 190 N.W.2d 42, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 144</cite> (N.D. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory preference set forth in statute on rules for awarding custody was dependent upon a finding that an award of custody to either the mother or the father of a child of tender years would be in the best interests of the child. Ferguson v. Ferguson, 202 N.W.2d 760, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 98</cite> (N.D. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Capacity of Child to Choose.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no exact age which gave child capacity to make choice as to custody within purview of statute on rules for awarding custody; phrase “other things being equal” gave court large measure of discretion to determine how best interests of child would be served and awarding custody of minor child to natural father was not an abuse of discretion under circumstances. Guldeman v. Heller, 151 N.W.2d 436, 1967 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 123</cite> (N.D. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Child of Tender Years.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In custody proceedings neither parent is entitled to custody as of right, but other things being equal, if the child is of tender years, it should be given to the mother. Silseth v. Levang, 214 N.W.2d 361, 1974 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 253</cite> (N.D. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Custody to Mother.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Upon the death of a father to whom was awarded the custody of a child in a divorce suit, the mother could be given custody in a habeas corpus proceeding, upon a showing that she was a proper person. Garrett v. Burbage, 55 N.D. 926, 215 N.W. 479, 1927 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 169</cite> (N.D. 1927).

      <p>
       <b>
        Custody to Third Party.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Custody could be awarded to a third party when the morals or safety or interests of the child demanded it. Sjol v. Sjol, 76 N.D. 336, 35 N.W.2d 797, 1949 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 59</cite> (N.D. 1949).

      <p>
       Mother who admitted committing adultery on one occasion but who was otherwise a good mother was awarded custody of her three and five-year-old daughters. Ficek v. Ficek, 186 N.W.2d 437, 1971 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 173</cite> (N.D. 1971).

       <b>
        Termination of Parental Rights.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a legal order terminating the parental rights of the mother to her illegitimate child was made, and where notice of the proceedings was given in accordance with the requirements of the statute, custody preferences provided by former section 30-10-07 were subordinated to the custody rights provided by the termination order. In re Klundt, 196 N.W.2d 76, 1972 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 171</cite> (N.D. 1972).

        Under North Dakota’s guardianship of minors’
   law, a trial court must determine whether the welfare and best interest of the minor will be served by the appointment of the guardian. Likewise, the termination of a guardianship must be based on the ground that removal will be in the best interest of the minor; the guardianship of minors’
   law applies to both voluntarily established and involuntarily established guardianships, and determining the best interest of the minor does not necessarily require a finding that the parent is unfit.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In the context of a parent’s action to terminate a voluntarily-established guardianship of a minor, a natural parent must initially prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the impediments leading to the creation of the guardianship are removed. A nonparent seeking custody then has the burden of rebutting the presumption that it is in the best interests of the child to be in the custody of the parent; the presumption can be overcome when there exist “exceptional circumstances.”

      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] The “long-arm” principle behind this section is well established. It seems desirable that the court in which acceptance is filed be able to serve its process on the guardian wherever he has moved. The continuing interest of that court in the welfare of the minor is ample to justify this provision. The consent to service is real rather than fictional in the guardianship situation, where the guardian acts voluntarily in filing acceptance. It is probable that the form of acceptance will expressly embody the provisions of this section, although the statute does not expressly require this.

       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] Under section 30.1-02-02, the court is designated as the proper court to handle matters relating to guardianship. The present section is intended to give jurisdiction to the forum where the ward resides as well as to the one where appointment initiated. This has primary importance where the ward’s residence has been moved from the appointing state. Because the court where acceptance of appointment is filed may as a practical matter be the only forum where jurisdiction over the person of the guardian may be obtained (by reason of section 30.1-27-08), that court is given concurrent jurisdiction.

       The guardian spouse or guardian parent of an adjudicated incapacitated person may, by will, appoint a successor guardian of the incapacitated person. A testamentary appointment by a guardian spouse or guardian parent becomes effective when, after having given seven days’ prior written notice of intention to do so to the incapacitated person and to the person caring for the incapacitated person or to the nearest adult relative of the incapacitated person, the successor guardian files acceptance of appointment in the court in which the will is informally or formally probated.

      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] This section, modeled after section 30.1-27-02, is designed to give the surviving parent, or the spouse, of an incapacitated person, the ability to confer the authority of a guardian on a person designated by will. This opportunity may be most useful in cases where parents, during their lifetime, have arranged an informal or voluntary commitment of an incompetent child, and are anxious to designate another who can maintain contact with the patient and act on his behalf without the necessity of a sanity hearing. The person designated by will must act by filing acceptance of the appointment. This provides a check against will directions which might prove to be unwise or unnecessary after the parents’ death. Moreover, the testamentary designee will have the risk of the possibility that the ward is not in fact incapacitated to prevent him from using the authority conferred to restrain the liberty of the ward. In cases of doubt, the testamentary appointee should petition for a court appointment under section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-03" target="_self">30.1-28-03</a></cite>.

     <p>
      The venue for guardianship proceedings for a proposed ward is in the place where the proposed ward resides or is present and expected to remain during the pendency of the proceedings. Notwithstanding section 30.1-02-03, the proposed ward may demand change of venue to either the county of residence or the county where the proposed ward is present. The court shall grant the demand if it is filed and served upon the petitioner more than three days before the hearing. If the demand is filed within three days of the hearing, the court may grant the demand upon good cause shown.

      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] Venue in guardianship proceedings lies in the county where the incapacitated person is present, as well as where he resides. Thus, if the person is temporarily away from his county of usual abode, the court of the county where he happens to be may handle requests for guardianship proceedings relating to him. In protective proceedings, venue is normally in the county of residence. See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-03" target="_self">30.1-29-03</a></cite>. See section 30.1-02-03 for disposition when venue is in two counties, and for transfer of venue.

It is not required that the visitor be a lawyer. [See section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-08" target="_self">30.1-28-08</a></cite>.] In urban areas, the visitor may be a social worker capable of determining the needs of the person for whom the appointment is sought.

       <p>
        Because a petitioner for removal of existing guardians failed to demonstrate that additional fees were authorized by statute or by the parties’ agreement, a district court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award additional attorney’s fees to her, and because there was statutory support for paying attorney’s fees of guardians and conservators under N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-28-03(9), 30.1-29-24(3)(w), (x) and the petitioner failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in awarding fees to the guardians and conservator, the district court’s fee awards were affirmed.

        Guardianship or conservatorship contemplates a legal proceeding in which the ward has had his or her authority withdrawn by a court order; no guardianship or conservatorship existed that withdrew the attorney's client's authority to act for himself.

       <p>
        In a guardianship case, a guardian ad litem fulfilled her duties under this statute when she stated that a guardianship was in the ward's best interest because she was not required to be the ward's advocate; the ward contended that the guardian should have advocated her wish to remain in her home and not have a guardian appointed. There was no indication that the guardian ad litem was retained as the ward's advocate. N.P. v. M.E. (In re M.E.), 2015 ND 267, 871 N.W.2d 435, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

        In a guardianship case, a ward's statutory rights were not violated because a district court substantially complied with this statute by accepting a physician's letter as the required physician's report. Even though an appointed expert refused to evaluate the ward, this letter provided a medical evaluation to the court satisfying the statutory requirements, and there was liberal construction of this title.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] The purpose of guardianship is to provide for the care of a person who is unable to care for himself. There is no reason to seek a guardian in those situations where the problems to be dealt with center around the property of a disabled person. In that event, a protective proceeding under chapter 30.1-29 may be in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is assumed that the standards suggested by the definition in section 30.1-26-01 for the “incapacitated” person are different from those which will determine when a person may be committed as mentally ill. For example, involuntary commitment proceedings may well be inappropriate unless it is determined that the patient is or probably will become dangerous to himself or the person or property of others. As indicated in section 30.1-26-01, the meaning of “incapacitated” turns on whether the subject lacks “understanding or capacity to make or communicate responsible decisions concerning his person”. There is overlap between the two sets of standards, but they are different. Hence, a finding that a person is “incapacitated” does not amount to a finding that he is mentally ill, or can be committed. In the reverse situation, if a person has been committed to institutional care and custody because of mental illness, it may be unnecessary to appoint a guardian for him. Nonetheless, it may be desirable to have a personal guardian for one who is or may be committed or who will be cared for by an institution. For one thing, a guardian, having custody, might arrange for a voluntary care arrangement like that which a parent for a minor and incapacitated child could establish. Moreover, the limited authority of a guardian over property of his ward may be appropriate in cases where the ward is committed. Because of the relationship between existing guardianship legislation and the handling of committed persons appears to vary considerably from state to state, the Code was deliberately left rather general on points relevant to the relationship. Section 30.1-28-12 qualifies the power of a guardian to determine the place of residence of a ward who has been committed.

        To balance the competing interests of protection and liberty in guardianship situations, trial courts are expected to use a clear and convincing evidentiary standard, while appellate review under N.D.R.Civ.P. 52(a) uses a more probing “clearly erroneous” standard.

         Burden of Proof
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Dakota concludes that the party proposing the transfer of a ward to a more restrictive living arrangement has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed placement is the least restrictive alternative available. This allocation of the burden of proof is in accord with the current trend of courts and legislatures to enhance the protections available to persons alleged to be incapable of caring for themselves or their property.
   Van Sickle v. Van Sickle (In re Guardianship of Van Sickle), 2005 ND 69, 694 N.W.2d 212, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 2005).

       <p>
        In a guardianship case, since a ward could not remember being exploited financially and was unable to drive, it was not error to deprive her of the right to marry or obtain a driver's license. However, the court erred in depriving the ward of the right to testify in judicial or administrative proceedings without a specific finding. N.P. v. M.E. (In re M.E.), 2015 ND 267, 871 N.W.2d 435, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 289</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        In a guardianship case, a court's findings regarding the ward's incapacity, the necessity of the guardianship, and the authority given to the co-guardians and the co-conservators were not clearly erroneous; the ward could not remember being exploited financially, she had overdosed on medication, she had fallen in her home several times, and she posed a fire danger due to smoking in her home.

        Read together, the definitions of “mental deficiency” and “incapacity” require an incapacity that endangers the person’s welfare. In re Guardianship of Braaten, 502 N.W.2d 512, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 136</cite> (N.D. 1993).

        Although the trial court properly found, by clear and convincing evidence, that a person was incapacitated for purposes of medical decisionmaking, its finding of complete incapacity was not supported by convincing evidence, and was clearly erroneous.

         Least Restrictive Alternative for Residence
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that a ward’s placement in a locked, dementia unit of a nursing home was the least restrictive alternative for his residence because his Alzheimer’s disease had been re-evaluated as “severe” and he had already wandered from his home, foster care would have to have been provided in a locked setting and would likely have been provided by people who did not have the training and experience of the people at the nursing home, and the ward was provided with a security net but also had an ability to be out of the facility and to have meaningful contacts.
   Van Sickle v. Van Sickle (In re Guardianship of Van Sickle), 2005 ND 69, 694 N.W.2d 212, 2005 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 77</cite> (N.D. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no violation of this statute in the appointment of a guardian because, regardless of who was appointed, a physician testified that the ward required constant supervision, whether through home care or at an assisted living facility. J.W. v. B.K.J. (In re Guardianship of the Pers. &amp; Conservatorship of the Estate of B.K.J.), 2015 ND 191, 867 N.W.2d 345, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 206</cite> (N.D. 2015).

      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] The proceedings under Article V are flexible. The court should not appoint a guardian unless one is necessary or desirable for the care of the person. If it develops that the needs of the person who is alleged to be incapacitated are not those which would call for a guardian, the court may adjust the proceeding accordingly. By acceptance of the appointment, the guardian submits to the court’s jurisdiction in much the same way as a personal representative.

    Termination of guardianship.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The authority and responsibility of a guardian for an incapacitated person terminates upon the death of the guardian or ward, except, the guardian may arrange for a deceased ward’s final disposition and refer the ward’s estate to probate, if no other person is available to perform those acts, the determination of incapacity of the guardian, or upon removal or resignation as provided in section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-07" target="_self">30.1-28-07</a></cite>. Testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding. Termination does not affect the guardian’s liability for prior acts nor the guardian’s obligation to account for funds and assets of the ward.

        As appellant never had a fair opportunity under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-28-11(4) to show why she should be appointed as her mother’s guardian, the trial judge erred (1) by not honoring a prior judge’s grant of appellant’s motion to reconsider the appointment of her siblings as guardians, and (2) by placing the burden on appellant to show why he should remove the guardians and appoint a successor under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-28-07(1).

        District court did not err in denying a ward's petition to be restored to capacity because the ward failed to establish a prima facie case for restoration to capacity; a psychologist's notes and a visitor's report were not sufficient to establish a prima facie case for termination of the guardianship, and the ward failed to present any further evidence. M.E. v. M.E., 2017 ND 121, 894 N.W.2d 877, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimate burden to prove the need for a guardianship remains with the party petitioning for guardianship, or on the guardian if a guardianship has been established; the statute does not limit how often a ward may petition for termination of the guardianship, and it, therefore, is appropriate that the ward make a prima facie showing she no longer is incapacitated before the burden shifts to the guardian to prove the ward remains incapacitated and the guardianship continue. M.E. v. M.E., 2017 ND 121, 894 N.W.2d 877, 2017 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 121</cite> (N.D. 2017).

        Where a guardian had been appointed for an incompetent in this state, a judgment of a court in another state of which she subsequently became a resident, determining her competent, was not conclusive in a proceeding to have her adjudged restored to competency.

       On petition by a person interested in the alleged incapacitated individual’s welfare, the court may appoint an emergency guardian if the court finds that compliance with the procedures of this chapter likely will result in substantial harm to the alleged incapacitated individual’s health, safety, or welfare, and that no other person appears to have authority and willingness to act in the circumstances. The court may appoint the guardian for a specified period of time, not to exceed ninety days. Immediately upon receipt of the petition for an emergency guardianship, the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem to advocate for the best interests of the alleged incapacitated individual in the proceeding and any subsequent proceeding. Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2, reasonable notice of the time and place of a hearing on the petition must be given to the alleged incapacitated individual, the individual’s spouse, if any, and any other person as the court directs.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-10.1ol12">
       An emergency guardian may be appointed without notice to the alleged incapacitated individual and the alleged incapacitated individual’s guardian ad litem only if the court finds from affidavit or other sworn testimony that the alleged incapacitated individual will be substantially harmed before a hearing on the appointment can be held. If the court appoints an emergency guardian without notice to the alleged incapacitated individual, the alleged incapacitated individual and the individual’s spouse, if any, must be given notice of the appointment within forty-eight hours after the appointment. The court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the appointment within ten days after the appointment.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-10.1ol13">
       If a conservator has not been appointed for the alleged incapacitated individual and the emergency guardian has authority for financial decisionmaking, the court’s order of appointment must state that the guardian shall safeguard any assets held by the alleged incapacitated individual and, during the period of appointment and subject to any further order of the court, may expend the individual’s assets only for the necessary support and care of the individual.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-10.1ol14">
       Appointment of an emergency guardian, with or without notice, is not a determination of the alleged incapacitated individual’s incapacity.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-28s30.1-28-10.1ol15">
       The court may remove an emergency guardian at any time. An emergency guardian shall make any report the court requires. In all other respects, the provisions of this chapter concerning guardians apply to an emergency guardian.

        District court did not abuse its discretion in appointing nephew as his aunt’s guardian and conservator under N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-28-11(4), 30.1-29-10(4) because it found that the nephew had no ownership or beneficiary interest in his aunt’s estate, would not accept any of her assets, and would waive his right to compensation if appointed. The aunt’s friend was willing to waive his right to compensation as guardian and conservator but was not willing to waive his right to take under the estate.

        Niece and a non-profit organization were properly appointed as co-guardians of a ward who suffered from Alzheimer's disease and dementia because this statute did not require the district court to make a specific finding that a person was of insufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice regarding appointing a guardian; there was no abuse of discretion in determining that the niece with equal priority to other relatives and the organization as the co-guardian were best qualified to serve. The district court was not of the opinion that the ward acted with or had sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice in this regard; the ward could not remember why she distrusted the niece and preferred other family members. J.W. v. B.K.J. (In re Guardianship of the Pers. &amp; Conservatorship of the Estate of B.K.J.), 2015 ND 191, 867 N.W.2d 345, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 206</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        District court did not err in not appointing a nephew as the conservator and guardian of his uncle because, while the court's written findings did not explain its reasons, the oral findings were adequate to understand that family conflict was the reason for the court's finding of good cause not to appoint the nephew as conservator and guardian.

        As appellant never had a fair opportunity under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-28-11(4) to show why she should be appointed as her mother’s guardian, the trial judge erred (1) by not honoring a prior judge’s grant of appellant’s motion to reconsider the appointment of her siblings as guardians, and (2) by placing the burden on appellant to show why he should remove the guardians and appoint a successor under N.D.C.C. § 30.1-28-07(1).

       To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of an order by a court of competent jurisdiction, the guardian is entitled to custody of the person of the ward and may establish the ward’s place of residence within or without this state.

      </p>
      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] The guardian is responsible for the care of the person of his ward. This section gives him the powers necessary to carry out this responsibility. Where there are no protective proceedings, the guardian also has limited authority over the property of the ward. Where the ward has substantial property, it may be desirable to have protective proceedings to handle his property problems. The same person, of course, may serve as guardian and conservator. Section 30.1-29-08 authorizes the court to make preliminary orders protecting the estate once a petition for appointment of a conservator is filed.

       <p>
        Trial court erred in denying a guardian’s request for compensation for services; the plain and ordinary meaning of the language of N.D.C.C. § 30.1-28-12(10) indicated the legislature intended to give a district court the discretion to consider what compensation was reasonable under the circumstances of any given guardianship, but the statutory language did not permit the district court to completely and preemptively reject a guardian’s request for compensation if such a request was reasonable.
   S.D.F. v. L.K. (In re V.J.V.N.), 2008 ND 106, 750 N.W.2d 462, 2008 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 109</cite> (N.D. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Patient or his estate was properly ordered to pay expenses arising from the appointment of a guardian/conservator because the guardian/conservator was entitled to reasonable compensation for services under N.D.C.C. 30.1-28-12 and N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-14" target="_self">30.1-29-14</a></cite>. The trial court had the discretion to determine the amount of reasonable compensation, the record did not show that the trial court misapplied the law in ordering the payment of expenses, and the trial court’s decision was not arbitrary, unconscionable, or unreasonable.

        A personal representative’s inquiry about the state of a decedent’s financial affairs, as required under N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-28-12 and 30.1-18-15(27) when those provisions are read together, includes contacting a known guardian about the decedent’s affairs; where such an inquiry would have uncovered the existence of a creditor who had sent a bill to a decedent’s guardian, that creditor was a reasonably ascertainable creditor for purposes of N.D.C.C. § <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1aIIIc30.1-19s30.1-19-01" target="_self">30.1-19-01</a></cite>.

        Trial court did not err in finding that a ward’s placement in a locked, dementia unit of a nursing home was the least restrictive alternative for his residence because his Alzheimer’s disease had been re-evaluated as “severe” and he had already wandered from his home, foster care would have to have been provided in a locked setting and would likely have been provided by people who did not have the training and experience of the people at the nursing home, and the ward was provided with a security net but also had an ability to be out of the facility and to have meaningful contacts.

       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Dakota concludes that the party proposing the transfer of a ward to a more restrictive living arrangement has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed placement is the least restrictive alternative available. This allocation of the burden of proof is in accord with the current trend of courts and legislatures to enhance the protections available to persons alleged to be incapable of caring for themselves or their property.

       Legislature intended to authorize court to allow additional compensation when services were rendered of such character and of such benefit to the ward or his estate as was in the judgment of court authorized or required.

      <p>
       Prior authorization by court was not necessary in order to entitle a guardian to be compensated for funds which he had expended, or for obligations assumed for benefit of ward in proper and necessary management of the estate. In re Gislason's Estate, 73 N.D. 731, 19 N.W.2d 447, 1945 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 87</cite> (N.D. 1945).

      <p>
       Where guardian incurred liability or expended moneys without previous court order authorizing them, he faced the hazard that court might not authorize the expenditure to be charged against assets of estate.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] This is the basic section of this part providing for protective proceedings for minors and disabled persons. “Protective proceedings” is a generic term used to describe proceedings to establish conservatorships and obtain protective orders. “Disabled persons” is used in this section to include a broad category of persons who, for a variety of different reasons, may be unable to manage their own property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the problems of property management are generally the same for minors and disabled persons, it was thought undesirable to treat these problems in two separate parts. Where there are differences, these have been separately treated in specific sections.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Comment to section 30.1-28-04, supra, points up the different meanings of incapacity (warranting guardianship), and disability.

        Appointment of a neutral conservator with limitations was proper for an elderly protected person with a large estate, cognitive decline, developing dementia, and two daughters in disagreement about the management of the estate; further, the daughter who initiated the conservatorship proceeding in good faith was properly awarded attorney fees from the estate.

        The trial court did not make a mistake in finding that the 87-year-old respondent was incapacitated as a result of her advanced age and physical and medical problems, resulting in an inability to manage her property and that she had substantial property necessitating the appointment of a conservator for the preservation of the property and its proper application. The trial court’s findings were, therefore, not clearly erroneous, and the trial court did not err in appointing a conservator. In re Conservatorship of Gessler, 419 N.W.2d 541, 1988 N.D.

       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] The section establishes a framework within which professionals, including the judge, attorney, and physician, if any, may be expected to exercise good judgment in regard to the minor or disabled person who is the subject of the proceeding. The National Conference accepts that it is desirable to rely on professionals rather than to attempt to draft detailed standards or conditions for appointment.

        District court had personal jurisdiction over a father and did not clearly err in finding clear and convincing evidence supported the appointment of a conservator because the father properly received notice of the proceeding, rejected his children's attempts to assist him manage his affairs, his cognition and reasoning after his stroke were not what they had been before, and he made uncharacteristic gifts that showed a likelihood to dissipate assets.

        In view of evidence that an individual’s financial affairs were currently in order and partially controlled through her living arrangement with a vocational adjustment workshop, the trial court erred in imposing a full and general conservatorship.

        This section gives the supervising court and the conservator similar authority regarding a protected person’s real property. In re Conservatorship of Kinney, 495 N.W.2d 69, 1993 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 7</cite> (N.D. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court’s formal order stating “(Testator) shall redraft any recently executed last will and testament” did not invalidate a subsequent will or violate subsection (2)(c) given that the will was in writing, was signed by the testator, and was signed by two witnesses. Furthermore, the attorney who prepared the will did so as the testator’s attorney in accordance with testator’s stated wishes with an independent attorney serving as an impartial observer over testator’s execution of the will, and no evidence existed that the court, testator’s attorney, or the independent attorney forced testator to sign the subsequent will. Bartusch v. Hager (In re Estate of Dion), 2001 ND 53, 623 N.W.2d 720, 2001 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 63</cite> (N.D. 2001).

        A court and conservator are not empowered to effectively defeat a protected person’s estate plan and intentions set forth in a valid will through the creation of a revocable living trust that depletes the estate that would have otherwise passed to intended beneficiaries. Oliver v. Braaten (In re Sickles), 518 N.W.2d 673, 1994 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 130</cite> (N.D. 1994).

       <p>
        Appointment of a neutral conservator with limitations was proper for an elderly protected person with a large estate, cognitive decline, developing dementia, and two daughters in disagreement about the management of the estate; further, the daughter who initiated the conservatorship proceeding in good faith was properly awarded attorney fees from the estate.
   E.P. v. T.K. (In re Conservatorship of T.K.), 2009 ND 195, 775 N.W.2d 496, 2009 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 205</cite> (N.D. 2009).

       <p>
        District court erred in authorizing a limited conservator to assign a father's potential legal claims because it was not clear whether the district court authorized the conservator to assign the legal claims or whether it authorized the conservator to delegate its power to investigate and pursue the claims; it was also not clear what the district court meant by the language stating that the claims were assigned to the children in “equal shares.” P.M. v. V.A.M. (In re Estate
   of V.A.M.), 2015 ND 247, 870 N.W.2d 201, 2015 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 267</cite> (N.D. 2015).

        A trial court’s findings concerning competency are questions of fact which will not be overturned on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. In re Bo, 365 N.W.2d 847, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 286</cite> (N.D. 1985).

        Because a supervising court and a conservator have similar discretionary authority regarding a protected person’s estate, and a supervising court’s decision regarding that property is reviewable under an abuse of discretion standard, a county court’s decision authorizing a conservator to sell a protected person’s homestead was reviewed under that standard.

      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] It is important that the provision be made for the approval of single transactions or the establishment of protective arrangements as alternatives to full conservatorship. Under present law, a guardianship often must be established simply to make possible a valid transfer of land or securities. This section eliminates the necessity of the establishment of long-term arrangements in this situation.

        District court did not abuse its discretion in appointing nephew as his aunt’s guardian and conservator under N.D.C.C. §§ 30.1-28-11(4), 30.1-29-10(4) because it found that the nephew had no ownership or beneficiary interest in his aunt’s estate, would not accept any of her assets, and would waive his right to compensation if appointed. The aunt’s friend was willing to waive his right to compensation as guardian and conservator but was not willing to waive his right to take under the estate.

        Where an elderly protected person had a large estate, cognitive decline, developing dementia, and two daughters in disagreement about the management of the estate, there was good cause to appoint a neutral conservator with limitations rather than the caretaker daughter who was the most recent nomination in the protected person’s durable power of attorney because that daughter did not have the financial qualifications to manage the estate.

        District court did not err in not appointing a nephew as the conservator and guardian of his uncle because, while the court's written findings did not explain its reasons, the oral findings were adequate to understand that family conflict was the reason for the court's finding of good cause not to appoint the nephew as conservator and guardian.

        Patient or his estate was properly ordered to pay expenses arising from the appointment of a guardian/conservator because the guardian/conservator was entitled to reasonable compensation for services under N.D.C.C. 30.1-28-12 and N.D.C.C. <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-14" target="_self">30.1-29-14</a></cite>.

     <p>
      The appointment of a conservator vests in the conservator title as trustee to all property of the protected person, presently held or thereafter acquired, including title to any property theretofore held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys in fact, or to the part thereof specified in the order. An order specifying that only a part of the property of the protected person vests in the conservator creates a limited conservatorship. The appointment of a conservator is not a transfer or alienation within the meaning of general provisions of any federal or state statute or regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will, or trust instrument imposing restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by the protected person of the protected person’s rights or interest, but this section does not restrict the ability of persons to make specific provision by contract or dispositive instrument relating to a conservator.

      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] This section permits independent administration of the property of protected persons once the appointment of a conservator had been obtained. Any interested person may require the conservator to account in accordance with section <cite class="ocnd"><a href="#t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-19" target="_self">30.1-29-19</a></cite>. As a trustee, a conservator holds title to the property of the protected person. The appointment of a conservator is a serious matter and the court must select him with great care. Once appointed, he is free to carry on his fiduciary responsibilities. If he should default in these in any way, he may be made to account to the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike a situation involving appointment of a guardian, the appointment of a conservator has no bearing on the capacity of the disabled person to contract or engage in other transactions.

     <p>
      Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of all assets, or the part thereof specified in the letters, of a protected person to the conservator. An order terminating a conservatorship is evidence of transfer of all assets of the estate subjected to the conservatorship from the conservator to the protected person or the protected person’s successors. Subject to the requirements of general statutes governing the filing or recordation of documents of title to land or other property, letters of conservatorship, and orders terminating conservatorships, may be filed or recorded to give record notice of title as between the conservator and the protected person.

    Persons dealing with conservators — Protection.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with the conservator for value in any transaction other than those requiring a court order as provided in section 30.1-29-08 is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 30.1-29-26 are effective as to third persons. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator. The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters. The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

        It was error to dismiss a lessee’s breach of contract claims against a sublessee based on the statutory protection for persons dealing with conservators, when the sublessee had a separate lease with the lessor’s conservator, because the lessee’s lease with the sublessee was not a transaction with a conservator.

        Decision denying a claim to an estate was reversed because, although a conservator had broad discretion to act on behalf of a decedent, the record did not show if money stolen from a certificate of deposit (COD) that was in a payable on death account was put in a guardianship account after it was returned due to necessity and insufficient alternative funds under
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-12; also, several beneficiaries had no present interest in the COD as a payable on death account. Moreover, there was nothing to show whether a conservator was aware that the money had been in payable on death account as part of an estate plan or whether the conservator even knew that he had the power to return the funds to the pre-theft state.
   Thus, remand was necessary for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the conservator properly exercised its powers under N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-29. Allmaras v. Manly (In re Estate of Allmaras), 2007 ND 130, 737 N.W.2d 612, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person and the protected person’s dependents in accordance with the following principles:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11a">
         The conservator is to consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard of support, education, and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any. The conservator may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually furnishing support, education, or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless the conservator knows that the parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit therefrom, including relief from any personal duty of support, or unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of the protected person.
        </li>
        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11b">
         The conservator is to expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person with due regard to:
         <ol>
          <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11b1">
           The size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship, and the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to manage the protected person’s affairs and the estate which has been conserved for the protected person.
          </li>
          <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11b2">
           The accustomed standard of living of the protected person and members of the protected person’s household.
          </li>
          <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11b3">
           Other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person.

        </li>
        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11c">
         The conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person’s household, who are unable to support themselves, and who are in need of support.
        </li>
        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol11d">
         Funds expended under this subsection may be paid by the conservator to any person, including the protected person, to reimburse for expenditures that the conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is reasonable to expect that they will be performed and advance payments are customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol12">
       If the estate is ample to provide for the purposes implicit in the distributions authorized by the preceding subsection, a conservator for a protected person other than a minor has power to make gifts to charity and other objects as the protected person might have been expected to make, in amounts which do not exceed in total for any year twenty percent of the income from the estate.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol13">
       When a minor who has not been adjudged disabled under subsection 2 of section 30.1-29-01 attains majority, the minor’s conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol14">
       When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person’s disability other than minority has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-25ol15">
       If a protected person dies, the conservator shall deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person which may have come into the conservator’s possession, inform the executor or a beneficiary named therein that the conservator has done so, and retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the decedent or other persons entitled thereto. If after forty days from the death of the protected person no other person has been appointed personal representative and no application or petition for appointment is before the court, the conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative so that the conservator may proceed to administer and distribute the decedent’s estate without additional or further appointment. Upon application for an order granting the powers of a personal representative to a conservator, after notice to any person demanding notice under section 30.1-13-04 and to any person nominated executor in any will of which the applicant is aware, the court may order the conferral of the power upon determining that there is no objection, and endorse the letters of the conservator to note that the formerly protected person is deceased and that the conservator has acquired all of the powers and duties of a personal representative. The making and entry of an order under this section shall have the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as provided in section 30.1-14-08 and chapters 30.1-17 through 30.1-21, except that estate in the name of the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent’s successors without prior retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.

       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] This section sets out those situations wherein the conservator may distribute property or disburse funds during the continuance of or on termination of the trust. Section 30.1-29-16, subsection 2, makes it clear that a conservator may seek instructions from the court on questions arising under this section. Subsection 5 of this section is derived in part from § 11.80.150 Revised Code of Washington [RCWA 11.80.150].

        The rules relating to disbursement of a minor’s personal injury judgment create a two-prong test that the lower court must apply. First, the court must determine whether it is necessary to invade the award. If so, the court may, in its discretion, expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the support, education, care, or benefit of the protected person. Because the allocation of funds is related solely to the benefit of the child, the award does not transform into community property. Dahner v. Daner, 374 N.W.2d 604, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D.

      </p>
      <p>
       [See note preceding General Editorial Board Comment to Article V regarding revisions to UPC not adopted by North Dakota.] This section makes it possible to appoint a fiduciary whose powers are limited to part of the estate or who may conduct important transactions, such as sales and mortgages of land, only with special court authorization. In the latter case, a conservator would be in much the position of a guardian of property under the law currently in force in most states, except that he would have title to the property. The purpose of giving conservators title as trustees is to ensure that the provisions for protection of third parties have full effect. The Veterans Administration may insist that, when it is paying benefits to a minor or disabled, the letters of conservatorship limit powers to those of a guardian under the Uniform Veteran’s Guardianship Act and require the conservator to file annual accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The court may not only limit the powers of the conservator but may expand his powers so as to make it possible for him to act as the court itself might act.

      In investing the estate, and in selecting assets of the estate for distribution under subsections 1 and 2 of section 30.1-29-25, in utilizing powers of revocation or withdrawal available for the support of the protected person, and exercisable by the conservator or the court, the conservator and the court should take into account any known estate plan of the protected person, including the protected person’s will, any revocable trust of which the protected person is settlor, and any contract, transfer, or joint ownership arrangement with provisions for payment or transfer of benefits or interests at the protected person’s death to another or others which the protected person may have originated. The conservator may examine the will of the protected person.

        Decision denying a claim to an estate was reversed because, although a conservator had broad discretion to act on behalf of a decedent, the record did not show if money stolen from a certificate of deposit (COD) that was in a payable on death account was put in a guardianship account after it was returned due to necessity and insufficient alternative funds under
   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-12; also, several beneficiaries had no present interest in the COD as a payable on death account. Moreover, there was nothing to show whether a conservator was aware that the money had been in payable on death account as part of an estate plan or whether the conservator even knew that he had the power to return the funds to the pre-theft state.
   Thus, remand was necessary for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the conservator properly exercised its powers under N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-29. Allmaras v. Manly (In re Estate of Allmaras), 2007 ND 130, 737 N.W.2d 612, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2007).

        Where a county court’s decision to allow the conservator of an estate to sell the protected person’s automobile, homestead, and household goods was the product of a rational mental process by which the facts in the record and the applicable law were considered together to achieve a reasoned and reasonable determination, the court did not abuse its discretion.

       A conservator must pay from the estate all just claims against the estate and against the protected person arising before or after the conservatorship upon their presentation and allowance. A claim may be presented by either of the following methods:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-28ol11a">
         The claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-28ol12">
       A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of the claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable statute of limitation, and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance and payment from the estate. If a proceeding is pending against a protected person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected person thereafter, the moving party must give notice of the proceeding to the conservator if the outcome is to constitute a claim against the estate.
      </li>
      <li id="t30.1a0Vc30.1-29s30.1-29-28ol13">
       If it appears that the estate in conservatorship is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference is to be given to prior claims for the care, maintenance, and education of the protected person or the protected person’s dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A claim is deemed presented on the first to occur of either receipt of the written statement of claim by the conservator, or the filing of the claim with the court. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement mailed by the conservator to the claimant within sixty days after its presentation. The presentation of a claim tolls any statute of limitation relating to the claim until thirty days after its disallowance.

     <p>
      A durable power of attorney is a power of attorney by which a principal designates another as the principal’s attorney in fact in writing and the writing contains the words “This power of attorney is not affected by subsequent disability or incapacity of the principal or by lapse of time,” or “This power of attorney becomes effective upon the disability or incapacity of the principal,” or similar words showing the intent of the principal that the authority conferred is exercisable notwithstanding the principal’s subsequent disability or incapacity, and, unless it states a time of termination, notwithstanding the lapse of time since the execution of the instrument.

       This section, derived from the first sentence of UPC 5-501 (1969) (1975), is a definitional section that supports use of the term “durable power of attorney” in the sections that follow. The second quoted expression was designed to emphasize that a durable power with postponed effectiveness is permitted. Some UPC critics have been bothered by the reference here to a later condition of “disability or incapacity,” a circumstance that may be difficult to ascertain if it can be established without a Court order. The answer, of course, is that draftsmen of durable powers are not limited in their choice of words to describe the later time when the principal wishes the authority of the agent in fact to become operative. For example, a durable power might be framed to confer authority commencing when two or more named persons, possibly including the principal’s lawyer, physician or spouse, concur that the principal has become incapable of managing his affairs in a sensible and efficient manner and deliver a signed statement to that effect to the attorney in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this and following sections, it is assumed that the principal is competent when the power of attorney is signed. If this is not the case, nothing in this Act is intended to alter the result that would be reached under general principles of law.

       Grantor’s power of attorney was a durable power of attorney because the document’s specific language provided that the powers granted to the named agents were not affected by the grantor’s becoming disabled, incompetent, or incapacitated or the lapse of time. The power of attorney stated it was the grantor’s intent that the authority conferred would be exercisable notwithstanding physical disability or mental incompetence.

      <p>
       This section is derived from the second sentence of UPC 5-501 (1969) (1975) modified by deleting reference to the effect on a durable power of the principal’s death, a matter that is now covered in Section [4] [5-504] [N.D.C.C. §
   30.1-30-04] which provides a single standard for durable and non-durable powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The words “any period of disability or incapacity of the principal” are intended to include periods during which the principal is legally incompetent, but are not intended to be limited to such periods. In the Uniform Probate Code, the word “disability” is defined, and the term “incapacitated person” is defined. In the context of this section, however, the important point is that the terms embrace “legal incompetence,” as well as less grievous disadvantages.

      <p>
       Subsection (a) [subsection (1)] closely resembles the last two sentences of UPC § 5-501 (1969) (1975); most of the changes are stylistic. One change going beyond style states that an agent in fact is accountable both to the principal and a conservator or guardian if a Court has appointed a fiduciary; the earlier version described accountability only to the fiduciary.
      </p>
      <p>
       As explained in the introductory comment, the purpose of subsection (b) [subsection (2)] is to emphasize that agencies under durable powers and guardians or conservators may co-exist. It is not the purpose of the act to encourage resort to Court for a fiduciary appointment that should be largely unnecessary when an alternative regime has been provided via a durable power. Indeed, the best reason for permitting a principal to use a durable power to express his preference regarding any future Court appointee charged with the care and protection of his person or estate may be to secure the authority of the attorney in fact against upset by arranging matters so that the likely appointee in any future protective proceedings will be the attorney in fact or another equally congenial to the principal and his plans. However, the evolution of a free-standing durable power act increases the prospects that UPC-type statutes covering protective proceedings will not apply when a protective proceeding is commenced for one who has created a durable power. This means that a receiving a petition for a guardian or conservator may not be governed by standards like those in UPC § 5-304 (personal guardians) and § 5-401(2) and related sections [North Dakota has not adopted the current versions of these sections] which are designed to deter unnecessary protective proceedings. Finally, attorneys and others may find various good uses for a regime in which a conservator directs exercise of an agent’s authority under a durable power. For example, the combination would confer jurisdiction on the Court handling the protective proceeding to approve or ratify a desirable transaction that might not be possible without the protection of a Court order. The alternative of a declaratory judgment proceeding might be difficult or impossible in some states.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is to be noted that the “fiduciary” described in subsection (a), to whom an attorney in fact under a durable power is accountable and who may revoke or amend the durable power, does not include a guardian of the person only. In subsection (b), however, the authority of a principal to nominate extends to a guardian of the person as well as to conservators and guardians of estates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Discussion of this section in NCCUSL’s Committee of the Whole involved the question of whether an agent’s accountability, as described here, might be effectively countermanded by appropriate language in a power of attorney. The response was negative. The reference is to basic accountability like that owed by every fiduciary to his beneficiary and that distinguishes a fiduciary relationship from those involving gifts or general powers of appointment. The section is not intended to describe a particular form of accounting. Hence, the context differs from those involving statutory duties to account in Court, or with specified frequency, where draftsmen of controlling instruments may be able to excuse statutory details relating to accountings without affecting the general principle of accountability.

      <p>
       UPC §§ 5-501 and 5-502 (1969) (1975) are flawed by different standards for durable and nondurable powers vis a vis the protection of an attorney in fact who purports to exercise a power after the principal has died. Section 5-501 (1969) (1975), applicable only to durable powers, expresses a most unsatisfactory standard; i.e. the attorney in fact is protected if the exercise occurs “during any period of uncertainty as to whether the principal is dead or alive …” Section 5-502 (1969) (1975), applicable only to non-durable powers, protects the agent who “without actual knowledge of the death … of the principal, acts in good faith under the power of attorney…” Section [4] [5- 504](a) [subsection (1)] expresses as a single test the standard now contained in § 5-502 (1969) (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) [subsection (2)], applicable only to nondurable powers that are controlled by the traditional view that a principal’s loss of capacity ends the authority of his agents, embodies the substance of UPC § 5-502 (1969) (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The discussion in the Committee of the Whole established that the language “or other person” in subsections (a) and (b) is intended to refer to persons who transact business with the attorney in fact under the authority conferred by the power. Consequently, persons in this category who act in good faith and without the actual knowledge described in the subsections are protected by the statute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, there was discussion of possible conflict between the actual knowledge test here prescribed for protection of persons relying on the continuance of a power and constructive notice concepts under statutes governing the recording of instruments affecting real estate. The view was expressed in the Committee of the Whole that the recording statutes would continue to control since those statutes are specifically designed to encourage public recording of documents affecting land titles. It was also suggested that “good faith,” as required by this section, might be lacking in the unlikely case of one who, without actual knowledge of the principal’s death or incompetency, accepted a conveyance executed by an attorney in fact without checking the public record where he would have found an instrument disclosing the principal’s death or incompetency. If so, there would be no conflict between this act and recording statutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is to be noted, also, that this section deals only with the effect of a principal’s death or incompetency as a revocation of a power of attorney; it does not relate to an express revocation of a power or to the expiration of a power according to its terms. Further, since a durable power is not revoked by incapacity, the section’s coverage of revocation of powers of attorney by the principal’s incapacity is restricted to powers that are not durable. The only effect of the Act on rules governing express revocations of powers of attorney is as described in Section [5] [5-505] [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-30-05].

     <p>
      As to acts undertaken in good faith reliance thereon, an affidavit executed by the attorney in fact under a power of attorney, durable or otherwise, stating that the attorney in fact did not have at the time of exercise of the power actual knowledge of the termination of the power by revocation or of the principal’s death, disability, or incapacity is conclusive proof of the nonrevocation or nontermination of the power at that time. If the exercise of the power of attorney requires execution and delivery of any instrument that is recordable, the affidavit when authenticated for record is likewise recordable. This section does not affect any provision in a power of attorney for its termination by expiration of time or occurrence of an event other than express revocation or a change in the principal’s capacity.

      <p>
       This section, embodying the substance and form of UPC 5-502(b)(1969) (1975), has been extended to apply to durable powers. It is unclear whether UPC 5-502(b) (1969) (1975) applies to durable powers. Affidavits protecting persons dealing with attorneys in fact extend the utility of powers of attorney and plainly should be available for use by all attorneys in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       The matters stated in an affidavit that are strengthened by this section are limited to the revocation of a power by the principal’s voluntary act, his death, or, in the case of non-durable power, by his incompetence. With one possible exception, other matters, including circumstances made relevant by the terms of the instrument to the commencement of the agency or to its termination by other circumstances, are not covered. The exception concerns the case of a power created to begin on “incapacity.” The affidavit of the agent in fact that all conditions necessary to the valid exercise of the power might be aided by the statute in relation to the fact of incapacity. An affidavit as to the existence or nonexistence of facts and circumstances not covered by this section nonetheless may be useful in establishing good faith reliance.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If any power of attorney, durable or otherwise, or other writing authorizes an attorney in fact or other agent to perform any act that the principal might or could do or evidences the principal’s intent to give the attorney in fact or agent full power to handle the principal’s affairs or deal with the principal’s property, the attorney in fact or agent may make gifts. The gifts may be in any amount of any of the principal’s property to any individual or to an organization described in sections 170(c) and 2522(a) of the Internal Revenue Code or corresponding future provisions of federal tax law, or both. Notwithstanding this section, a principal, by express words in the power of attorney or other writing, may authorize, or limit the authority of, any attorney in fact or other agent to make gifts of the principal’s property. This section applies to a power of attorney executed before August 1, 1995, as well as a power of attorney executed after July 31, 1995.

        Adoption of Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act.
       </b>
       Part 5 of Article V of the Uniform Probate Code was amended by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1979. Sections 5–501 to 5– 505, as enacted in 1979, are identical to sections 1 to 5 of the Uniform Durable Power of Attorney Act (see Volume 8A Uniform Laws Annotated, Master Edition), also approved by the National Conference in 1979 as an alternative to Part 5 of Article V of the Uniform Probate Code. See Prefatory Note, post.

       <b>
        PREFATORY NOTE.
       </b>
       The National Conference included Sections 5-501 and 5-502 in Uniform Probate Code (1969) (1975) concerning powers of attorney to assist persons interested in establishing non-Court regimes for the management of their affairs in the event of later incompetency or disability. The purpose was to recognize a form of senility insurance comparable to that available to relatively wealthy persons who use funded, revocable trusts for persons who are unwilling or unable to transfer assets as required to establish a trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions included in the original UPC modify two principles that have controlled written powers of attorney. Section 5-501 (UPC (1969) (1975)), creating what has come to be known as a “durable power of attorney,” permits a principal to create an agency in another that continues in spite of the principal’s later loss of capacity to contract. The only requirement is that an instrument creating a durable power contain language showing that the principal intends the agency to remain effective in spite of his later incompetency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 5-502 (UPC (1969) (1975)) alters the common law rule that a principal’s death ends the authority of his agents and voids all acts occurring thereafter including any done in complete ignorance of the death. The new view, applicable to durable and nondurable, written powers of attorney, validates post-mortem exercise of authority by agents who act in good faith and without actual knowledge of the principal’s death. The idea here was to encourage use of powers of attorney by removing a potential trap for agents in fact and third persons who decide to rely on a power at a time when they cannot be certain that the principal is then alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       To the knowledge of the Joint Editorial Board for the Uniform Probate Code, the only statutes resembling the power of attorney sections of the UPC (1969) (1975) that had been enacted prior to the approval and promulgation of the Code were Sections 11-9.1 and 11-9.2 of Code of Virginia [1950]. Since then, a variety of UPC inspired statutes adjusting agency rules have been enacted in more than thirty states.
      </p>
      <p>
       This [Act] [Section] originated in 1977 with a suggestion from within the National Conference that a new free-standing uniform act, designed to make powers of attorney more useful, would be welcome in many states. For states that have yet to adopt durable power legislation, this new National Conference product represents a respected, collective judgment, identifying the best of the ideas reflected in the recent flurry of new state laws on the subject; additional enactments of a new and improved uniform act should result. For other states that have acted already, this new act offers a reason to consider amendments, including elimination of restrictions that no longer appear necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the course of preparing this Section, the Joint Editorial Board for the Uniform Probate Code, acting as a Special Committee on the new project, evolved what it considers to be improvements in §§ 5-501 and 5-502 of the 1969 and 1975 versions of the Code. In the main, the changes reflect stylistic matters. However, the idea reflected in Section 3(a)—that draftsmen of powers of attorney may wish to anticipate the appointment of a conservator or guardian for the principal—is new, and a brief explanation is in order.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the Code was originally drafted, the dominant idea was that durable powers would be used as alternatives to Court-oriented, protective procedures. Hence, the draftsmen merely provided that appointment of a conservator for a principal who had granted a durable power to another did not automatically revoke the agency; rather, it would be up to the Court’s appointee to determine whether revocation was appropriate. The provision was designed to discourage the institution of Court proceedings by persons interested solely in ending an agent’s authority. It later appeared sensible to adjust the durable power concept so that it may be used either as an alternative to a protective procedure, or as a designed supplement enabling nomination of the principal’s choice for guardian to an appointing Court and continuing to authorize efficient estate management under the direction of a Court appointee.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sponsoring committee considered and rejected the suggestion that the word “durable” be omitted from the title. While it is true that the act describes “durable” and “non-durable” powers of attorney, this is merely the result of use of language to accomplish a purpose of making both categories of power more reliable for use than formerly. In the case of non-durable powers, the act extends validity by the provisions in Section [4] [5-504] protecting agents in fact and third persons who rely in good faith on a power of attorney when, unknown to them, the principal is incompetent or deceased. The general purpose of the act is to alter common law rules that created traps for the unwary by voiding powers on the principal’s incompetency or death. The act does not purport to deal with other aspects of powers of attorney, and a label that would result from dropping “durable” would be misleading to the extent that it suggested otherwise.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is a revised version of former Section 6-201 of the original Uniform Probate Code, which authorized a variety of contractual arrangements that had sometimes been treated as testamentary in prior law. For example, most Courts treated as testamentary a provision in a promissory note that if the payee died before making payment, the note should be paid to another named person; or a provision in a land contract that if the seller died before completing payment, the balance should be canceled and the property should belong to the vendee. These provisions often occurred in family arrangements. The result of holding such provisions testamentary was usually to invalidate them because not executed in accordance with the statute of wills. On the other hand, the same Courts for years upheld beneficiary designations in life insurance contracts. The drafters of the original Uniform Probate Code declared in the Comment that they were unable to identify policy reasons for continuing to treat these varied arrangements as testamentary. The drafters said that the benign experience with such familiar will substitutes as the revocable inter vivos trust, the multiple-party bank account, and United States government bonds payable on death to named beneficiaries all demonstrated that the evils envisioned if the statute of wills were not rigidly enforced simply do not materialize. The Comment also observed that because these provisions often are part of a business transaction and are evidenced by a writing, the danger of fraud is largely eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the modes of transfer authorized by an instrument under this section are declared to be nontestamentary, the instrument does not have to be executed in compliance with the formalities for wills prescribed under Section 2-502 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-02]; nor does the instrument have to be probated, nor does the personal representative have any power or duty with respect to the assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sole purpose of this section is to prevent the transfers authorized here from being treated as testamentary. This section does not invalidate other arrangements by negative implication. Thus, this section does not speak to the phenomenon of the oral trust to hold property at death for named persons, an arrangement already generally enforceable under trust law.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to a “marital property agreement” in the introductory portion of subsection (a) of Section 6-101 includes an agreement made during marriage as well as a premarital contract.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “or other written instrument of a similar nature” in the introductory portion of subsection (a) replaces the former language “or any other written instrument effective as a contract, gift, conveyance or trust” in the original Section 6-201. The Supreme Court of Washington read that language to relieve against the delivery requirement of the law of deeds, a result that was not intended. Estate of O’Brien v. Woodhouse, 109 Wash.2d 913, 749 P.2d 154 (1988). The point was correctly decided in First National Bank in Minot v. Bloom, 264 N.W.2d 208, 212 (N.D.1978), in which the Supreme Court of North Dakota held that “nothing in [former Section 6-201] of the Uniform Probate Code . . . eliminates the necessity of delivery of a deed to effectuate a conveyance from one living person to another.”

        As N.D.C.C. § 47-11-07 is a general provision dealing with all oral gifts, while this chapter contains specific provisions governing joint accounts and disposition of funds remaining on deposit at death, any conflict between N.D.C.C. § 47-11-07 and N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-31 would be resolved in favor of the latter. 508 N.W.2d 360.

        Editorial Board Comment.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This and the sections that follow are designed to reduce certain questions concerning many forms of multiple-person accounts (including the so-called Totten trust account). A “payable on death” designation and an “agency” designation are also authorized for both single-party and multiple-party accounts. The POD designation is a more direct means of achieving the same purpose as a Totten trust account; this part therefore discourages creation of a Totten trust account and treats existing Totten trust accounts as POD designations.
      </p>
      <p>
       An agent (paragraph (2)) may not be a party. The agency designation must be signed by all parties, and the agent is the agent of all parties. See Section 6-205 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-06] (designation of agent).
      </p>
      <p>
       A “beneficiary” of a party (paragraph (3)) may be either a POD beneficiary or the beneficiary of a Totten trust; the two types of designations in an account serve the same function and are treated the same under this part. See paragraph (8) (“POD designation” defined). The definition of “beneficiary” refers to a “person,” who may be an individual, corporation, organization, or other legal entity. Section 1-201(29) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06(4)]. Thus a church, trust company, family corporation, or other entity, as well as any individual, may be designated as a beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The term “multiple-party account” (paragraph 5)) is used in this part in a broad sense to include any account having more than one owner with a present interest in the account. Thus an account may be a “multiple-party account” within the meaning of this part regardless of whether the terms of the account refer to it as “joint tenancy” or as “tenancy in common,” regardless of whether the parties named are coupled by “or” or “and,” and regardless of whether any reference is made to survivorship rights, whether expressly or by abbreviation such as JTWROS or JT TEN. Survivorship rights in a multiple-party account are determined by the terms of the account and by statute, and survivorship is not a necessary incident of a multiple-party account. See Section 6-212 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-09] (rights at death).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under paragraph (6), a “party” is a person with a present right to payment from an account. Therefore, present owners of a multiple-party account are parties, as is the present owner of an account with a POD designation. The beneficiary of an account with a POD designation is not a party, but is entitled to payment only on the death of all parties. The trustee of a Totten trust is a party but the beneficiary is not. An agent with the right of withdrawal on behalf of a party is not itself a party. A person claiming on behalf of a party such as a guardian or conservator, or claiming the interest of a party such as a creditor, is not itself a party, and the right of such a person to payment is governed by general law other than this part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Various signature requirements may be involved in order to meet the payment requirements of the account. A “request” (paragraph (10)) involves compliance with these requirements. A party is one to whom an account is presently payable without regard to whose signature may be required for a “request.”

       In the case of an account established before (or after) the effective date of this part that is not in substantially the form provided in Section 6-204 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-05], the account is governed by the provisions of this part applicable to the type of account that most nearly conforms to the depositor’s intent. See Section 6-204 (forms).
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, a tenancy in common account established before or after the effective date of this part would be classified as a “multiple-party account” for purposes of this part. See Section 6-201(5) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-02(5)] (“multiple-party account” defined). On death of a party there would not be a right of survivorship since the tenancy in common title would be treated as a multiple-party account without right of survivorship. See Section 6-212(c) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-09(3)]. It should be noted that a POD designation may not be made in a multiple-party account without right of survivorship. See Sections 6-201(8) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-02(8)] (“POD designation” defined), 6-204 (forms), and 6-212 (rights at death).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section, a Totten trust account established before, on, or after the effective date of this part is governed by the provisions of this part applicable to an account with a POD designation. See Section 6-201(8) (“POD designation” defined) and the Comment to Section 6-201.

       This section provides short forms for single- and multiple-party accounts which, if used, bring the accounts within the terms of this part. A financial institution that uses the statutory form language in its accounts is protected in acting in reliance on the form of the account. See also Section 6-226 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-19] (discharge).
      </p>
      <p>
       The forms provided in this section enable a person establishing a multiple-party account to state expressly in the account whether there are to be survivorship rights between the parties. The account forms permit greater flexibility than traditional account designations. It should be noted that no separate form is provided for a Totten trust account, since the POD designation serves the same function.
      </p>
      <p>
       An account that is not substantially in the form provided in this section is nonetheless governed by this part. See Section 6-203 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-04] (types of account; existing accounts).

       An agent has no beneficial interest in the account. See Section 6-211 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-08] (ownership during lifetime). The agency relationship is governed by the general law of agency of the state, except to the extent this part provides express rules, including the rule that the agency survives the disability or incapacity of a party.
      </p>
      <p>
       A financial institution may make payments at the direction of an agent notwithstanding disability, incapacity, or death of the party, subject to receipt of a stop notice. Section 6-226 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-19] (discharge); see also Section 6-224 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-17] (payment to designated agent).

        Editorial Board Comment.

      </p>
      <p>
       This section reflects the assumption that a person who deposits funds in an account normally does not intend to make an irrevocable gift of all or any part of the funds represented by the deposit. Rather, the person usually intends no present change of beneficial ownership. The section permits parties to accounts to be as definite, or as indefinite, as they wish in respect to the matter of how beneficial ownership should be apportioned between them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assumption that no present change of beneficial ownership is intended may be disproved by showing that a gift was intended. For example, under subsection (c) it is presumed that the beneficiary of a POD designation has no present ownership interest during lifetime. However, it is possible that in the case of a POD designation in trust form an irrevocable gift was intended.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to note that the section is limited to ownership of an account while parties are alive. Section 6-212 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-09] prescribes what happens to beneficial ownership on the death of a party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The section does not undertake to describe the situation between parties if one party withdraws more than that party is then entitled to as against the other party. Sections 6-221 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-14] and 6-226 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-19] protect a financial institution in that circumstance without reference to whether a withdrawing party may be entitled to less than that party withdraws as against another party. Rights between parties in this situation are governed by general law other than this part.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Net contribution” as defined by subsection (a) has no application to the financial institution-depositor relationship. Rather, it is relevant only to controversies that may arise between parties to a multiple-party account. The last sentence of subsection (b) provides a clear rule concerning the amount of “net contribution” in a case where the actual amount cannot be established as between spouses. This part otherwise contains no provision dealing with a failure of proof. The omission is deliberate. The theory of these sections is that the basic relationship of the parties is that of individual ownership of values attributable to their respective deposits and withdrawals, and not equal and undivided ownership that would be an incident of joint tenancy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a state that recognizes tenancy by the entireties for personal property, this section would not change the rule that parties who are married to each other own their combined net contributions to an account as tenants by the entireties. See Section 6-216 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-13] (community property and tenancy by the entireties).

        District court properly dismissed a son’s complaint against his brother—for contempt of court and unjust enrichment—with prejudice because, while the son appeared to claim an interest in their deceased mother’s investment account as a beneficiary, he lacked standing where he never had a vested interest in the investment account, the summons and interim order were not entered for his protection, and, even assuming that he suffered some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action, he was not asserting his own legal rights and interests, but rather his claims rested on the legal rights and interests of his father in the parents’ divorce action.

       The effect of subsection (a) is to make an account payable to one or more of two or more parties a survivorship arrangement unless a nonsurvivorship arrangement is specified in the terms of the account. This rule applies to community property as well as other forms of marital property. See Section 6-216 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-13] (community property and tenancy by the entireties).

       By technical amendment effective August 5, 1991, the word “part” was substituted for “section” in the first sentence of subsection (a). The amendment clarified the original purpose of the drafters and Commissioners to permit a Court to implement the intentions of parties to a joint account governed by Section 6-204(b) if it finds that the account was opened solely for the convenience of a party who supplied all funds reflected by the account and intended no present gift or death benefit for the other party. In short, the account characteristics described in this section must be determined by reference to the form of the account and the impact of Sections 6-203 and 6-204 on the admissibility of extrinsic evidence tending to confirm or contradict intention as signalled by the form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) applies to both POD and Totten trust beneficiaries. See Section 6-201(8) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-02(8)] (“POD designation” defined). It accepts the New York view that an account opened by “A” in A’s name as “trustee for B” usually is intended by A to be an informal will of any balance remaining on deposit at A’s death.

      <p>
       Under this section, rights of parties and beneficiaries are determined by the type of account at the time of death. It is to be noted that only a “party” may give notice blocking the provisions of Section 6-212 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-09] (rights at death). “Party” is defined by Section 6-201(6) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-02(6)]. Thus if there is an account with a POD designation in the name of A and B with C as beneficiary, C cannot change the right of survivorship because C has no present right to payment and hence is not a party.

      <p>
       Former Section 6-215 became unnecessary with the approval in 1998 of Section 6-102. The former section, titled “Rights of Creditors and Others”, imposed potential liability on survivor beneficiaries of multiple-person bank accounts for the debts of a deceased party and statutory allowances owed by the decedent’s estate. Section 6-102 is more comprehensive, subjecting other types of nonprobate transfers to creditor claims and statutory allowances.

   N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-12; also, several beneficiaries had no present interest in the COD as a payable on death account. Moreover, there was nothing to show whether a conservator was aware that the money had been in payable on death account as part of an estate plan or whether the conservator even knew that he had the power to return the funds to the pre-theft state.
   Thus, remand was necessary for an evidentiary hearing as to whether the conservator properly exercised its powers under N.D.C.C. ch. 30.1-29. Allmaras v. Manly (In re Estate of Allmaras), 2007 ND 130, 737 N.W.2d 612, 2007 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 137</cite> (N.D. 2007).

       Section 6-216 does not affect or limit the right of the financial institution to make payments pursuant to Subpart 3 (protection of financial institutions) and the deposit agreement. See Section 6-206 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-07] (applicability of part). For this reason, Section 6-216 does not affect the definiteness and certainty that the financial institution must have in order to be induced to make payments from the account and, at the same time, the section preserves the rights of the parties, creditors, and successors that arise out of the nature of the funds in the account-community or separate, or tenancy by the entireties.

Section 6-226 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-19] (discharge). Paragraph (1) applies to both a multiple-party account with right of survivorship and a multiple-party account without right of survivorship (including an account in tenancy in common form). Paragraph (2) is limited to a multiple-party account with right of survivorship; payment to the personal representative or heirs or devisees of a deceased party to an account without right of survivorship is governed by the general law of the state relating to the authority of such persons to collect assets alleged to belong to a decedent.

       This section is intended to protect a financial institution that makes a payment pursuant to an account with an agency designation even though the agency may have terminated at the time of the payment due to disability, incapacity, or death of the principal. The protection does not apply if the financial institution has received notice under Section 6-226 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-19] not to make payment or that the agency has terminated. This section applies whether or not the agency survives the party’s disability or incapacity under Section 6-205 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-06] (designation of agent).

       The provision of subsection (a) [subsection (1)] protecting a financial institution for payments made after the death, disability, or incapacity of a party is a specific elaboration of the general protective provisions of this section and is drawn from Uniform Commercial Code Section 4-405 [N.D.C.C. § 41-04-36].
      </p>
      <p>
       Knowledge of disability, incapacity, or death of a party does not affect payment on request of an agent, whether or not the agent’s authority survives disability or incapacity. See Section 6-224 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-17] (payment to designated agent). But under subsection (b), the financial institution may not make payments on request of an agent after it has received written notice not to, whether because the agency has terminated or otherwise.

This amendment, made in association with a similar technical amendment to Section 6-213 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-10], was not intended to change the meaning of the section.

       “Security” is defined as provided in UCC § 8-102 [N.D.C.C. § 41-08-02] and includes shares of mutual funds and other investment companies. The defined term “security account” is not intended to include securities held in the name of a bank or similar institution as nominee for the benefit of a trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Survive” is not defined. No effort is made in this part to define survival as it is for purposes of intestate succession in UPC § 2-104 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-04-04] which requires survival by an heir of the ancestor for 120 hours. For purposes of this part, survive is used in its common law sense of outliving another for any time interval no matter how brief. The drafting committee sought to avoid imposition of a new and unfamiliar meaning of the term on intermediaries familiar with the meaning of “survive” in joint tenancy registrations.

      <p>
       This section is designed to prevent co-owners from designating any death beneficiary other than one who is to take only upon survival of all co-owners. It coerces co-owning registrants to signal whether they hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship (JT TEN), as tenants by the entireties (T ENT), or as owners of community property. Also, it imposes survivorship on co-owners holding in a beneficiary form that fails to specify a survivorship form of holding. Tenancy in common and community property otherwise than in a survivorship setting is negated for registration in beneficiary form because persons desiring to signal independent death beneficiaries for each individual’s fractional interest in a co-owned security normally will split their holding into separate registrations of the number of units previously constituting their fractional share. Once divided, each can name his or her own choice of death beneficiary.

       The term “individuals,” as used in this section, limits those who may register as owner or co-owner of a security in beneficiary form to natural persons. However, the section does not restrict individuals using this ownership form as to their choice of death beneficiary. The definition of “beneficiary form” in Section 6-301 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-21] indicates that any “person” may be designated beneficiary in a registration in beneficiary form. “Person” is defined so that a church, trust company, family corporation, or other entity, as well as any individual, may be designated as a beneficiary. Section 1-201(29) [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-01-06].

      A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity’s principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the owner’s address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or similar legislation is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

       This section encourages registrations in beneficiary form to be made whenever a state with which either of the parties to a registration has contact has enacted this or a similar statute. Thus, a registration in beneficiary form of X Company shares might rely on an enactment of this Act in X Company’s state of incorporation, or in the state of incorporation of X Company’s transfer agent. Or, an enactment by the state of the issuer’s principal office, the transfer agent’s principal office, or of the issuer’s office making the registration also would validate the registration. An enactment of the state of the registering owner’s address at time of registration also might be used for validation purposes.

       The last sentence of this section is designed, as is UPC § 6-101 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-01], to establish a statutory presumption that a general principle of law is available to achieve a result like that made possible by this part.

       The abbreviation POD is included for use without regard for whether the subject is a money claim against an issuer, such as its own note or bond for money loaned, or is a claim to securities evidenced by conventional title documentation. The use of POD in a registration in beneficiary form of shares in an investment company should not be taken as a signal that the investment is to be sold or redeemed on the owner’s death so that the sums realized may be “paid” to the death beneficiary. Rather, only a transfer on death, not a liquidation on death, is indicated. The committee would have used only the abbreviation TOD except for the familiarity, rooted in experience with certificates of deposit and other deposit accounts in banks, with the abbreviation POD as signalling a valid nonprobate death benefit or transfer on death.

       This section simply affirms the right of a sole owner, or the right of all multiple owners, to end a TOD beneficiary registration without the assent of the beneficiary. The section says nothing about how a TOD beneficiary designation may be canceled, meaning that the registering entity’s terms and conditions, if any, may be relevant. See Section 6-310 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-30]. If the terms and conditions have nothing on the point, cancellation of a beneficiary designation presumably would be effected by a reregistration showing a different beneficiary or omitting reference to a TOD beneficiary.

    Ownership on death of owner.

     </h3>
     <p>
      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interests as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

       Even though multiple owners holding in the beneficiary form here authorized hold with right of survivorship, no survivorship rights attend the positions of multiple beneficiaries who become entitled to securities by reason of having survived the sole owner or the last to die of multiple owners. Issuers (and registering entities) who decide to accept registrations in beneficiary form involving more than one primary beneficiary also should provide by rule whether fractional shares will be registered in the names of surviving beneficiaries where the number of shares held by the deceased owner does not divide without remnant among the survivors. If fractional shares are not desired, the issuer may wish to provide for sale of odd shares and division of proceeds, for an uneven distribution with the first or last named to receive the odd share, or for other resolution. Section 6-308 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-28] deals with whether intermediaries have any obligation to offer beneficiary registrations of any sort; Section 6-310 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-30] enables issuers to adopt terms and conditions controlling the details of applications for registrations they decide to accept and procedures for implementing such registrations after an owner’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference to surviving, multiple TOD beneficiaries as tenants in common is not intended to suggest that a registration form specifying unequal shares, such as “TOD A (20%), B (30%), C (50%),” would be improper. Though not included in the beneficiary forms described for illustrative purposes in Section 6-310, the part enables a registering entity to accept and implement a TOD beneficiary designation like the one just suggested. If offered, such a registration form should be implemented by registering entity terms and conditions providing for disposition of the share of a beneficiary who predeceases the owner when two or more of a group of multiple beneficiaries survive the owner. For example, the terms might direct the share of the predeceased beneficiary to the survivors in the proportion that their original shares bore to each other. Unless unequal shares are specified in a registration in beneficiary form designating multiple beneficiaries, the shares of the beneficiaries would, of course, be equal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The statement that a security registered in beneficiary form is in the deceased owner’s estate when no beneficiary survives the owner is not intended to prevent application of any anti-lapse statute that might direct a nonprobate transfer on death to the surviving issue of a beneficiary who failed to survive the owner. Rather, the statement is intended only to indicate that the registering entity involved should transfer or reregister the security as directed by the decedent’s personal representative.

       “Good faith” as used in this section is intended to mean “honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade,” as specified in UCC § 2-103(1)(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       The protections described in this section are designed to meet any questions regarding registering entity protection that may not be foreclosed by issuer protections provided in the Uniform Commercial Code. Because persons interested in this part may wish to be reminded of relevant UCC provisions, a brief summary follows.
      </p>
      <p>
       “U.C.C. § 8-403, ‘Issuer’s Duty as to Adverse Claims’ contains detailed provisions regarding duties of inquiry by an issuer of a certificated or uncertificated security who is requested to effect a transfer, and the availability and use of 30 day notices to force adverse claimants to start litigation if further delay in transfer is desired. U.C.C. § 8-201’s definition of ‘issuer’ for purposes of ‘registration of transfer....’ is simply ‘a person on whose behalf transfer books are maintained’. U.C.C. § 8-403 is among the sections dealing with registration of transfers.
      </p>
      <p>
       “U.C.C. sections 8-308 and 8-404(1) appear to exonerate an issuer who acts in response to transfer directions signalled by the ‘necessary endorsement’[sic] on or with a certificated security or in response to ‘an instruction originated by an appropriate person’ in the case of an uncertificated security. Section 8-308 describes the meaning of ‘appropriate person’ in the case of a certificated security as ‘the person specified by the certificated security ... to be entitled to the security.’ U.C.C. § 8-308(6) (1978). In the case of an uncertificated security, ‘appropriate person’ means the ‘registered owner.’ Id. § 8-308(7). The survivor of owners listed as joint tenants with right of survivorship is specifically defined as an authorized person. Id. § 8-308(8)(d). The U.C.C. aspect of the problem could be met by an additional sub-paragraph to section 8-308(8) that would include a TOD beneficiary as an ‘appropriate person’ when the beneficiary has survived the owner.
      </p>
      <p>
       “No U.C.C. addition would be necessary if a TOD beneficiary designation were viewed as a contingent order for transfer at the owner’s death that may be safely implemented as a direction from the owner as an ‘authorized person.’ The owner’s death before completion of the transfer would not pose U.C.C. problems because section 8-308(10) provides: ‘Whether the person signing is appropriate is determined as of the date of signing and an indorsement made by or an instruction originated by him does not become unauthorized for the purposes of this Article by virtue of any subsequent change of circumstances.’
      </p>
      <p>
       “It might be questioned whether a TOD direction, which may be revoked before it is carried into effect and is also contingent on the beneficiary’s survival of the registrant, is within the transfer directions contemplated by the U.C.C. framers for purposes of issuer protection. However, since section 8-202 explicitly protects issuers against problems arising because of restrictions or conditions on transfers, only the novelty of revocable directions for transfer on death gives pause.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In general, article 8 of the U.C.C. reflects a careful attempt to protect implementation of a wide range of transfer instructions so long as the signatures are genuine and are those of owners acting in conformity with duly imposed rules of the issuer organization... Hence, existing U.C.C. protections should be adequate,...”

       A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests for registrations in beneficiary form and for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered T.O.D. beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary’s descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary’s death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters L.D.P.S., standing for “lineal descendants per stirpes”. This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary’s descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary’s domicile at the owner’s death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity’s terms and conditions.

       Use of “and” or “or” between the names of persons registered as co-owners is unnecessary under this part and should be discouraged. If used, the two words should have the same meaning insofar as concerns a title form; i.e., that of “and” to indicate that both named persons own the asset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Descendants of a named beneficiary who take by virtue of a “LDPS” designation appended to a beneficiary’s name take as TOD beneficiaries rather than as intestate successors. If no descendant of a predeceased primary beneficiary survives the owner, the security passes as a part of the owner’s estate as provided in Section 6-307 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-27].

        PREFATORY NOTE.
       </b>
       This amendment of Uniform Probate Code Article VI (nonprobate transfers) replaces former Article VI with a revised article. Part 1 (provisions relating to effect of death) of the revised article is amended and relocated from former Part 2. Part 2 (multiple-person accounts) of the revised article is amended and relocated from former Part 1. Part 3 (Uniform TOD Security Registration Act) of the revised article is new. This reorganization allows for general provisions at the beginning of the article, and permits parts to be divided into subparts that group related provisions together.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Multiple-Person Accounts.
       </b>
       The amendment of Part 2 (multiple-person accounts) of the revised article simplifies drafting and terminology. It consolidates treatment of POD accounts and trust accounts so that the same rules apply to both, since both types of account operate identically and serve the same function of passing property to a beneficiary at the death of the account owner. The amendment likewise eliminates references to “joint” accounts, since the statute treats joint tenancy accounts and tenancy in common accounts the same for all purposes other than survivorship. Other terminological and drafting simplifications and standardizations are made throughout the statute. Treatment of existing accounts is included.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment makes a few substantive changes in rules previously established in the multiple-person account statute. The changes include recognition of checks issued by an account owner before death and presented for payment after death, revision of the creditor rights procedure to enable a survivor or beneficiary to spread the burden among survivors and beneficiaries of other accounts of the decedent and to provide a uniform one-year limitation period for creditors, and a provision that a financial institution must have received notice at the appropriate office and have had a reasonable time to act before it is charged with knowledge that any change in account circumstances has occurred. A provision is also added that on the death of a married person, beneficial ownership of the decedent’s share in a survivorship account passes to the surviving spouse who is an account party in preference to other surviving account parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amendment includes a number of important improvements designed to make multiple-person accounts more useful. An agency designation is authorized to enable an account owner to add another person to the account as a convenience in making withdrawals without creating any ownership or survivorship interest in the person identified as an agent. Optional statutory forms for multiple-person accounts are provided for the convenience and protection of financial institutions. Payment to a minor who is an account beneficiary is authorized pursuant to the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. A provision is added to make clear that marital funds deposited in an account retain any community property incidents, and the law governing tenancy by the entireties is preserved where applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The drafting committee believes that this amendment of the multiple-person account statute is a substantial improvement in an already successful law. This part of the Uniform Probate Code is one of the most broadly accepted, having been adopted either as part of the code or independently by over half the states. This amendment draws on useful improvements made by various states that have enacted the statute, and should make the statute even more attractive.

       <b>
        Uniform TOD Security Registration Act.
       </b>
       The purpose of Part 3 (Uniform TOD Security Registration Act) of the revised article is to allow the owner of securities to register the title in transfer-on-death (TOD) form. Mutual fund shares and accounts maintained by brokers and others to reflect a customer’s holdings of securities (so-called “street accounts”) are also covered. The legislation enables an issuer, transfer agent, broker, or other such intermediary to transfer the securities directly to the designated transferee on the owner’s death. Thus, TOD registration achieves for securities a certain parity with existing TOD and pay-on-death (POD) facilities for bank deposits and other assets passing at death outside the probate process.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TOD registration under this part is designed to give the owner of securities who wishes to arrange for a nonprobate transfer at death an alternative to the frequently troublesome joint tenancy form of title. Because joint tenancy registration of securities normally entails a sharing of lifetime entitlement and control, it works satisfactorily only so long as the co-owners cooperate. Difficulties arise when co-owners fall into disagreement, or when one becomes afflicted or insolvent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the TOD registration form encouraged by this legislation has no effect on the registered owner’s full control of the affected security during his or her lifetime. A TOD designation and any beneficiary interest arising under the designation ends whenever the registered asset is transferred, or whenever the owner otherwise complies with the issuer’s conditions for changing the title form of the investment. The part recognizes, in Section 6-302 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-22], that co-owners with right of survivorship may be registered as owners together with a TOD beneficiary designated to take if the registration remains unchanged until the beneficiary survives the joint owners. In such a case, the survivor of the joint owners has full control of the asset and may change the registration form as he or she sees fit after the other’s death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Implementation of the part is wholly optional with issuers. The drafting committee received the benefit of considerable advice and assistance from representatives of the mutual fund and stock transfer industries during the course of its three years of preparatory work. Accordingly, it is believed that this part takes full account of the practical requirements for efficient transfer within the securities industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 6-303 [N.D.C.C. § 30.1-31-23] invites application of the legislation to locally owned securities though the statute may not have been locally enacted, so long as the part or similar legislation is in force in a jurisdiction of the issuer or transfer agent. Thus, if the principal jurisdictions in which securities issuers and transfer agents are sited enact the measure, its benefits will become generally available to persons domiciled in states that do not at once enact the statute.
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislation has been drafted as a separate part, hence not interpolated as an expansion of the former UPC Article VI, Part 1, treating bank accounts (“multiple-party accounts”). Securities merit a distinct statutory regime, because a different principle has governed concurrent ownership of securities. By virtue either of statute or of account terms (contract), multiple-party bank accounts allow any one cotenant to consume or transfer account balances. See R. Brown, The Law of Personal Property § 65, at 217 (2d ed. 1955); Langbein, The Nonprobate Revolution and the Future of the Law of Succession, 97 Harv.L.Rev. 1108, 1112 (1984). The rule for securities, however, has been the rule that applies to real property: all cotenants must act together in transferring the securities. This difference in the legal regime reflects differences in function among the types of assets. Multiple-party bank accounts typically arise as convenience accounts, to facilitate frequent small transactions, often on an agency basis (as when spouses or relatives share an account). Securities resemble real estate in that the values are typically large and the transactions relatively infrequent, which is why the legal regime requires the concurrence of all concurrent owners for transfers affecting such assets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recently, of course, this distinction between bank accounts and securities has begun to crumble. Banks are offering certificates of deposit of large value under the same account forms that were devised for low-value convenience accounts. Meanwhile, brokerage houses with their so-called cash management accounts and mutual funds with their money market accounts have rendered securities subject to small recurrent transactions. In the latest developments, even the line between real estate and bank accounts is becoming indistinct, as the “home equity line of credit” creates a check-writing conduit to real estate values.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, even though new forms of contract have rendered the boundaries between securities and bank accounts less firm, the distinction seems intuitively correct for statutory default rules. True co-owners of securities, like owners of realty, should act together in transferring the asset.
      </p>
      <p>
       The joint bank account and the Totten trust originated in ambiguous lifetime ownership forms, which required former UPC § 6-103 or comparable state legislation to clarity that an inter vivos transfer was not intended. In the securities field, by contrast, we start with unambiguous lifetime ownership rules. The sole purpose of the present statute is to facilitate a nonprobate TOD mechanism as an option for those owners.
      </p>

        This section and N.D.C.C. § 30.1-08-08, concerning execution requirements for a valid will, are not applicable to an instrument attempted to be established as a will where the execution of such instrument and the death of the maker of the instrument occur before the effective date of such sections.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Prior discretionary application of old probate procedures did not fix procedural rights for the eternity of the probated estates. It is axiomatic that procedural modes, as distinguished, from substantive rights, are not vested and are subject to repeal, modification or change. In re Estate of Kjorvestad, 375 N.W.2d 160, 1985 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 408</cite> (N.D. 1985).

       <p>
        Before the Uniform Probate Code provisions apply to a will executed before the effective date of such code, the will must have been validly executed; such validity is determined by the law that existed at the time of the will’s execution. In re Estate of Thomas, 290 N.W.2d 223, 1980 <cite class="nd_code">N.D. LEXIS 196</cite> (N.D. 1980).
