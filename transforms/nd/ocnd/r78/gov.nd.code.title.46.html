      The Constitution of North Dakota must be published in a format that will correlate and integrate all constitutional provisions in a numbering arrangement that avoids ambiguity and duplication and that aids in placing constitutional amendments into the constitution. The Constitution of North Dakota, as presently numbered and arranged, must be republished in this new format by the legislative council. The publication of the constitution under the format authorized by this section must be accomplished when the code volume containing the constitution is replaced.

      To effect uniformity, the office of management and budget may compute a standard price on those legal notices which are widely published such as ballots, insurance statements, and official proclamations. All newspapers must use the rates, type size, and column width as shown on its legal notice rate certification issued by the office of management and budget. Certifications must be issued within fifteen days after samples are submitted, or as soon thereafter as practicable.

     <p>
      The office of management and budget shall biennially review and adjust rates to reflect changes in economic conditions within the newspaper industry and the general economy, and those adjustments become effective on each July first following the review. These biennial changes may be percentage increases or decreases in the base rates, and they may incorporate revisions in the base rate structure. Whenever the office of management and budget considers an adjustment in the legal publication rates contained herein, it shall consult with representatives of the daily and weekly newspaper industry of the state and with representatives of state and local units of government.
